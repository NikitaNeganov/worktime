They could be murderers or the carriers of unusual pathogens. And I'm not insane, my mother had me tested.</p>", "8": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, what is going on?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We just want you to be prepared for any surprises that could happen tomorrow.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What surprises?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We don't want to spoil anything, but you should know that Sheldon said he's ready to be physical.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You shut your damn mouth!

Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Of course it is.

I was on the phone with my mother.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How is she?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Pretty good. She bought the book \"Eat, Pray, Love\", and used it to set my father's Mercedes on fire.</p>", "26": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny. We are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began.

You do.</p>", "28": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, well your Ken can kiss my Barbie.</p>", "29": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hang on, if you're making all this money, where is it? <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> In a safe place. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What does that mean, under your bed? <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. I'm not overly conservative. I'm young, so my guy said I can afford to take some risks.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait a minute, you have \"a guy\"? <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Don't you have a guy? <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why would I have a guy?! I don't have any money!</p>", "30": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> (To Amy) If you were having Sheldon's baby, would you really want him in the room?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, if he's in the room when they're making the baby, I'll give you $10.</br></p>", "31": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Then it's settled. Amy's birthday present will be my genitals.</p>", "32": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy's mad at me, and I'm not clear why. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, were you talking before she got upset? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's probably it.</p>", "33": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You better find my husband's mother, 'cause one way or another we're walking out of this airport with a dead woman.</p>", "34": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, so she's good enough for Howard but not for me?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah. Go have weird relationships with your own mother and cousin. This is his turf.</p>", "35": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Doesn't anyone have a rod of resurrection?  Because if you've got one, I need it bad. Get in here with your rod and give it to me.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Okay, you need to say these things in your head before you say them out loud.</p>", "36": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I've said this before and I'll say it again: Aquaman sucks!</p>", "37": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> How are the taxes going?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay, but you've got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Those are business expenses. You can write those off.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> A $200 R2-D2 is a business expense?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, Bernie, you're gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited.</p>", "38": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days later, Penny moved in and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town.</p>", "39": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> If I take it off, Sheldon wins.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sweetie, every night you don't kill him in his sleep, he wins.</p>", "40": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This song is never going to stop. Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's a trick question, right?</p>", "41": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What am I supposed to do?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Err, keep your mouth off other women.</p>", "42": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You don't go into science for the money.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Speak for yourself. Last month my company both invented and cured restless eye syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps!</p>", "43": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I remember the song! It's called \"Darlin'\" by the Beach Boys! Oh, thank goodness! I'm not crazy! I don't have to take a pigeon as my bride!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> There goes our shot at him living on the roof.</p>", "44": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-Giving.</p>", "45": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> You and me both, brother.</br></p>", "46": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> (Whispers) Here she comes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick doesn't hear you!</p>", "47": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I told you you shouldn't have espresso after dinner. I know the little cups make you feel big but it's not worth it.</p>", "48": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Aww, Raj did the dishes.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> How do you know I didn't do them? <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Because once when all the knives were dirty, you cut a bagel with your keys.</br></p>", "49": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Can you see how a grown man and accomplished scientist who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colorful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Then I think it's a terrific idea.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Great! Wait until you hear about our van.</p>", "50": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You mean a fork lift?</p>", "51": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (Shouting from the bathroom) How many times do I have to tell you to replace the toilet paper when it's empty?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm in the middle of something.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So am I!</p>", "52": "<p><strong><strong>Howard:</strong></strong> I'm not signing a prenup.<br/><strong><strong>Penny:</strong></strong> All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up!  You sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women, it is not going to happen, we had a meeting.</p>", "53": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Hey look, they named their team after me!</p>", "54": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Howard, it's the phone.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I know it's the phone, Ma. I can hear the phone.<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Well who's calling at this ungodly hour?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know.<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Well ask them why they're calling at this ungodly hour.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> How can I ask them when I'm talking to you?</p>", "55": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane, wrapped helically around an axis?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Screwed.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> There you go.<br/></p>", "56": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> One question. How can you be sure it won't blow up?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The laser?<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> The moon.<br/></p>", "57": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, this is confusing for me. But I don't want to stand in the way of your happiness. So, I will condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance.<br/><strong>Mary:</strong> That is very Christian of you.</p>", "58": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, let's just recap our options. We've got harp thing, sheep thing-<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Wild thang.</p>", "59": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Ugh? The bible is ugh to you?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> No, I'm sorry. That was inappropriate. As a psychiatrist, I know how important people's superstitions can be to them.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> You want to talk about superstitions. Sheldon sent me all those books you wrote. All that nonsense about super egos and IDs. What bull dropped that on the barn floor?</p>", "60": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Settle this. Those little animated pictures on the Internet, are they called \"gifs\" or \"jifs\"? <br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, the G stands for \"graphics.\" That's a hard G, so I'd say \"gif.\" <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What? The guy who invented it says it's \"jif.\" <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?</br></p>", "61": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well you wouldn't have asked me either.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I would have asked you. In my head. On the way home. While I was having a good cry.</p>", "62": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> We're all pathetic and creepy, and can't get girls. That's why we fight robots.</p>", "63": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We're here to see Koothrappali, not kill Batman.</p>", "64": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Our babies will be smart and beautiful.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Not to mention imaginary.\n</p>", "65": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Does your mother call you every day at work to see if you had a healthy lunch?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> My mother calls me every day at work to see if I had a healthy bowel movement.</p>", "66": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, for the remainder of my speech, this is for the invisible kids. Maybe you never fit in. Or maybe you were the smallest kid in the school. Or the heaviest. Or the weirdest. Maybe you're graduating and you still haven't even had your first kiss. By the way, nineteen, and Geraldine Coco, wherever you are, thank you. Maybe you don't have any friends, and guess what, that's okay. While all the popular kids are off doing whatever - I don't know what they're doing because I was never there.</p>", "67": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, what did we say about being a nicer friend?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weeny?</br></p>", "68": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (3 knocks) Penny! (3 knocks) Penny! (3 knocks) Penny!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What happens if I say come in?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, find out.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Come in!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (silence)<br/>\n(3 knocks) Bernadette! (3 knocks) Bernadette! (3 knocks) Bernadette!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Come in!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Keep it up. I've got nowhere else to be.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Just come in.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For future reference, if I want to watch Mean Girls, I'll just stream it on Netflix.</p>", "69": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> We have to go over some ground rules about Emily.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Like when it turns out she's made of rubber, I don't say anything?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> She's very real.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's what it says on the box. Right next to dishwasher safe.</p>", "70": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've changed. Like the frog who's put in a pot of water that's heated so gradually, he doesn't realize he's boiling to death.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Or you're the frog who's been kissed by the princess and turned into a prince.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Or you're just a tall, annoying frog.</p>", "71": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Jewelry? Seriously? Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centered person I have ever met! Do you really think another transparently manipulative - Oh, it's a tiara! Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me.</p>", "72": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Everyone's a better mom than me.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, don't take it so personally, maybe your baby's just a jerk.</p>", "73": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know why. You've come to me because you're my Obi-Wan.<br/><strong>Arthur:</strong> I'm not familiar with that. Is that an Internet?</p>", "74": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  Can I ask you a question?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, sure.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  Why do you put up with Sheldon?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, you know because we're friends.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  Why?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wow, you ask really hard questions. Look, I know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is he's not doing it on purpose, it's just how he is. But he's also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  You know you're describing a dog?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He did bite me once. But in his defense, I came up behind him while he was eating.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> They hate that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon is the smartest person I have met. He's a little broken and he needs me. And I guess I need him too.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  Why is that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Boy, you will not let this go, will you?</p>", "75": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, you're a condescending jerk. Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> To go to Jewish heaven.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Jews don't have heaven.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> To avoid Jewish hell?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell.</br></p>", "76": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Jacuzzi is a commercial brand, hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Is that like all thumbs are fingers but not all fingers are thumbs?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Surprisingly, yes.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Nice! Now what exactly are toes?</p>", "77": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> My arm is feeling numb. *Howard rubs his right arm*<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's the wrong arm for a heart-attack, doofus.<br>\n*Howard switches to his left arm*</br></br></p>", "78": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Gosh, Amy. I'm sensing a little hostility. Is it maybe because like Sheldon's work, your sex life is also theoretical?            </p>", "79": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?<br>\nEmily: Erm, okay, I guess.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm with him three years, nothing. She's with him two minutes and he's taking his pants off.</br></p>", "80": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Hold on. The costume came with a black wig. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No. I'm not wearing it. It looks stupid. <br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Come on. We're trying to win a contest here. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Forget it. I'm not wearing the wig. <br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Honey, there is no \"I\" in \"Justice League.\"<br/></p>", "81": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You'll never guess what just happened.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an inter-dimensional portal, which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you're back, to bring us all with you to the year 7010, where we are transported to work at the think-a-torium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?  <br><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Awww.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny kissed me.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who would ever guess that?</br></br></br></br></br></p>", "82": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm exceedingly smart. I graduated college at fourteen. While my brother was getting an STD, I was getting a Ph.D. Penicillin can't take this away.</p>", "83": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I should probably tell you something about this gift.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You mean, before you <em>give it to me</em>?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. But may I ask you a question before I <em>give it to you</em>?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Of course.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why are we saying <em>give it to you</em> like that?</p>", "84": "<p><strong>Josh:</strong> So, I have to ask, was the robot sexy? <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It was actually just a mechanical hand. <br/><strong>Josh:</strong> 'Cause that's all you need, right? <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You are my brother.</p>", "85": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I mean, who even reads Scientific American?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's kind of a big deal.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> If it's such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?</p>", "86": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Howard, cow tipping - real or not?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm going to say not. That's just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she's snoring.<br/></p>", "87": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> It's all themed. There's Jonah and the Whale Watching. All-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet. And my personal favorite, Gunning with God.\n</p>", "88": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> But enough about Penny, let's talk about us. We're looking good.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We are.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Better than good. I mean look at you, your body's bangin'.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Amy!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Don't Amy me. We're always talking about how hot Penny is. Come on, scientist to scientist, how big are those hadron colliders?</p>", "89": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It's too late. He's been murdered by someone in this room. Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm leaving.</p>", "90": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What do you mean new roommate? What happened to Leonard?\n<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species.\n<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm the new homo in town.\n</br></p>", "91": "<p><strong>Raj</strong>: Well, I'm a Hindu. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and I'm reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings.</p>", "92": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock knock joke that starts \"Knock Knock Knock, Amy. Knock Knock Knock, Amy. Knock Knock Knock, Amy\"?</p>", "93": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I find the notion of romantic love an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships.</p>", "94": "<p>(Howard has just told Mary about his upcoming trip to the International Space Station.)<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> I bet your mom is really proud of you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Nope. She says if I don't back out, she's gonna go on a hunger strike. It'd take years before she'd be in any kind of danger, but still.</p>", "95": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's no denying that I have feelings for you that can't be explained in any other way. I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite, but that seems even more far-fetched. The only conclusion was love.</p>", "96": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm too small for Twister. And roller coasters. And sitting with my feet on the floor. Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom.</p>", "97": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You look beautiful.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Of course I do, I'm a princess and this is my tiara!</br></p>", "98": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> I am so happy for you two, but I'm not surprised. I've been praying for this.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, God had nothing to do with it. It happened because I was kissing another woman, and it made me realize I wanted to be with Amy.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong>More than one woman was interested in you? I might have prayed a little too hard.</br></p>", "99": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I gave you one job! Keep an eye on him. How hard is that?</p>", "100": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Still, I can't believe you can turn ordinary skin cells into functioning brain cells.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I turned this one into a functioning boyfriend, so sky's the limit.</p>", "101": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Oh, great, this again.</p>", "102": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thankfully all the things my girlfriend used to do can be taken care of with my right hand.</p>", "103": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try. <br/><strong>Amy:</strong> *sarcastic* Oh, sure, I'd love to. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Whenever you're ready.</p>", "104": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this--<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Agreed.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I was going to say \"or,\" but why bother?</p>", "105": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, how's it going with the ti<x>tle to the house? <br><strong>Howard:</strong> Great, it's all done. The lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over. I didn't have to meet him, I didn't have to talk to him, I don't even know where he is. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wow, so you're not curious at all? <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Nope. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What if he's in prison? What if he's a spy? What if he's in a Beatles cover band?

I hated that so much.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, there's nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted we could build a fort.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Isn't that a little juvenile?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> More juvenile than this? *Puts up picture of smiling Sheldon to her face*</p>", "107": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't feel bad.

Who's been paying for my coffee.<br/><strong>Dan:</strong> All of us.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yep, it comes from the swear jar we put money in when you curse.</p>", "110": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You better watch that attitude, buddy. You're dating the popular girl now.</p>", "111": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I think what we're all trying to say is that you don't seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong>  Like a woman. Great analogy.</p>", "112": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> I just think splitting up can be rough on kids.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We don't have any kids.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Are you sure?

You might not want to ditch her on her birthday.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But someone might spoil the movie. No one can spoil Amy's birthday for me. Surprise, she's even older. Who saw that coming?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aww, that's nice. Put that on her cake.</br></p>", "124": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> It would be nice to be with a man who wants to know what's underneath my cardigan. FYI, it's another cardigan.</p>", "125": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, big deal.

It happens to everybody.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I'm not everybody. I have an eidetic memory. I should be able to remember what song this is, but I can't.

Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said, \"Maybe if you weren't so distracted by sick children in Africa you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista.\"<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Bam, right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC.\n</br></p>", "149": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, \"If it pleases your highness?\"</p>", "150": "<p><strong>Wolowitz</strong>: If it's \"creepy\" to use the Internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so I can drop in on them unexpected, then fine, I'm \"creepy\".</p>", "151": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'm not bringing your mother. I have a date.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, so now you're cheating on my mother.</br></p>", "152": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aren't you gonna come with me?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> While you confront your mother about her sex life? I'd rather go back to that bar in assless chaps.</p>", "153": "<p><strong>Althea:</strong> What is this?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's a robot arm.<br/><strong>Althea:</strong> Where's the rest of the robot?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I only built the arm.<br/><strong>Althea:</strong> Because that's all you needed, right?</p>", "154": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Cute is for bunnies.

He says Sheldon's drunk and they're gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> That sounds fun.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, no. Sheldon's drunk texting me.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What's it say?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> \"Would you like to sing karaoke with us.\"<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How is that a drunk text?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> He used a period instead of a question mark.

You're getting married and you didn't invite me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It was kind of a spur of the moment thing.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Wow.

But I didn't marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous I'm being.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows.</p>", "167": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> At one point, they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait, Sheldon gave me a banana in a box. He was testing me, too.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Unbelievable.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And how could a chimp even solve that? That was impossible.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? You couldn't get it out?</p>", "168": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I can't believe she's gone. That woman took me in. If it wasn't for her, I would have been homeless. <br/><strong>Amy:</strong> One of us would have taken you in.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Yeah, I don't recall any offers. But you know what, I'm glad it worked out the way it did, because I got to know this wonderful person.</p>", "169": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (In pageant video) And you should pick me for Miss.

I wanna, really, really, be the California Quiznos 1999.</p>", "170": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, we could go horseback riding.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I actually can't. My hips don't open wider than 22 degrees. I rode a very thin pony once. On the first bump I just popped right off.</p>", "171": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Wow, you still have it? I just assumed it was balled up in a corner of a barn somewhere.</p>", "172": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> It was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas for that long, for sale signs start to go up.</p>", "173": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Sheldon, I was actually talking about when I was a kid on Star Trek.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it all boy genius with an eidetic  memory.

Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.</p>", "181": "<p><strong>Howard</strong>: Hey, you want to make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: I'm listening.<br><strong>Howard</strong>: Just tell him to do everything you've done with her for the last two years.</br></br></p>", "182": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> This is why I've been saying we should keep champagne on ice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sarcasm?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That was tricky because when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business.</p>", "183": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton</strong>: Game over, Moonpie.</p>", "184": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I wouldn't tell you the secret. Sssh!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What secret? Tell me the secret.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we can't tell dad.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not that secret, the other secret.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm Batman! Ssssh!</p>", "185": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So what do you say Sheldon, are we your X-men?<br/><strong><strong>Sheldon:</strong></strong> No, the X-men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-men.</p>", "186": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> She didn't even get to see my penis.</p>", "187": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What would you guys do if you were me?<br/><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> I would take Sheldon to Switzerland.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Seriously?<br/><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Absolutely.

Today's the day a girl's finally going to touch you in your little special place. *Kicks him in the groin*</p>", "189": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ignore them, Amy. They're just jealous because they'll never have a relationship as good as ours.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Isn't this when he says \"bazooka\" or something?</br></p>", "190": "<p><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> I'm a horny engineer, Leonard.

She's like the dryer sheets of my heart!</p>", "195": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special. When I first moved to America, Howard was my only friend, and she made me feel so welcome in her home. Which says a lot, because those first few years she thought I was the gardener.</p>", "196": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> People change names on blogs to protect their privacy.

And thanks to Sheldon's heated discussion with my manager, one barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon, and cheese on the side.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Go ahead. Eat it. I dare you!</p>", "207": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny, I told you if you don't put him in his crate at night, he just runs around the apartment.\n</p>", "208": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so don't operate heavy machinery, and try not to choke on your own drool. <br> *Sheldon is is about to leave.* <br> <strong>Penny</strong>: Wait! You have to help me get into bed. (laughs) \"Sheldon has to help me get into bed\". Bet you thought I'd never say that! <br/> <strong>Sheldon</strong>: Yes. Charmed.

What do I know about Amy? She loves medieval literature. Chaucer's her favorite. And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies. And I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if she's playing along.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Wow, you really do love her.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I do. Now, let's find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless.</p>", "212": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: I don't believe it. What's gotten into him?\n<br/><strong>Penny</strong>: Oh, maybe a couple of virgin Cuba Libres that turned out to be kinda slutty.\n<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: You didn't.\n<br/><strong>Penny</strong>: Hey, you do your little experiments, I do mine.\n</p>", "213": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny, you don't want to get into it with Sheldon. The guy's one lab accident away from being a super villain.<br/></p>", "214": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> If you're keeping him, I've got a cage you can borrow. One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. It was both tragic and hysterical.</p>", "215": "<p><strong>Wolowitz</strong> (watching America's Next Top Model): Oh, look! That's the future Mrs. Wolowitz. No, wait! That's the future Mrs. Wolowitz. With her head in the lap of... what a coincidence... it's the future Mrs. Wolowitz.\n<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: Yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother. The current Mrs. Wolowitz.\n</br></p>", "216": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.</p>", "217": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You gotta like this: the girlfriend, the ex-girlfriend, bonding over your rooty-tooty stinky booty? (All but Leonard laugh)<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Kill me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It wouldn't help. The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.</p>", "218": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Shut your ass!</p>", "219": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, what are you guys doing here?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We're grown men, we drink at bars.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No and no. Everything okay with you and Bernadette?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh yeah, sure.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You and Amy?  Good?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, better than good.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.\n</p>", "220": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Bernadette, I want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honor. I also want you to know that I will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out.</p>", "221": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I've always been a little confused about this. Why don't Hindus eat beef?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> We believe cows are gods.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God.\n<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood I'm in, I'll take you out, I swear to cow!</br></br></br></p>", "222": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: What were you doing at Penny's?<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Well, we had dinner, played some games, and then I spent the night. Oh, and you'll be happy to know that I now have a much better understanding of 'friends with benefits.'</br></p>", "223": "<p><strong>Sheldon: </strong> I am not crazy, my mother had me tested.</p>", "224": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Checkmate.\n<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: Oh, again?\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Obviously, you're not suited for three dimensional chess. Perhaps three dimensional Candy Land would be more your speed.<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: Just reset the board!<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It must be humbling to suck on so many levels.</br></br></br></br></p>", "225": "<p><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> I, uh, I would also like to make a toast.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Aww.<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> Leonard, I am so happy that you have found a woman who loves and cares for you.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> What the hell is that supposed to mean?<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> Why don't you take a pill?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Like you did before sex?<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> What I really needed was a blindfold.</br></p>", "226": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you hungry? How about that sushi place you love?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Doctor said I can't have sushi.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, look, we don't have to go anywhere. We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Doctor said I can't go in the hot tub.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Maybe you should get a new doctor. What, he said you can't laugh either?</p>", "227": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hi. You're on Fun with Flags.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Hello. I want to talk about how lonely I am, too.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Kripke? Is that you?<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Yeah, I'm just sitting here all by myself wondering if I'll ever find someone to share my life with. Preferably Asian, 18-24, no fatties.</p>", "228": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perhaps I should explain. While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, Sheldon, thank you. That's so romantic. But what about Rajesh? He was okay with you choosing the name?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, it took a little negotiating, but I wore him down. Uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and I have children, they all have to be named Rajesh.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> All of them?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Even the girls.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, I think I know what to say now.</p>", "229": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is Leonard. He's your best friend in the world.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, just stop. This is ridiculous.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with your life. And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you.</p>", "230": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, not just date night. Our 5th anniversary. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, see, that's even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If that happens, don't make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can.</p>", "231": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, wait. What if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, as long as we're suspending the parameters. I could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's a big step.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's a big fort.</p>", "232": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on, we are not old, boring people. We can do better than this.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's true. How late did we stay up last night?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Almost 1 am.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Damn straight almost 1 am. And we weren't even watching TV, we were watching Netflix like the kids do.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. Is it a comedy, is it a drama? Nobody knows!</p>", "233": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Are you okay?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, I'm not okay. I feel like I'm going to jump out of my skin.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I told you not to wax down there. It's itchy when it grows back.</p>", "234": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Before you finish, is this a story about patience or waiting, or just another reminder that you went to space?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> A story can do two things.</p>", "235": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I love that you take pride in your looks. Even when I have to pee in the morning and you're in there spending an hour on your hair.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I love that you're too good to pee in the kitchen sink.</p>", "236": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Guess who won a hundred dollars playing craps?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's a dollar.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Guess who wildly over-tipped a cocktail waitress?</p>", "237": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't have (Valentine's) plans, which is why I booked time on the big telescope that night.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> An evening looking at the stars, that's still kinda romantic.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Except I'd be alone.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm trying to  put lipstick on a pig here. Work with me.</p>", "238": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What is your problem?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's Valentine's day. We're supposed to be having a romantic weekend.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, really? 'cause I remember you saying this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. Did you mean that or were you just trying to trick me?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Fine, it's true. I deserve romance and I didn't know how else to make it happen.</p>", "239": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food.</p>", "240": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Run to India.</p>", "241": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Yes, yes, yes. He's a jolly good fellow. What time do the strippers arrive?</p>", "242": "<p><strong>Mary:</strong> Back home, there's a woman works at the Wal-Mart - tall, tall girl. Woman could hunt geese with a rake.</p>", "243": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hell hound.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Who let the satanic dogs out?</br></p>", "244": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> Who's there? Are you a sex criminal?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sex criminals don't have key, ma!<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> Where were you so late?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I was out with Bernadette<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> I know what that means, I watch Dr. Phil. I hope to God you used a condom.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I am not having this conversation with you, ma.<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> God forbid you get one of them fancy sex diseases.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Nobody has a disease!<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong>I hope not. I share a toilet with you. Is that what you want, to give your mother herpes?</p>", "245": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Whoa, You dated Penny?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> She didn't tell you?<br><strong>Zack:</strong> She told me she dated a guy named Leonard. Who would have thought it was you?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Who else would it be?<br><strong>Zack:</strong> I don't know. Somebody bigger and - yeah, sure. Why not you?</br></br></br></br></p>", "246": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'd suggest using some lubricant, but I have a feeling you fell on that as well.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Not funny, Leonard.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, come on, dude. A robot hand's got a death grip on your junk. It's funny. Ask anyone.</p>", "247": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> She didnt dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographical location.<br><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Its very simple. Leonard was living in a little town called \"Please don't leave me\", while Penny had just moved to the island of \"Bye-bye!\"</br></br></p>", "248": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun.<br>\nZack: Smart.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Now, we'll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won't be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye.<br>\nZack: (chuckling) Naked.</br></br></br></p>", "249": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I'm very unhappy that you turned it into a double date. I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The plural of coccyx is coccyges.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.</br></p>", "250": "<p><strong>Raj</strong>: What do you say, Howard?\n<br/><strong>Howard</strong>: I say Vegas baby!\n<br/><strong>Raj</strong>: What are you gonna tell your mother?\n<br/><strong>Howard</strong>: Sea World baby!\n</p>", "251": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Should I ask Leonard to bring over your homework?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't have homework. I'm a grown man with a master's degree in engineering.<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Excuse me, Mr. Fancy Pants. Want me to get you a popsicle?</p>", "252": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Um, Penny, that's where I sit.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So, sit next to me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I sit there.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What's the difference?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> \"What's the difference\"?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Here we go.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it's directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows, there and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion. I could go on, but I think I've made my point.</p>", "253": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Wait till you see this.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's fantastic. Unbelievable!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> See what?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> This isn't a good time.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy computer voice.</p>", "254": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aw, screw the roommate agreement!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, you don't screw the roommate agreement. The roommate agreement screws you.<br/></p>", "255": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't care for novelty editions of Monopoly. I prefer the classics: regular and Klingon.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Actually, Indian Monopoly is just like regular. Except the money is in rupees and instead of hotels, you build call centers. And when you pick a chance card, you might die of dysentery. Just FYI, that was racist.</p>", "256": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Here's an interesting fact about alcohol: Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. Can you guess what the other is? Hint: sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Monkeys.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When does a monkey have a trunk?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> When a suitcase just won't do.</p>", "257": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am aware of the way humans usually reproduce which is messy, unsanitary and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, God.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, exactly.</p>", "258": "<p><strong>Raj</strong>: Ooo, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.</p>", "259": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> But excuse me, I have something to say. None of you may realize it, but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days -- the four of us hanging out, playing video games, before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it's like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday, I'll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!</p>", "260": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Black beans, not pinto beans? <br> <strong>Sheldon</strong>: Yes. <br> <strong>Leonard</strong>: Double guacamole? <br> <strong>Sheldon</strong>: Of course. <br><strong>Leonard</strong>: Lettuce shredded, not chopped? <br> <strong>Sheldon</strong>: Yes. <br><strong>Leonard</strong>: No cilantro? <br> <strong>Sheldon</strong>: Nope. <br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: You understand why I'm doing this to you? <br/> <strong>Sheldon</strong>: I do. <br/> <strong>Leonard</strong>: That will be all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>", "261": "<p><strong>Penny</strong>: I give up. He's impossible.<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I can't be impossible; I exist. I think what you meant to say is, 'I give up; he's improbable'.</p>", "262": "<p><strong>Hooker</strong>: What's your name? <br/><strong>Raj</strong>: Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.<br/><strong>Hooker</strong>: Hello Rajesh Ram...Hello Rajesh.</p>", "263": "<p><strong>Rajesh:</strong> Why so glum, chum?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Apparently you can't hack into a government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the Department of Homeland Security tattling to your mother.</p>", "264": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Stop it both of you! All this fighting, I might as well be back with my parents!\n<br/>\n*Imitating his Mom* <i>Dammit, George!  I told you if you didn't quit drinking I would leave you!</i><br/>\n*Imitating his Dad* <i>Well, I guess that makes you a liar, because I'm drunk as hell and you are still here!</i><br/>\n*Imitating his Mom* <i>Stop yelling, you're making Sheldon cry!</i><br/>\n*Imitating his Dad* <i>I'll tell you what is making Sheldon cry, that I let you name him SHELDON!</i></p>", "265": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I would have been here sooner but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it.</p>", "266": "<p><strong>Wolowitz</strong>: Sex is never the way I dreamed it was going to be.<br><strong>Raj</strong>: Because in your dreams, you're a horse from the waist down.</br></p>", "267": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Relax, it's just a dirty sock.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How on earth can you say \"dirty sock\" and \"relax\" in the same sentence?</p>", "268": "<p><strong>Girl</strong>: What are you gonna get, Raj?\n<br/><strong>Raj</strong>: With my luck, hepatitis.\n</p>", "269": "<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Wait. Wait, Sheldon come back, you forgot something.\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: What?\n<br><strong>Penny</strong>: This plasma grenade. Ha! Look, it's raining you!</br></br></p>", "270": "<p><strong>Rajesh</strong>: Missy.  Do you enjoy pajamas?\n<br><strong>Missy</strong>: I guess.\n<br/><strong>Rajesh</strong>: Yes, well, we Indians invented them. You're welcome.\n<br/><strong>Howard</strong>: Yeah, well my people invented circumcision. You're welcome.</br></p>", "271": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Whats Sheldon's deal? Is it girls, guys, sock puppets?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We operate on the assumption that Sheldon has no deal. Though we have many theories about how he might reproduce. I'm an advocate of mitosis.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I believe that one day Sheldon will eat an enormous amount of Thai food and spilt into two Sheldons. </p>", "272": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. You manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre. What do you do?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I say, \"Hey Ma, what's for dinner?\"<br/></p>", "273": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Is that the laser? It's bitchin'.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper \"Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung\", his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin'.<br><strong>Zack:</strong> Well, mission accomplished! </br></p>", "274": "<p><b>Sheldon</b>: I'm sorry, coffee's out of the question. When I moved to California I promised my mother that I wouldn't start doing drugs.</p>", "275": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I often forget other people have limitations. It's so sad. <br> <strong>Howard</strong>: He can feel sadness? <br> <strong>Leonard</strong>: Not really. It's what you and I would call condescension.</br></br></p>", "276": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Are you planning on kidnapping a woman?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sarcasm?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes, but mixed with genuine concern.</p>", "277": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A neutron walks into a bar and asks how much for a drink. The bartender replies \"for you, no charge\".</p>", "278": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, can we just forget about this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Alright. Leonard is attempting to learn why subatomic particles move the way they do.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? That's it? Well, that doesn't sound so complicated.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not. That's why Leonard does it.</br></br></p>", "279": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, all I'm giving you is the napkin, Sheldon.</p>", "280": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Leonard, you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion.<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: You really think so?<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Of course not. Even in my sleep-deprived state, I've managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks. Bazinga!</p>", "281": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You shot your spit in my mouth!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Is that gonna be on the test? Because I don't think I can do that again.</p>", "282": "<p><strong>Raj</strong>: With your American accent, everything you say sounds stupid.</p>", "283": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Wait, put this in the bathroom.\n<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: What for?\n<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren't shutting down.\n<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: I mix pancake batter in this!\n<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: No, that measuring cup has always been for urine.\n<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn't have ten seconds to make a label that said \"urine cup\"?\n<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: It's right here on the bottom.\n<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: Huh, I guess I owe the Betty Crocker Company a letter of apology.</p>", "284": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Mrs. Cooper? Hey, it's Penny. I think I broke your son. Hold on. Talk to your mother.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Crying) Mommy, I love you. Don't let Spock take me to the future!</p>", "285": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, that was beautiful.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you didn't press record-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I pressed it!</br></p>", "286": "<p><strong>Priya:</strong> What happened?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howard's mother had a heart attack because I have sex with him and she can't.</p>", "287": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon, that's my water.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, dear Lord!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's not your water.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I know.</p>", "288": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> 1. I lost my virginity to my cousin, Jeanie. 2. It was my Uncle Murray's funeral, we were all back at my Aunt Barbara's house. Our eyes locked over the pickled herring. We never meant for it to happen. 3. To this day, I can't look at pickled herring without being aroused and ashamed. Oh, cousin Jeanie.</p>", "289": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me, Penny, but-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't tell her.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We're playing Klingon Boggle.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aww!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What do you mean \"Aww?\" Like she didn't know we were nerds?</p>", "290": "<p><strong>Penny</strong>: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.\n</br></p>", "291": "<p><strong>Howard</strong>: Sheldon knows football? I mean Quidditch, sure, but football?</p>", "292": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Howard, you know me to be a very smart man. Don't you think that if I were wrong, I'd know it?</p>", "293": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, in difficult moments like this, I often turn to a force greater than myself.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Religion?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Star Trek.</p>", "294": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Penny. I know you think you're being generous, but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. You haven't given me a gift, you've given me an obligation.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't feel bad, Penny, it's a classic rookie mistake. My first Hanukkah with Sheldon, he yelled at me for eight nights.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Now, honey, it's okay. You don't have to get me anything in return.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course I do. The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you've given me. It's no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, you know what? Forget it. I'm not giving you a present.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, it's too late. I see it. That elf sticker says to Sheldon. The die has been cast, the moving finger has writ, Hannibal has crossed the Alps.</br></br></br></br></br></p>", "295": "<p><strong>Raj</strong>: How can I be a gynaecologist? I can barely look a woman in the eye!</p>", "296": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You gotta help me get my arm into my sleeve.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Eyes closed) Okay!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Is that my arm?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It doesn't feel like an arm.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Then maybe you should let it go.</p>", "297": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Why do you have the Chinese character for 'soup' tattooed on your right buttock?<br><strong>Penny</strong>: It's not 'soup'; it's 'courage'.<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: No it isn't. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup.<br><strong>Penny</strong>: How'd you see it? You said you wouldn't look.<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks.</br></br></br></br></p>", "298": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker.</p>", "299": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Good Morning your honor, Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se - that is to say representing himself. <br><strong>Judge</strong>: I know what it means, I went to law school. <br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Yet you wound up in traffic court.</br></br></p>", "300": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So you're saying if I became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldn't sign a pre-nup?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Absolutely not! If I'm gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you're on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling, then Leonard gots to get paid.<br/></p>", "301": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For the record, I do have genitals. They're functional and aesthetically pleasing.</p>", "302": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, well, well, if it isn't Wil Wheaton. The Green Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul V to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my Firefox!</p>", "303": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I am uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny. <br> <strong>Leonard</strong>: What was I supposed to say? <br> <strong>Sheldon</strong>: You could have told her the truth. <br> <strong>Leonard</strong>: I could not have said that, it would have hurt her feelings. <br/> <strong>Sheldon</strong>: Is that a relevant factor? <br/> <strong>Leonard</strong>: Yes. <br/> <strong>Sheldon</strong>: Then I suppose you could have agreed to go. <br/> <strong>Leonard</strong>: What would I have said afterwards? <br/> <strong>Sheldon</strong>: I would suggest something along the lines of \"singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree, I recommend you do a CAT scan to locate the tumor which is pressing on the cognitive processing center of your brain\".</br></br></br></p>", "304": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Cause of Injury: Lack of Adhesive Ducks.</p>", "305": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You work in pharmaceuticals. Don't you have anything you can give him?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> All I have is our new urine flow drug. Won't help with his anxiety, but it's so strong, when he pees he'll fly around the room like he's got a jet pack.</p>", "306": "<p><strong>Mike:</strong> I know I'm hard on you, but you're not the worst son-in-law in the world.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Mike, that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.<br/><strong>Mike:</strong> Well, I'm drunk.</p>", "307": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> If you guys were hungry, why didn't you order something at the restaurant?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We did. You never brought it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's right. Nachos and a turkey club.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Not even close.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your ...

And please don't say a white one.</p>", "310": "<p><strong><strong>Wolowitz:</strong></strong> Puppies, how do you stand on puppies?<br/><strong>Bernadette</strong>: A puppy once bit my face!<br/><strong><strong>Wolowitz:</strong></strong> Of course it did.</p>", "311": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> A guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door. I wish I could tell thirteen-year-old me it does get better.</p>", "312": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>:  Is my hamburger medium-well?\n<br><strong>Leonard</strong>:  Yes.\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>:  Dill slices not sweet?\n<br><strong>Leonard</strong>:  Yes.\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>:  Individual relish packets?\n<br/><b>Leonard</b>:  Yes.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>:  Onion rings?\n<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>:  Yes.\n<br/><b>Sheldon</b>:  Extra-breading?\n<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>:  I asked.\n<br/><b>Sheldon</b>:  What did they say?\n<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>:  No.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>:  Did you protest?\n<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>:  Yes.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>:  Vociferously?\n<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>:  No.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>:  Well then what took you so long?            </br></br></br></br></p>", "313": "<p><strong>Priya:</strong> Indian parents are very protective of their children.\n<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Right. Whereas Jewish mothers take a casual la-di-da approach to their sons.</p>", "314": "<p><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> But you love that spot.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I love my mother. My feelings for my spot are much greater.</p>", "315": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> *After just being jailed, at the biggest guy in the cell who's sitting on a bench* That's my spot.</p>", "316": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Are you upset about something?\n<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: What was your first clue?\n<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Well, it was a number of things. First, the late hour, then you demeanor seems very low energy, plus your irritability.\n<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: Yes, I'm upset!\n<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Oh. I don't usually pick up on those things. Good for me.\n<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: Yeah, good for you.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: (walks away and then turns back) Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about what's bothering you?\n<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: I don't know. Maybe.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Wow! I'm on fire tonight.            </br></p>", "317": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> No Shoes, No Shirt, No Sheldon.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena!</p>", "318": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Great news. A raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier and can now infect humans.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Why is that great news?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> In the pharmaceutical business we have a saying: mo' infections, mo' money.</br></p>", "319": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Besides, Penny and I are having a girl's night tonight.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Girls night, what does that entail?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh you know, girls get together hang out share girl talk.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm a girl.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh well maybe you could join us. I'll ask Penny.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No need, Penny and I are very close.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You are? <br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes, In fact our mensies are synchronized.<br/></p>", "320": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not really!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters, most people will trip.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't care. 2 millime--? That doesn't seem right.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father broke his clavicle.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is that why they sent you to boarding school?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. That was the result of my work with lasers.</p>", "321": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> When Winnie-the-Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You do what you want, I'm not touching another man's honey tree.</p>", "322": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles, we live at 311 Los Robles. *Holds up number 2 fixture*\n<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> You changed the address on the building?

It's the same guy I've been going out with for the past two years. Yeah, the scientist. Well, it's complicated. He works with lasers and atomic magnets. No, I did not see it coming.

Yeah, this is a first for our family.</p>", "326": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're talking like a crazy person.<br/><strong>Mary:</strong> Actually, I had him tested as a child.

I touched you!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Happy Valentine's Day.</p>", "328": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I still don't see why I need a driver's license.

It's a wonder neither of us has been hurt!<br/><strong>Amy's Mum:</strong> Amy? What is he saying?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You wanted me to have a boyfriend, mother, well here he is!

I assume since the rest of you have set the bar so low, you're saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go on Howard, dazzle me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, my power is the ability to pretend like I give a damn about your piddly-ass problem. And that's 24/7 buddy.</p>", "338": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behavior. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled onto that.</p>", "339": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Penny.\n<br><strong>Penny</strong>: Yeah.\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Thanks for letting me stay here.\n<br><strong>Penny</strong>: Oh, you're welcome sweetie.\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Okay, I'm sleepy now get out.\n</br></br></br></br></p>", "340": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The conductor said if I come back to the engine room, he'd show me how to take the train through a crossing.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay.

I do!</br></br></p>", "341": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Dance number aside, I'm so not gay.</p>", "342": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?<br/><strong>Penny</strong>: Because I like peppermint, and it's fun to say schnapps!</p>", "343": "<p><strong><strong>Sheldon:</strong></strong> Penny, while I subscribe to the \"Many Worlds\" theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you fun in any of them?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The math would suggest that in a few I'm a clown made of candy. But I don't dance.</p>", "344": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, she's free to examine my briefs.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Howard!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I know! I'm disgusting.

I mean, why can't there be food on it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I knew she wasn't lead car material.</p>", "352": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.\n<br><strong>Penny</strong>: I could think about you.\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Whatever works.\n</br></br></p>", "353": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: She calls me moon-pie because I'm nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up.</p>", "354": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hi, Sheldon.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you feeling any better?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Physically, yes, but I'm upset because everyone's mad at me for no good reason.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why don't you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, I'll explain to you why you're wrong.</br></br></br></p>", "355": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Why isn't it ever Angie Dickinson's bedroom?</p>", "356": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So, you're really going out with Dave again?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why not? He's actually a very nice guy.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> But he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves Sheldon.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's nothing Sheldon hasn't done before.</p>", "357": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Let's see. I have been on six dates with three different people. It was either for coffee or dinner. One I met at a bookstore and two I met online. I haven't slept with anyone. The aquarium is 40 minutes away. And there's a baggie of Cheerios for you in the glove compartment.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, regular or honey nut?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I mixed them.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You mixed them. No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door.</p>", "358": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> If you don't want to use dating Web sites, what do you suggest?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Off the top of my head? Prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains, she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory, and then sits quietly by my side while I watch Daredevil.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You seriously think women would fight for you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> People compete for jobs and trophies, why not me?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> He's right. He knows a lot of jokes.</p>", "359": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Uh, well, actually, to be honest I haven't told her yet.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You've been giving me a hard time and you haven't even told your mom about Sheldon?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss. I don't know what you're talking about.</p>", "360": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> How old is this Jell-O? <br><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, it's carrots, so I'm gonna say very.</br></p>", "361": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Well, I would have to say when he was thirteen and he tried to build a nuclear reaction in the tool shed.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ooh, this is a good one.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Now, the first thing you need to know about Shelly is, ever since he was a little boy, he was always concerned with the well-being of others. And he didn't think it was fair for people to pay for electricity, so he was gonna power the entire town for free.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium!<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh, well! Well, this is adorable. When he arranged to get some yellow-cake from Chad, I thought he was talking about twinkies from one of his friends.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah. But I wasn't, because I didn't have any friends.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> No. It turns out this little scallywag was trying to use my Visa card to buy uranium from an African warlord in the country of Chad.</p>", "362": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game. <br/><strong>Josh:</strong> Wow. <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> He did it with a robot. <br/><strong>Josh:</strong> You had sex with a robot? <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's not what she meant. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> But technically, yes.</p>", "363": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Have you made a decision about the TARDIS? I think I can sell it if we call it Big British Portapotty.</p>", "364": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We cover ourselves in body paint and then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Woah, that's kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off.</p>", "365": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> The place really looks great.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, you should have burnt it down years ago.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I keep telling you, I didn't burn it down.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We know. We know. Because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime. *wink*</p>", "366": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Why are there tears?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Everything's fine. We just started talking about living arrangements.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you crazy? You know he's a flight risk!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's exactly what I told him.</p>", "367": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> What are you talking about? There's nothing weird going on between me and your mother.<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz (o.s.):</strong> Stewie, your bath is getting cold!</p>", "368": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howard, get off of him.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Not until he stops humping his way up my family tree.</p>", "369": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You locked them in your basement?<br/><strong>Dr. Lorvis:</strong> Well, they're not locked in. The door just sticks.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, so how do they unstick it?<br/><strong>Dr. Lorvis:</strong> They'd need the key.</p>", "370": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sorry, I'm late. The leaf blower broke so I had to hand dry my mother-in-law.</p>", "371": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hang on, I know a place where you could you stay and earn some money at the same time.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Great!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I just have to warn you: it will involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> So, what's the catch?</p>", "372": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, the movie's not as bad as you thought?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, it is. But I decided instead of complaining about it, I'm going to go in every day and give it my all.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Good for you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thanks. There's no reason why I shouldn't be the best bi-sexual, go-go dancer, slowly transforming into a killer gorilla, anyone's ever seen.</p>", "373": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> After two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> A mocha?! Well, it must be nice to be Queen.</p>", "374": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well then why are you doing it?<br/><strong>Mary:</strong> Because I'm not perfect, Shelly. And that man's booty is.</p>", "375": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't know what made me think tonight would be any different.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well just the fact you got him up here says a lot. To be honest, I bet Howie $200 that it wasn't going to happen.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm going to the Lego Store to get a big-ass R2D2.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> See, it's not just Sheldon, they're all idiots.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She's right.</br></p>", "376": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I just got a part on a TV show.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Congratulations!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's great. Guys ...<br/><strong>The guys:</strong> Yeah ...<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What's the show?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> NC - I I? or, you know, NC - S T D. I don't know. It's the one with all the letters.</p>", "377": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> See, just now you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could do that with me but not with Raj?<br/><strong>Lucy:</strong> I don't know your email.</p>", "378": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> The man impersonating a bear would like you to know that \"Only you can prevent forest fires.\"<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't get it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You didn't have Smokey the Bear in India?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No. Was he anything like Munmun the Mongoose? He taught us not to play with cobras.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You had to be taught not to play with cobras?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You had to be taught not to burn down the forest?</p>", "379": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you sure your moth-like personality won't be drawn to this blazing fire that is myself?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> More and more sure.</p>", "380": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You can't just throw everything in the closet.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, you can tell me what to do and how to do it, but not both at the same time. This isn't sex.</p>", "381": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> You're right. Who am I kidding? You should have seen me when I was young, Sheldon. The fellas used to line up and bring me boxes of candy. Why did I eat it all? Will you hold me?</p>", "382": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, what fresh hell is this?<br/><strong>Biosuit Nurse:</strong> Wait, you can't leave here, you've been exposed.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Covering his face with his shirt) No, I haven't. It's all good.</p>", "383": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong>He'll be back.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (Through the door) Of course, I'll be back, I live here!</p>", "384": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mmm, this is good. Whatever this is.</p>", "385": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't be oversensitive. He's calling <em>you</em> illiterate, not your race.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, okay. Good.</p>", "386": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, help me out here. How does an archaeology professor get that good with a whip?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore. That's how I learned.</p>", "387": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> OK Sheldon, what can I get ya?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Alcohol.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Could you be a little more specific?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ethyl alcohol, 40 millilitres.</p>", "388": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You did this, didn't you?<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton</strong>: Come on, Sheldon, do you really think I'd break up a couple just to win a bowling game?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I suppose not.<br/><strong>Wheaton</strong>: Good. Keep thinking that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wheeeeatoooon!</p>", "389": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What was that?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon tried to steal the ring so I punched him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's my girl!</p>", "390": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Come here, tushie face.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Tushie face! That is going on twitter right now.</br></p>", "391": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I think I'm starting to get this.<br/><strong>Rajesh:</strong> Really? The only thing I've learnt in the last 2 hours is that American men drink a lot of beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Focus on the game, not the commercials Raj.</p>", "392": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> That's right. Go back to Babylon, you whore!</p>", "393": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> You don't hunt, do you?</p>", "394": "<p><strong>Store Clerk:</strong> Excuse me, Sir, you don't work here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, well apparently neither does anyone else.</p>", "395": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay make your little jokes, but out of the four of us, I'm the only one who's making real world contribution to science and technology.<br/><strong>Rajesh:</strong> He's right, this is an important achievement for two reasons. Number one and of course number two!\n</p>", "396": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hope you don't mind, I told my girlfriend, Bernadette, she can join us for dinner.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure, the more the merrier.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, no. That's a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there was 2000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, we'd be suffocating.</br></br></p>", "397": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: What exactly does that expression mean, 'friends with benefits?' Does he provide her with health insurance?</p>", "398": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard, and Howard, and Raj, they aren't like other guys. They're special.<br/><strong>Alicia:</strong> Okay, they're special, and?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Well let's see how can I explain this. Um. They don't know how to use their shields.<br/><strong>Alicia:</strong> Shields?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. You know like in Star Trek and you're in battle, and you raise the shields.<br/>\n*Realizing what she said* Where the hell did that come from?</br></p>", "399": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.\n<br>\n*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*\n<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What do you think their combined IQ is ? </br></p>", "400": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In Papua New Guinea, there's a tribe when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village, they kill him and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense, of course, but one can see their point. </p>", "401": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So you're saying, if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her right there, right now, you'll just walk away?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I said I'm her friend, not her gay friend.</p>", "402": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Under normal circumstances I'd say I told you so. But, as I have told you so with such vehemence and frequency already the phrase has lost all meaning.  Therefore, I will be replacing it with the phrase, I have informed you thusly.</p>", "403": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, Sheldon, did you change your Wi-Fi password again?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, it's \"Penny get your own Wi-Fi\"; no spaces.</p>", "404": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Wow, so you guys are like buds now?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, yeah, we hang out all the time.<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> Plus, he doesn't have a girlfriend, I don't have a girlfriend.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> It's like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other's holes.<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> That sounds a little funny to an American ear.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Which part?<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> Just all of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>", "405": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> We're looking for Sheldon, not Marmaduke.</p>", "406": "<p><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> I think that you and Penny had a poor night.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It wasn't poor. It was ... just fine.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Dude, the fourth Harry Potter movie was just fine.</p>", "407": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.</p>", "408": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You call that a glow stick? *Pulls out a Lightsaber* That is a glow stick!</p>", "409": "<p><strong><strong>Sheldon:</strong></strong> I am the ball, my thoughts are its thoughts, its holes are my holes.</p>", "410": "<p><strong>Raj</strong>: I'm going to be deported. Sent home in disgrace. Exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin Sanjay or, as you may know him, Dave from AT&amp;T customer service.</p>", "411": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not Sheldon.  I'm the Flash.  And now I'm going to the Grand Canyon to scream in frustration *takes two quick steps* I'm back</p>", "412": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's a dogapus?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A hybrid dog and octopus. Man's underwater best friend.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> There's someone working on that?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself for my 300th birthday.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait a minute you hate dogs.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls; no one can hate that.</br></br></br></p>", "413": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> She's only been here a day and a half, and I'm seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.\n<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday, and I've been half bombed ever since.\n</p>", "414": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good morning everyone and welcome to \"Science and Society\". I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, BS, MS, MA, PhD and ScD. OMG, right?</p>", "415": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?</p>", "416": "<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Yes, I know men can't fly. <br> <strong>Sheldon</strong>: No, no let's assume that they can.  Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.\n<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Unless Superman matches her speed and decelerates.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In what space, sir, in what space? She's two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he'd let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death.</br></p>", "417": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'd like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, Weisskopf.<br/><strong>Mary:</strong> Yeah, I get it. You got a lot of cats, and you gave 'em cute Jewish names.</p>", "418": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen, supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account.</br></p>", "419": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter</strong>: So, Howard, have you and Rajesh finally summoned the courage to express your latent homosexual feelings towards one another?</p>", "420": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, guys. What'd I miss, what'd I miss?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Giselle's hanging by a thread.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, good, I hate her.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Then you're not invited to our wedding.</p>", "421": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sorry.<br/><strong>Raj's sister:</strong> Why do you say that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> When I'm in bed with a girl, that's just my natural response.</p>", "422": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you think we can outrun him?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you.</br></p>", "423": "<p><b>Sheldon: </b> Oh Mario, if only I could control everyone the way I control you. Hop, you little plumber. Hop, hop hop!</p>", "424": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE steak!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.</p>", "425": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong>: Howard it's the phone!<br/><strong>Howard</strong>: I know it's the phone ma! I hear the phone!<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong>: Who is calling at this ungodly hour?<br/><strong>Howard</strong>: I don't know!<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong>: Well ask them why are they calling at this ungodly hour!<br/><strong>Howard</strong>: How can I ask them when I'm talking to you?</p>", "426": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What the hell's going on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You hypocrite.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Little Miss Grown-Ups-Don't-Play-With-Toys! If I went into that apartment right now, would I not find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello, Hello Kitty!</p>", "427": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, you do this all the time!  You fixate on some crazy idea then blow it way out of proportion.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Name one time I've ever done that.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> How about the time you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you thought North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you thought were human nuggets. The mysterious cloud that was following you around town. Or the time you put my shirt on by accident and thought you were growing again.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I said name one. You need to work on your listening skills.</br></br></br></p>", "428": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Can you believe it! He watched me work for 10 minutes and than he tried to build a little piece of software that could replace me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is that really possible?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> As it turned out, yes.</p>", "429": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah, memory impairment; the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle.</p>", "430": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?\n<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating  you to go back and knock me unconscious.\n<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What if I knock you unconscious now?\n<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It won't change the past.\n<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But it'd make the present so much nicer.\n</p>", "431": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I present to you the Relationship Agreement.  A binding covenant that in its 31 pages enumerates, illuminates and codifies the responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper - hereinafter referred to as the \"Boyfriend\" - and Amy Farrah Fowler - hereinafter referred to as the \"Girlfriend.\n<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's so romantic!\n<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mutual indemnification always is.</p>", "432": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> You're inferring I'm stupid.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's not correct. We implied you're stupid, you then inferred it.</br></p>", "433": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know what'd be nice? Name it after your girlfriends. Show them how much you care.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> That is a great idea.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's perfect. It appears romantic, but it's really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine's Day forever.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> So, uh, what were you thinking? Combine their names?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I like it. Yeah, we'll take the \"Am\" from Amy and, uh, the \"Y\" from Emily.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> That's just Amy.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Exactly. See how well we work together?</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>", "434": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, what's wrong?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I wanted to let you know I'll be spending your birthday with you.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> See, I had tickets to the Star Wars premiere that night, but Professor Proton came to me in a dream, dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi, and convinced me that I should be with you.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Obi-what?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll let you get back to sleep now. Good night.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Good night. Uh, Sheldon, were you actually not going to spend my birthday with me?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (feigning sleepiness) It's late, gotta go, bye.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>", "435": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You got me something?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Not just something. It's from the heart, it's holiday-themed, and I swallowed the gift receipt so you can not return it.</br></p>", "436": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> (To Raj's dog) Bark once if you need me to call PETA.</p>", "437": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why are they staring?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Who cares? Just soak it in. Hello, boys.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, hey.\n(To the other customers) Could you please stop staring? They're just girls. It's nothing you haven't seen in movies or in drawings.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, Stuart.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> What brings you guys here?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We were looking for a recommendation about comic books.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, well, I recommend you don't open a store and sell them.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much, so we thought wed give it a try.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, okay. What do you think you might be into? Superhero, fantasy, graphic novels, manga? \n(To the customers) I swear I will turn a hose on you.</p>", "438": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Honey, have you ever run before?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Certainly. I've run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens and one particularly persistent PE teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.<br/></p>", "439": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You can't make a half sandwich.  If it's not half of a whole sandwich, it's just a small sandwich.</p>", "440": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What are they doing here?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We came to apologize again and bring you home. So why don't you pack up your stuff, and we'll head back?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, this is my home now. Thanks to you, my career is over, and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists.<br/><strong>Mrs. Cooper</strong>: You watch your mouth, Shelly. Everyone's entitled to their opinion.<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: But evolution is not opinion, it's a fact.\n<br><strong>Sheldon's mom</strong>: And that is your opinion.\n</br></br></p>", "441": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't seem to get in touch with Amy. I tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her, posting on her Facebook wall,texting her, nothing. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did you try calling her on the telephone?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The telephone. You know, Leonard, in your own simple way, you may be the wisest of us all.<br/></p>", "442": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> They're gonna get beaten up at that club.<br><strong><strong>Penny:</strong></strong> They're gonna get beaten up at Walgreens.</br></p>", "443": "<p><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Well no, you're mistaken. You give speeches all the time. What you can't do is shut up.</p>", "444": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her, and now look. We're going to be late for the movies.</p>", "445": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What are we gonna do?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We? No, no, no. You had your chance to be \"we\" for like a year and a half now. Right now, you are you and you are screwed!<br/></p>", "446": "<p><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> The way I see it, I'm halfway to pity sex.</p>", "447": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know it just occurred to me, if there are an infinite number of parallel universes, in one of them there's probably a Sheldon who doesn't believe parallel universes exist.\n<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Probably. What's your point?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No point.  It's just one of those things that makes one of the me's chuckle.</br></p>", "448": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know Amy, when we say we're having girl talk, it doesn't mean that we just have to talk about our ladyparts.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> That's a shame. I had a real zinger about my tilted uterus.</br></p>", "449": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Have you considered telling her how you feel? <br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, I'm a physicist, not a hippie.</br></p>", "450": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, did you have a Christmas tree? <br> <strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighborhood-wise seizures.</br></p>", "451": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?\n<br/><strong>Wolowitz</strong>: Every year at ComiCon.  Every day at Disneyland.  You can hire Snow White to come to your house.  Of course they prefer if you have a kid.\n</p>", "452": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Typing into a search engine) How do I get 12-year-old schoolgirls excited?<br/><strong>Howard and Leonard:</strong> No!</p>", "453": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: There once was a brave lad named Leonard.\n<br/>\nWith a fi fi fiddle dee dee.\n<br/>\nHe faced a fearsome giant.\n<br/>\nWhile Raj just wanted to pee.</p>", "454": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When you understand the laws of physics, Penny, anything is possible.

I told Amy that in the strictest of confidence. Boy some people are such blabbermouths. Well whatever, I'm sure Bernadette can do better.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selected mutism and alcohol issues is better than a 100lb Jewish guy who lives with his mom?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> You are kidding! Raj likes Bernadette?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> I didn't say Raj, who said Raj?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay give, how do you know? Did he tell you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well then who?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can't say<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Priya told you, oh what a little gossip. Ya know, not an attractive quality in a woman Leonard. Not judging, just my opinion.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well the point is if this got out it would destroy Howard and Raj's friendship.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You don't have to worry, unlike Amy and Priya, I know how to keep a secret.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're the one who told Amy in the first place.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> In confidence.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>", "462": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There was a tall man from Cornwall<br/>\nWhose length exceeded his bed.<br/>\n\"My body fits on it.<br/>\nBut barely upon it.<br/>\nThere's no room for my big Cornish head!\"</p>", "463": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wow, Penny, you're on fire!<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, so is Sheldon!</br></p>", "464": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm the guy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're not the guy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you sure? It would explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment. That baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me. The way you call me sweetie all the time.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I call everyone sweetie.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You tramp.<br/></p>", "465": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I'm a mammal.<br/></br></p>", "466": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, I know what you're doing.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really?\n<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, you're using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behavior.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Very good. Chocolate?\n<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: No, I don't want any chocolate! Sheldon, you can't train my girlfriend like a lab rat.<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Actually, it turns out I can.</p>", "467": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you saying that Amy is, oh, what's the scientific word-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Forget science: she's horny.</p>", "468": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on, Amy, show us the dress.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, but I'm really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, I don't think any of your comfort zones are showing.</p>", "469": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I've seen and talked to you more in the two days we've been broken up than in the last two months we were together.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again.</p>", "470": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, buddy, can we have some privacy?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course. Wouldn't want to intrude. (takes red bra out of his pocket and hands it to Penny) This is yours.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, when I'm done with him, I'm gonna need more information.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nothing odd. I just wanted to rub Amy's nose in it.</p>", "471": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, I don't think she's wrong about you going too slow in the relationship.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Too slow? <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, you've been going out for years. You haven't even slept together.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's right. It's called foreplay.</p>", "472": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself. I always had to earn it. <br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh, Leonard, I'm sure she loves you very much. In her own cold godless way.</p>", "473": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> At least the bearded man I believe in preaches love and compassion.

A good Christian would have turned the other cheek. On the other hand, a good Texan would have shot her, so I'll just split the difference.</p>", "475": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you want to say it?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Let's say it together.<br/><strong>Sheldon and <strong>Amy:</strong></strong> We're getting a turtle!</p>", "476": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> That would be great. I'd love for things between me and mom to get back to normal.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, normal's a strong word, but sure.</p>", "477": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There are post-prom mating rituals?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Not always. Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress, then always.</p>", "478": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are they making fun of us?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yep.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I miss the old days when I couldn't tell.</p>", "479": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny is not the reason I did not pursue that idea.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh really? Since meeting her, what have been your greatest accomplishments?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Easy. Sleeping with Penny.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Tricking Penny into getting engaged.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And a few weeks ago he almost did a pull-up!</p>", "480": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I know. This might help. *Gets a ring out of his wallet*<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Where did you get a ring?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I've had it for a couple of years. Not important.</br></p>", "481": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I get it. Like C-3PO. ... What happened to me?</p>", "482": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm not sure it's a good idea to take Penny to where wine comes from.</p>", "483": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, that's okay. I can fight my own battles. Isn't that right, Bawwy?<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Is that a reference to my speech impediment? That's pretty hurtful. I can't control it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're right. That was uncalled for. I take it back.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Of course you do, because you're The Retractor!</p>", "484": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (To Amy) Do you have any idea what it's like to wait for years and never know if you're finally going to get satisfaction?</p>", "485": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Are they actually arguing about comic books?\n<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, that can't be right.\n<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe \"Thor's Hammer\" is a new color of nail polish.\n</p>", "486": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You may not realize it, but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want. It's exhausting!</p>", "487": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> 'He drank from Leonard`s glass' - the words they will be carving into my tombstone.</p>", "488": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I must say, Amy, pretending to have intercourse with you has given me a great deal of satisfaction.</p>", "489": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Good morning, slut!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, please! I recognise the walk of shame when I see it. All you're missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it!</p>", "490": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Hey, Cooper. I hear you're going to be on the radio with Ira Flatow from Science Friday next week.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends.<br><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> My pleasure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My thanks were not sincere.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Ah, but my pleasure is.</br></br></p>", "491": "<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Don't you dare knock!</p>", "492": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton</strong>: Did that guy just say \"Revenge is a dish best served cold\" to me in Klingon?</p>", "493": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What's the matter, you chicken?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not by nature at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbor's chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Chickens can't climb trees.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank God.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, I believe the chicken made you his bitch.</p>", "494": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, this is very pleasant.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And you said there would never be enough pasta for the three of us.</p>", "495": "<p><strong>DMV Worker:</strong> Here's your learner's permit. Go away.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I'm not done. I have many additional concerns about these questions.<br/><strong>DMV Worker:</strong> Don't make me climb over this counter!</p>", "496": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, you can't re-program people.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, <em>you</em> can't re-program people.</p>", "497": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?</p>", "498": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Don't you think if a woman was living with me I'd be the first one to know about it? <br> <strong>Penny</strong>: Oh, sweetie, you'd be the last one to know about it.</br></p>", "499": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh great it's my cousin David about the ring. Hey David what'd you find? Sure half a carat is fine. Her freakishly small hands make anything look big. It's one of the reasons I love her.</p>", "500": "<p><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> You got her to have sex with you.  Obviously your super power is brainwashing.\n</p>", "501": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Hello Penny. I realize you are currently in the mercy of your primitive biological urges. But, as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?</p>", "502": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A fear of heights is illogical. A fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary.</p>", "503": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> How's your life?\n<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Like everybody else's, subject to entropy, decay and eventual death. Thank you for asking.</br></p>", "504": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> If Sheldon proposed to me during sex, my ovaries would grab onto him and never let go.</p>", "505": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, could I ask you a question?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I would prefer that you not, but I wouldn't go so far as to forbid it. </br></p>", "506": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male and she's a female.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, but not of the same species.</br></p>", "507": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll get the blankets, you Google how to have child-like fun.</p>", "508": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Women, you can't live with them. You can't successfully refute their hypotheses.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amen to that. </p>", "509": "<p>(Sheldon notices Penny taking Leonard to his bedroom)<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's going on?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Get your noise-cancelling headphones, 'cause it's gonna get loud.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, not this again.</p>", "510": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you're on your back.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard doesn't snore.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I wasn't talking to Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard (to Penny):</strong> Told ya.</p>", "511": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can I have a napkin.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, no!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But you have a whole bunch of napkins.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, I've moved to a four napkin system, lap, hands, face, and personal emergency. If you like, starting tomorrow, I'll add a guest napkin but I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for you today.<br/>\n*Leonard grabs a napkin.*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good luck, that's the face napkin.</p>", "512": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you don't mind, I'd like to stop listening to you and start talking.</p>", "513": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There there, everything is going to be fine... Sheldon's here!</p>", "514": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You'll never guess what just happened.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You went out into the hallway, stumbled into an inter-dimensional portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, which you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you're back to bring us all with you to the year 7010, where we transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled dolphins.</p>", "515": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I know your present is for us to be intimate tonight.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I see. Is that all right?<br>\n(Amy kisses Sheldon)<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, but this is a litigious society. I'm going to need verbal consent.\n<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes!</br></br></br></br></p>", "516": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Are you listening to yourself?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I always listen to myself. It's one of the great joys of my life.</br></p>", "517": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Gotta run. (Looks down at scissors) But not with scissors, that would be unsafe.</p>", "518": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes, dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Which brings me to our next order of business. (Kisses him)<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fascinating.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I hope you don't take what I'm about to do as a comment on what we just did. (Runs to bathroom and vomits)</p>", "519": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hi, Mom, how are you?But, Mom, she keeps sitting in my spot. And she touched my food. Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it. (throwing a fit) No, that's not fair. Why should I have to apologize? I really don't think this is the kind of thing Jesus concerns himself with. No, you're right. I don't really know what Jesus thinks about. All right! Goodbye. (hangs up) (to Leonard) Did you tell on me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you kidding me? I already have 2 strikes</p>", "520": "<p><strong>Sheldon: </strong> There's a fine line between wrong and visionary.

At 73 degrees, I'm there already!<br/></p>", "529": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know mother, but you're not fooling me. Every time you want to talk it means you want me listen.<br/><strong>Mrs. Cooper:</strong> Then stop talking.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, Ma'am.</p>", "530": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't worry. I will remain the same down to earth, humble Joe I've always been.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Good to know.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now give me that cookie, I discovered an element.</br></br></p>", "531": "<p><strong>Rajesh</strong>: Excuse me but I don't think Penny is out of line at all. You don't own her. It's like my girl Beyonce says: If you like it you should've put a ring on it.</p>", "532": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with Alzheimer's had that episode?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.</p>", "533": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: You know, I'm given to understand that there's an entire city in Nevada devoted specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems. They replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases.</p>", "534": "<p>*After getting a spare in the bowling match*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong>  Thank you, Jesus! As my mother would say.</p>", "535": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Holy crap on a cracker!</p>", "536": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So what's going on?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know. I looked around the room, and I saw all the faces and the presents, and it it was just too much.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet. It'll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.</br></br></p>", "537": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn't one of them. I think I need to just be your friend.</p>", "538": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She watched it. I'm gonna get that girl back.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> I only watched it because you emailed it to me with the subject line \"This is gonna make you mad.\"<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She was listening through the door. She wants me.</br></br></p>", "539": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hold on, Dr. Leonard, where are your social skills? This man is clearly upset. We should invite him in for a hot beverage.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> He tried to score with Penny.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So have these two and they're having dinner with us.</br></br></p>", "540": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> (About Sheldon) Why do I even try?<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm going to fix this right now.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, but just make it look like an accident.</br></p>", "541": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I've never done this before, it's kinda fun.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, if your mom could see her little Bar Mitzvah boy, she'd have a heart attack.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Good idea. I'll take a picture.</p>", "542": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Just you wait and see. I'm gonna romance your freakin' ass off.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's beautiful. Is that Shakespeare?</p>", "543": "<p><p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She's remarkable.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She really is.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How is it that she can remember all those lines, yet as a waitress she can't remember no tomato on my hamburger?</p> </p>", "544": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.\n<br/><strong>Alex:</strong> What?\n<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.</p>", "545": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hey. Hey, look at you guys!\n<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm Raggedy Ann, and he's Raggedy C-3PO.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It was a compromise. I lost.\n</p>", "546": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA and play real-life Operation.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh-uh.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't think so.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you sure? I mean, the nose doesn't light up, but if the corpse is fresh enough, sometimes you can get the leg to jerk.\n</p>", "547": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'll ring it up. It's like shooting nerds in a barrel.\n</p>", "548": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Y'know, if being on your own is new to you, I'd be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques for ladies I've perfected over the years. For example, do you own an electric toothbrush?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You should get one!<br/></p>", "549": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I have a two-part question.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Go ahead.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> A: Are you kidding? And B: Seriously, are you freaking kidding me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A: I rarely kid, and B: when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word \"Bazinga\".<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So you're saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. Bazinga. </p>", "550": "<p><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> *After he fixed Sheldon's algorithm* Gee, why can't Sheldon get a friend?</p>", "551": "<p><strong>Stephanie:</strong> So, how was your day? <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, I'm a physicist, I thought about stuff.<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> That's it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I wrote some of it down.</p>", "552": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who's Nowitzki?<br/><strong>Ramona:</strong> I'm Nowitzki.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, so you want me to share credit with you?<br/><strong>Ramona:</strong> Uh huh.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Get out!</p>", "553": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You keep him there a little longer, and when you get to the party, I'll point out which of my friends are easy.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't toy with me, woman.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong>  I got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem. I got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around, and an alcoholic who's 2 tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thy will be done.</p>", "554": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought \"Hey! Fish night-lights\". <br> <strong>Leonard</strong>: Fish night-lights. <br> <strong>Sheldon</strong>: It's a billion dollar idea, ssh!</br></br></p>", "555": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you.</p>", "556": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What are you doing here?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> I live here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have paperwork that says differently.</br></p>", "557": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> It is the things you love that make you who you are.<br/><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> I guess that makes me large breasts.</p>", "558": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Can I help you find anything?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> A comic that doesn't depict a woman whose bosom can be used as a flotation device.</p>", "559": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: But evolution is not opinion, it's a fact.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon's mom</strong>: And that is your opinion.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong> (to Leonard, Howard and Raj): I forgive you, let's go home.</p>", "560": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, what is going on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, no, no, no, I didn't forget. Um, there's this cat in a box and until you open it, it's either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother's camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. You're the whole package, aren't you?<br/></p>", "561": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Can I bring girls here?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, deal.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just not against their will.\n</p>", "562": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb.</p>", "563": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I need to sleep here tonight.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Why?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard is a total ass, Bernadette is in Penny's bed, Amy bites and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, come in.</br></br></br></p>", "564": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You slipped and fell into a robotic hand.<br/><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Penis first?<br/><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Yes.</p>", "565": "<p>*Sheldon is using a map of the U.S. to find out where he can move*\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Penny, you're from Nebraska, right?\n<br><strong>Penny</strong>: Born and raised.\n<br>\n*Sheldon crosses out Nebraska*</br></br></br></p>", "566": "<p><strong>Howard</strong>: Easy. Instead of saying; 'No we don't wanna go on an NSF expedition,' say; 'No we don't wanna spend three months stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag!'</p>", "567": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Did Sheldon change the Wi-Fi password again?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, it's \"Penny already eats our food she can pay for Wi-Fi\". No spaces.</p>", "568": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, its a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> You want to spank me?</br></p>", "569": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We'll miss you Sheldon.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, well, who wants to spend the whole weekend, running around a bunch of pretend planets, battling made up monsters? That's for babies.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, but it's got lightsabers.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Please, Amy! It's got lightsabers!<br></br></br></br></br></p>", "570": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I say we wait until he looks at us then laugh, like \"Yes, you're a smart and  strong competitor but we're also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you\".</p>", "571": "<p><strong>Penny</strong>: I always tear up when the Grinch's heart grows three sizes.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Tears seem appropriate.

Love, mom.\"</p>", "573": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You may have gone to Cambridge but I'm an honorary graduate of Starfleet Academy.</p>", "574": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What's up, buttercup?<br/> </p>", "575": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Come on, dude, bros before ... my sister.</p>", "576": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I made a new friend who likes trains as much as I do, I kissed Amy on the lips, and the conductor played his banjo for me.</p>", "577": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm sorry, shoes, but you have to go back.<br/><strong>Shoebox (Penny):</strong> But, Penny, we love you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I love you, too, but you cost more than my rent.<br/><strong>Shoebox (Penny):</strong> But Penny, you look so good in us.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (To Amy) Damn it, the shoes are right!</p>", "578": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her, Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me consolation. \"That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple\" but while thinking \"good, Leonard remains available.\"<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're a lucky man Leonard.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> How so?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, what do you think?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared.</br></br></br></br></br></p>", "579": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, this is different. Candles and music.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you like it?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's kind of spooky.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I can change it back.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, it's your birthday. As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, I'll be fine.</br></br></p>", "580": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, I really want to be your boyfriend.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I really want that, too.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good, because I love you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I love you, too.<br/><strong>Dave:</strong> Kiss her, you brilliant fool!<br/>\n(Sheldon kisses Amy)<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I'll let you get back to your date.</p>", "581": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are we going to do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perform the experiment immediately.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'd love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipment's on back order for a month.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A month? What? Are you kidding me? That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you. Aren't you sweet?</p>", "582": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's true. It means we care so much about each other, there's enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.</p>", "583": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink, I've wanted to go to an American prom. But then I saw Carrie and did not want to go to an American prom. Then I saw Never Been Kissed and I'm back on the prom bandwagon.

Ha! Next ...</p>", "587": "<p><strong>Mike:</strong> I don't know what's scarier: the bathroom clowns or the woman that put them there?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car.<br/>\n*Howard walks in*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And there's the clown that came out of her!</p>", "588": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party.

Perhaps reading to the elderly?<br/><strong>Dr. Greene:</strong> Excuse me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, but not your books. Something they might enjoy. I kid of course, big fan.</p>", "592": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We just thought you might want to go out and have a good time. Maybe go dancing?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, gee, thanks, but I'm not really in the mood.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai?</p>", "593": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Anyway, after we get done snowboarding, I go to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi. There's no one around, so naturally I'm free-balling it. Next thing I know, this beautiful chick shows up. Drunk out of her skull, wants to get in with me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Question: was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?\n<br/><strong>Kripke:</strong> Really, that's your question?<br/><strong>Zack:</strong>What's the difference?</p>", "594": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> The Flash shirt is what? Because you're gonna run really fast?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, the Flash shirt is because it's Friday. But it's nice when things work out.</p>", "595": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Wazzup, my nerdizzles?</p>", "596": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fellow warriors, this is Sheldor the Conqueror. We are about to enter Atzel's fortress. Now, this is a long run, so let's do another bladder check. All right, Barry, we'll wait for you again, but you really should see a doctor.<br/></p>", "597": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night.\n<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: Oh good God! Sheldon we don't ask questions like that!\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I heard you ask it over and over. How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?\n<br><strong>Stephanie</strong>: He did very nicely.\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: See? She's not offended. And now you finally have an answer.</br></br></br></br></p>", "598": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, here it is. Bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space. Is that true?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> No.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We seem to have different approaches here. I was going for helpful honesty. I have no idea what you're doing.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> It's called being nice.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. If you think being nice will get him to shut up, I'll try it.<br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>", "599": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I got a splinter.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What do you want me to do about it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Relationship Agreement - Section 4: Boo-boos and Ouchies. You have to take care of it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I should've gotten a lawyer.<br/></p>", "600": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I know the feeling. It's like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you. It happened to a friend of mine.</p>", "601": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Before you say anything, have you heard of Schrodinger's cat?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Actually, I've heard far too much about Schrodinger's cat.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Good.<br/>\n*Leonard and Penny kiss!*<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, the cat's alive.

Then they named stupid Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader, big old slutbag.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparible to a Nobel Prize?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, they're pretty tasty.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you ever truly believe that you were fit to be a cheer leader?</p>", "605": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, you're saying this is a regulation deck?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm saying believe in magic, you muggle.</br></p>", "606": "<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Would it be weird if I used your shower?\n<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: No.\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Yes.\n<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: (to Sheldon) No!\n<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: No?\n<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: No!\n<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: (to Penny) No.</br></br></br></p>", "607": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Really still can't talk to me?</p>", "608": "<p>*Howard imitates Raj's drunken Bollywood Breakdance*<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Dude, that's offensive.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, we all thought so.</p>", "609": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Engineering.

Hello, Oompa-Loompas of science.</p>", "610": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How could you just sit there and let them spy on me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They were very smart. They used my complete lack of interest in what you are doing.</p>", "611": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So in addition to being crazy, you're resting the weight of the mission on your athletic prowess?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> The man who crashed his stationary bike?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> I didn't crash it, okay? My playlist was too up tempo, I got light headed and I fell off.</br></br></br></p>", "612": "<p><strong>Santa:</strong> All right, let me see if I've got this straight. A picture of you on my lap is a way to punish your girlfriend for making you celebrate Christmas?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Correct.<br/><strong>Santa:</strong> Santa thinks dating you might be punishment enough.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's an argument for that, but I want to make sure.</p>", "613": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, I promise, your uvula does not have an STD.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you sure? It just doesn't feel as innocent as it used to.</p>", "614": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What are the sleeping arrangements? We've only been dating for three years.

I'm NOT taking you home!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Will you at least go with me to the restroom here so you can open the door and flush the urinal?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This might be a good time to point out, Howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take.<br/></p>", "624": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not saying that all senior citizens that can't master technology should be publicly flogged.

You can't hang out with your roommate's ex. That's totally uncool.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, it's fine. I don't care. I'm over it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, he's over it; that's why he's been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is he making any progress?

I'm just here to observe.</p>", "634": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What? No saws. One circumcision was enough.</p>", "635": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I got into science because I was always the smallest kid in the school. I thought if I became a scientist I could invent a formula that made me taller.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> That's cute.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I thought it was working for a while, but then I found out my brother was just lowering the pencil marks on the door frame.</br></br></p>", "636": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I get that you feel bad about all the attention, but still what you did is amazing. We're really proud of you.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm not.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're not?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I've been thinking about it and you're right. You don't deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, I'm embarrassed for you.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Damn it, everyone's better at this than me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Congratulations, Dr. Fowler.

Only 1400 bucks.</p>", "641": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why does Leonard get to go?<br/><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Because he's upset over his situation with Penny, and if I have to hear about it again, I'm gonna kick him in his ovaries!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thanks for understanding.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I've got your back, sister!\n</p>", "642": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> If anyone cares, I still have to pee.</p>", "643": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> She'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yay! If you'll excuse me, I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.</p>", "644": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line.\n<br><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Thank you, Sheldon.\n<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question.\n</br></br></p>", "645": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You went to the comic book store by yourself?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, it was fun. I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. It felt pretty good.</br></p>", "646": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I do not have to urinate. I am the master of my own bladder. Drat.</p>", "647": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Everyone at the university knows I eat breakfast at 8:00 and move my bowels at 8:20.<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: Yes, how did we live before Twitter?</p>", "648": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If I would give you this gift basket, based on that action alone and no other data, infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exist between us.<br/><strong>Store clerk:</strong> Excuse me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Here. Now, are we friends? Colleagues? Lovers? Are you my grandmother?<br/><strong>Store clerk:</strong> I don't understand what you're talking about and you're making me a little uncomfortable.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> See? Sounds just like you and Penny. We'll take it.\n</p>", "649": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: You are effectively paying yourself five dollars and nineteen cents a day.<br><strong>Penny</strong>: A day?<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: There are children working in sneaker factories in Indonesia who out-earn you.</br></br></p>", "650": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, you feeling better?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Not really.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, you have a guest who's upset.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll make tea.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sweetie, it's OK. I don't want tea.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not optional.</p>", "651": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You can lead a chicken to crisco, but you can't make your mother fry it.</p>", "652": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Damn you, you rat bastard! In the olden days, I never would have known he was that stupid.</p>", "653": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know what they say. Revenge is a dish best served nude.</p>", "654": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, you had a good run, fake Wolowitz. We'll remember you with nostalgic fondness. The way we do the dial-up modem, the VHS tape, or Leonard's gym membership.<br></br></p>", "655": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> They don't call me Brown Dynamite for nothin'.</p>", "656": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I have a sorta kinda boyfriend at home playing with a model train, but you don't hear me bitching about it.</p>", "657": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's going on?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, hey, it's not what it looks like. *Leaving*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What does it look like?</p>", "658": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a color to lonely.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Nothing rhymes with orange. Its probably lonely.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right. Come in. You look positively orange with loneliness. No, I dont see that catching on at all.<br></br></br></br></p>", "659": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to actually accomplish something.</p>", "660": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And here is my Justice League membership card, but that doesn't prove I know Batman. </p>", "661": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hands off my sister.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why would I touch your sister? She's all covered in airplane germs.</br></p>", "662": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are we talking \"date\", the social interaction or \"date\" the dried fruit?</p>", "663": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is banana bread.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> This is a door knob.</p>", "664": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Ears and genitalia. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about environmental factors. Describe the scene for me? <br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette drinking water. Carbonated as it was a special occasion. Penny's friend Zack stopped by and said 'hello' and I said 'whoo'. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who? <br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Zack. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Then why did you ask? <br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Ask what? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who? <br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Zack. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, lets start over. What did you say when Zack walked in? <br/><strong>Amy:</strong> 'Whoo'. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Zack. <br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why do you keep saying Zack? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because you keep saying who? <br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm not saying 'whoo' now, I said 'whoo' last night. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And the answer is Zack, correct? <br/><strong>Amy:</strong> There was no question, I simply said 'whoo'. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right I think I have enough to go on. <br/></p>", "665": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Aah, this takes me back. Leonard obsessing about Penny. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love your new stuff but, once in a while, it's nice to hear the hits.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Ooh, ooh, do \"our babies will be smart and beautiful.\" That one always makes me laugh.</br></p>", "666": "<p><strong>Howard</strong>: Are you familiar with the Drake Equation?\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?\n<br>\n[pause]\n<br><strong>Howard</strong>: Yeah, that one.</br></br></br></p>", "667": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Interesting! So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow account, as it were.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Pun intended?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, what pun?<br/></p>", "668": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me. Wolverine Origin, mini series issue two, page 22, retractable bone claws. You know, if you three spent less time thinking about sex and more time concentrating on comic books, we would have much less of these embarrassing moments.</p>", "669": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Does anybody have any wood? Oh, come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?</p>", "670": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I can't talk to the FBI.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Why? They're just going to ask background questions about me.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm brown and I talk funny.</br></br></p>", "671": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, have you ever told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, why don't you tell her?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right. It was hell.</p>", "672": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I assure you, you'll be sorry that you wasted your money on an iPod when Microsoft comes out with theirs.<br><strong>Rajesh:</strong> Do you have an opinion about everything?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> And you just assume you're right?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not an assumption.</br></br></br></br></p>", "673": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: You know, I've always wanted to go to a goth nightclub.\n<br><strong>Howard</strong>: Really?\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Bazinga! You never see any of my practical jokes coming, do you?</br></br></p>", "674": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you want me to tell you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to handle it?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your side.</p>", "675": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years! That's like as long as high school.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It took you 4 years to get through high school?</p>", "676": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> No, I'm not gay. If anything, I'm metrosexual.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> What's that?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It means that I like women, as well as their skin-care products.</p>", "677": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro football, college football, high school football, pee wee football - in fact, every form of football except the original, European football, which most Texans believe to be a commie plot.</p>", "678": "<p><strong>Rajesh:</strong> Okay, please don't take this the wrong way, but I'd rather swim buck naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow agonizing death from a viral infection, than work with you. </p>", "679": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar-tending shift, so I need to practice mixing drinks.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's Great! The key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> With certain obvious exceptions. ... Suicide, for example.</p>", "680": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'll let you in on a little secret. Originally, we were painted nude. But I had him add clothes cause I thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, good call.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> But, if you ever change your mind, all it would take is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're talking about the painting, right?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sure.<br/></p>", "681": "<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Who's Adam West?\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Who's Adam West!? Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?</br></p>", "682": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: (To Howard and Raj) Sheldon is at the Cheesecake Factory.\n<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: (On the phone to Penny) Just tell him to go home.\n<br><strong>Penny</strong>: Well, he won't leave. He says he's afraid he'll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs.\n<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: (to Howard &amp; Raj) He is paranoid and he has established a nest.</br></br></br></p>", "683": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Strap on a pair and go talk to Amy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Strap on a pair of what? ...Skates?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, you are so not the guy.</p>", "684": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I call Frodo!<br/><strong>Sheldon, Raj, and Howard</strong>: Damn!</p>", "685": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, my new friend's name was Eric, Amy's lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger but made up for it with his can-do attitude.</p>", "686": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hang on, hang on. Are all those things equal to you?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm, it never occurred to me to pick a favorite.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Give it a go.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't answer that without collecting additional data.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> \"Additional data\", you dog!<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me a dog, but all right.</br></br></br></br></br></p>", "687": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The word is Polish. See, look.<br>\nPolish sausage. And the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer. And then, finally, if that wasn't enough, which it should've been, this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized French citizen, was Polish by birth.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Excuse me, the word is polish. See? Small p.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah! So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one.\n</br></br></br></p>", "688": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If it's good enough for Kirk, Crunch, and Kangaroo it's good enough for me.</p>", "689": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I understand why you're upset.  You're afraid that costume makes you look fat.<br/></p>", "690": "<p><strong>Sheldon: </strong>Please. We're facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids. <br/><strong>Leonard: </strong>It's not so bad.<br/><strong>Sheldon: </strong>Not bad? It's horrible. You hear stories about this things, but you never think it'll happen to you.<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>:So they steamed your dumplings. Get over it.</p>", "691": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, I don't think I can do this.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.</p>", "692": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What is the best number? By the way, there's only one correct answer.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> 5,318,008?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wrong! The best number is 73. [Short silence] You're probably wondering why.<br/><strong>Leonard &amp; Howard:</strong> No no, we're good.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> 73, is the 21st prime number, its mirror 37 is the 12th and its mirror 21 is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, 7 and 3. Did I lie?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We get it! 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Chuck Norris wishes! In binary, 73 is a palindrome, 1001001, which backwards is 1001001, exactly the same. All Chuck Norris gets you backwards is Sirron Kcuhc!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Just for the record, when you enter 5,318,008 in a calculator, upside down it spells boobies.<br/></p>", "693": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American educational system.\n<br><strong>Kurt</strong>: You're a zebra, right?\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: (to Leonard) Yet another child left behind.\n</br></br></p>", "694": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I'll have a diet Coke.<br><strong>Penny</strong>: Can you please order a cocktail? I need to practice mixing drinks.<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Fine. I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.<br><strong>Penny</strong>: That's rum and Coke, without the rum?<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Yes, and would you make it diet?</br></br></br></br></p>", "695": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Look at that. You've known you're gonna be a father for less than a day and you're already stepping up.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm telling you, you got this.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe you're right.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course he's right. You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father. That's why I'm confident you're gonna be the best dad you can be.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Thank you, Sheldon.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're welcome. And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.</br></br></br></br></br></p>", "696": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's going to make me a chick magnet and I'm so busy as it is.</p>", "697": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey Sheldon, whattcha got there a new comic book?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Old comic book. I just got it from the safe deposit box.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> What do you have a safe deposit box for?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Old comic books.</br></br></br></p>", "698": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Bazinga, punk. Now we're even!</p>", "699": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What I am doing here is trying to determine when I am going to die.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> A lot of people are working on that research.</p>", "700": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, I don't know. I don't want to manipulate him with sex.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, sweetie, that's what sex is for.<br/></p>", "701": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Frankly, Mom, I'm encouraged to see how advanced your group has become -- willing to sail into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge.\n</p>", "702": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Sorry doesn't make up for the fact that I had to cook chicken and rice with this vegan guy. You know what vegan chicken and rice is? It's rice!</p>", "703": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh look, it's Harry Potter and 98% of Sorcerer's stone.</p>", "704": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, how've you been?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, my existence is a continuum, so I've been what I am at each point in the implied time period.<br></br></br></p>", "705": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Question: Where are my Pants?</p>", "706": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> By the way, where did you get that loofah mitt? Yours reaches places that mine just won't.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You used my loofah?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> More precisely, we used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out!</p>", "707": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well that's no threat, my mother's always wanted a grandchild.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Curses.</p>", "708": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did not reject you, you did not ask her out.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, goody! We're getting a cat.</br></br></br></br></p>", "709": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother. <br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, so?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What does that mean?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, you know how you're always saying Amy is a girl who is your friend but not your girlfriend?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh huh.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, you can't say that any more.</br></p>", "710": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Excuse me, I can't be drinking, I'm about to make an important scientific discovery here.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong>What? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How do you know that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> He was Italian, it's a reasonable assumption.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Dude, can you even open your mouth without saying a cultural stereotype?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm sorry. Galileo drank diet sprite.</p>", "711": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm a little low on cash.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How much you got?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Nothing.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How can you walk around with no money?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm cute, I get by.</p>", "712": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Goodnight, Stuart.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Goodnight.<br/>\n*Stuart and Amy hug*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (From inside Amy's apartment) Take the hint, Stuart, the lady said goodnight!</p>", "713": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, buddy, I'm gonna be in People Magazine.<br><strong>Charlie Sheen:</strong> Yeah, call me when you're on the cover.</br></p>", "714": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would you like some aloe vera? 'cause you just got burned.</p>", "715": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, many people believe home births are better because the mother's in a warm, comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic slip 'n slide.</br></p>", "716": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, I do recall seeing some female undergarments. Where was that? Oh, yes. Earlier this evening, I happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye. Do those look familiar?<br/> </p>", "717": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. By that definition, Penny is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.</p>", "718": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As a native Texan, I must say I've never heard the phrase \"yeeehaw\" used in quite that context.</p>", "719": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that's a fine how-do-you-do.\n(To Amy) Don't just stand there. Take your breasts out.</p>", "720": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Insurance will replace your car, it won't defunk my junk.</p>", "721": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My new computer came with Windows 7. Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista. I don't like that.</p>", "722": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know he (Spock) wouldn't care for an outburst of human emotion, but oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie!</p>", "723": "<p><strong>Amy Farrah Fowler:</strong> Did you know the iconic heart shape isn't based on an actual human heart, its based on what a woman's rear end looks like bending over<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So in 8th grade, I was dotting my i's with little asses? That's cool.</p>", "724": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hard as this may be to believe, it's possible that I'm not boyfriend material.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Glad I was sitting down for that.\n</br></p>", "725": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong>  I like the new look.<br><strong>Howard:</strong>  Thanks. I call it the Clooney.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong>  I call it the Mario and Luigi but whatever.</br></p>", "726": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Pee for Houston, pee for Austin.<br/>\nPee for the state my heart got lost in.<br/>\nAnd shake twice for Texas.</p>", "727": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Yes, since their relationship became carnal, Penny has updated his designated term of endearment, distinguishing him from those she calls 'sweetie,' usually as an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.<br><strong>Penny</strong>: You're boring people, sweetie.<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Although sometimes, she omits the veil entirely.</br></br></p>", "728": "<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Hey, guys! My friends and I got tired of dancing so we came over to have sex with you.<br/>(The guys continue to play Halo).<br/><strong>Penny</strong>: Told ya.<br/>(Penny and her friends leave).<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Why did you hit pause?<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: I thought I heard something.<br/><strong>Rajesh</strong>: What?<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: No, never mind.</p>", "729": "<p><strong>Shedlon:</strong> People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. Follow me. If the children can\u2019t run, leave them behind. Oh, the simulated horror!</p>", "730": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> (Talking to the snake) Let's go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You're better than this.</p>", "731": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Tweet that, tweetie bird.</p>", "732": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong>\nHello, Kripke. This classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper. If you would like to see the look on your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube. Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise.</p>", "733": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.</p>", "734": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know, 2/3 days, not important. I don't need sleep, I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, that's a crazy thing.</p>", "735": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that I am home safe does not prove it worked. That logic is post hoc ergo propter hoc. No, I'm not sassing you in Eskimo talk.</p>", "736": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it's not possessed by others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise \"neener-neener\".</p>", "737": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> We need to fabricate a tantalising piece of gossip.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And a second non-tantalising piece to use as a control.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Then we'll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of mimetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look at you, getting me to engage in the Social Sciences. You're a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler.</p>", "738": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well why don't you go to the movies then?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because who would be there to perform the Heimlich maneuver if I choke on my popcorn?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> So, don't buy popcorn. <br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No popcorn at the mo - listen to yourself!<br></br></br></br></br></p>", "739": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What are you doing here?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I've been up all night. I had a fight with Bernadette.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She bought me a nice watch.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, do you understand any of this?\n<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Talk to him.</br></br></p>", "740": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry but I'm not going to watch the Clone Wars TV Series until I've seen the Clone Wars movie.

Who wants it?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Maybe you should offer it to the pregnant lady.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And that would be..?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Me, Sheldon. I'm obviously pregnant.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, you never said it to my face. And the last time I assumed a woman was pregnant, it did not go over well.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I'm still mad at you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You were drinking water instead of wine. What was I supposed to think?</br></br></p>", "742": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because there's only one of me, I'm more valuable.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Right.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Although, Amy's already taken me out of my package and played with me.<br/></p>", "743": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon, what did Amy have that attracted you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, so many things. Her mind, her kindness, and especially her body.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Relax. We're the same blood type. He knew he could harvest an organ.</p>", "744": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What is this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed.<br/>\nI call these circles \"Zones of Privacy\".

Now, while you scold us, I'm going to get a knife and a fork. Joe may be sloppy, but Sheldon's not.</p>", "747": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, uh, Howard and Bernadette had their baby.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> (gasps) Oh, that's wonderful! Now, have they decided to raise it Jewish or regular?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Welcome to Texas.</p>", "748": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What is this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A functional MRI of my brain. I did Sudoku before they took it so I'd be ripped.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I love it. Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And it's not just an MRI. The orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because I was thinking of you.</p>", "749": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Don't come to the hospital. We're headed home.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that was fast. Did she sneeze the baby out?</p>", "750": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I don't mind, I'm very good at complaining. If it were an Olympic sport, I'd complain about what a stupid sport it is and then I'd take home the gold.</p>", "751": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Listen, you and I are gonna be sharing a bed. You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. How are you feeling about that?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain.</br></p>", "752": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> We wouldn't even sit in your spot while you're gone.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're darn right, you wouldn't. No matter where I am, this will always be my spot. Like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom.</p>", "753": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles. You know, once one pops one just can't stop.</p>", "754": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> So who else is coming to this shindig?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, well, the usual gang. Penny's family is coming tomorrow.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, and Leonards mother's already here.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh. Beverly. How nice.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You've met her, right?<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Yes, I have. (reveals her cross necklace)<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mother, she's an atheist, not a vampire.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Either way, let's stop and get some garlic.</p>", "755": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I love you. And I'm not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.</p>", "756": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> That was such a fun night.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Probably 'cause you got to see your man up there rockin' the mic.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, yeah. I was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, that was really an asthma attack. I just sold it.</p>", "757": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, and speaking of Valentine's Day, I haven't forgotten about you tonight.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What do you mean?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, you've become such an integral part of my life as well as this show, I felt it only right to include your name in the title.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, that is so sweet.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So from now on, this program will be officially known as Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present Dr. Sheldon Cooper's Fun With Flags.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Catchy.</p>", "758": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good. Then I'll be leaving now.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Oh, it's okay, Sheldon. Come with us.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that's very kind of you. But I'm sure you'll all have a better time without me. Let's go, Stuart.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> But I want to stay.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Stuart, now!</p>", "759": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, once we get the house back to ourselves, we can be romantic in any room we want.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Great. I can finally show you where the laundry room is.</p>", "760": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Come on, it could be romantic. The two of them away together, keeping each other warm in snowy Wisconsin.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no, no, no, no. She'd be going alone. If you think I'm scared of birds, you should see me around sheep.</p>", "761": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, what's the third option?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That I have coitus with her.<br/>\n(Penny's wine glass smashes in her hand)<br/></p>", "762": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know why the song was in my head.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's about Amy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, look, I know Amy's like an old lady, but she's not old enough to have a song from the '60s written about her.</p>", "763": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, we've known each other a long time. We are perfectly capable of having a conversation without relying on a list off the Internet.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right. Well, what should we talk about?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't know. Just ask me whatever comes to mind.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Very well. I know you've been seeing other men. Have you had coitus with any of them?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Man, I walked right into that one.</p>", "764": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I think it's so adorable you're making Sheldon breakfast.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, he's having a rough time. Amy broke his heart, the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who, that crow followed him home.</p>", "765": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You're not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I-I was always a Hubba Bubba man.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble? You're crazy.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, the jaw wants what it wants.</br></p>", "766": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, it's your third date, maybe you could go more sexy.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.</p>", "767": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you sure? I've heard that on those sites, often when you think you're corresponding with someone, it's actually a computer program pretending to be a real person.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And you're afraid it'll do a better job than you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me. No one does a better job pretending to be a person than I do. Siri comes close, but I know more jokes.</p>", "768": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> May I say something?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Is it about how I can't have new wallpaper 'cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Never mind.</p>", "769": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Stuart took that rejection like a pro.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, he knew he was on the breast cam.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't have much practice turning men down. It wasn't so much fun.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, you get used to it. Some guys you have to turn down over and over.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And sometimes we marry them anyway.</p>", "770": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I understand that we are no longer a couple, but I'd like to remind you that we made a baby together.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What baby?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A precocious, little Internet show known as Fun with Flags.</p>", "771": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Whose bra is this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not yours? Oh, my. How embarrassing for both of us.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's Penny's.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey. You broke up with me, it's none of your business whose naked bosom I'm smushing around like pizza dough.</p>", "772": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia, I don't think you understand how being broken up works.<br/>\nCan you believe that? You'd think the Czech Republic would try to hold on to what it did, given it's not as young as it used to be. And I don't see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders.</p>", "773": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Your friends? I think you mean my friends. And why wasn't I invited to this?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We make everyone feel awkward. That's our thing!</p>", "774": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Aww, that was beautiful.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah. I mean, not like our wedding beautiful.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, we totally won.</p>", "775": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can't believe I'm spending my wedding night with you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? I never imagined it any other way.</p>", "776": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, playtime's over. Let's open this baby up. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Won't that void the warranty? <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, I have a master's degree in engineering. I wipe my bottom with warranties. Except for AppleCare. That pays for itself in the long run.</p>", "777": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Greetings from Planet Earth. Just turn left at Alpha Centauri. You can't miss it.</p>", "778": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> First take a picture with me. <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why? <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, Raj and I always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so I taught myself and I'm putting this on Instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. Say cheese!</p>", "779": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you think there's a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynman's house and everyone in it?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, buckle up. You're in for a cranky night.</p>", "780": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement which you insisted upon, we're not allowed to pout or be moody on date night.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.</br></p>", "781": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> When there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees.</p>", "782": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You here looking for money? <br/><strong>Josh:</strong> No. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver? <br/><strong>Josh:</strong> No. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You're in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.</p>", "783": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What are we doing? This is a fort. Let's sit on the floor. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Roughing it? Okay. *sits on floor. Gasps* Everything looks so big from down here. This must be how Leonard feels.</p>", "784": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, you kids have fun. I'm going to go to sleep. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, don't you want to see the inside of the fort? <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, I'm good. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they can't come in.</p>", "785": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Can I come in? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, oh, but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket.</p>", "786": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, instead of protecting me, why don't you try being excited when something good happens?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm always excited for you. I'm excited that you found this new job where you're making decent money.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Decent? I make twice what you make.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait, twice?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Like times two, twice?</p>", "787": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, sweetie, you should really get some money.</p>", "788": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this? So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple of years. That's the way life is. And I'm sure, in time, they'll change again.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Great. Not only are you more successful than me. Now you're more mature.</p>", "789": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Come on, one day this may double in value and be worth half what I paid for it!</p>", "790": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, the Daleks are right on my tail. Quick, we need to reset the time circuits. Oh no, I left my Sonic Screwdriver behind.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really should have thought this through.</p>", "791": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's not your fault.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Not your fault.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist, I didn't correct him?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey look at that pretty bird.</p>", "792": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, man. This is the boutineer from my high school prom. A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Did she throw anything away?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No. If I find my foreskin, I'm gonna kill myself.</p>", "793": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Certainly a lot more women are reading comics now.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> True. At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet.</p>", "794": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why a turtle?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> After much deliberation, we've determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They don't shed fur. They don't make noise.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobble stone.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And, if he ever goes beserk, I know I can out run him. Coincidentally that's also why I chose you as a roommate.</p>", "795": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Let's pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Ooh, how about this one up on the log?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm, I don't know. He kinda looks like a jerk.</br></p>", "796": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How about this one?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> He's barely moving. He looks half dead.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know. I like him too.</p>", "797": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What should we name him? I came in thinking Seth, but he kinda looks Italian.</p>", "798": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What's happening?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Raj was snooping through Emily's drawers and broke one.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, I'm gonna miss her.</p>", "799": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So you're saying you wouldn't leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I would at least mention it before filling out the application.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm. That's exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said.</p>", "800": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> And who says you could even survive an inter-planetary mission anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> First of all, this has only made me stronger.</p>", "801": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I think you broke the dowels. You're not gonna have time to glue it back on. You'll have to nail it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> With what?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> She does.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?</p>", "802": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important. My hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don't trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally, nothing.</p>", "803": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It seems a shame to throw it away.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon and tell him William Shatner painted it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> God, I love you. I love you so much.</p>", "804": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars.<br/>\nWe could be the first to watch Mars Attacks on Mars.<br/>\nWe could be the first to say \"Good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?\"</p>", "805": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> We could also be the first people to procreate on Mars.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You just can't keep it in your space pants, can you?</p>", "806": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be martians.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They would, wouldn't they? We could give them cool martian names. We could teach them about martian history, like who planted those flags or where'd that copy of Mars Attacks come from.</p>", "807": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Your entire job is to find lost luggage and you've narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet Earth?</p>", "808": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, not to steal from the bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.</p>", "809": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Do you want to stop? I know you have trouble with eye contact.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula 1 race car, so I'm just concentrating on that. Plus it's easier around people I'm comfortable with.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, sweetie, I'm comfortable around you, too.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course you are. I'm warm and soothing. I'm like a human bowl of tomato soup.</p>", "810": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I didn't care for her yelling, but now that I'm not going to hear it again, I'm sad.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> If you want, I can yell at you later.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It won't be as good.</br></p>", "811": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him, he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends, he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant.<br/><br/>\nWhy are you laughing? Did you learn something?</p>", "812": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let it go? I have heard that my whole life. Every time something upsets me, someone says let it go. Like it's my fault and it's not okay to feel the way I feel.</p>", "813": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Why don't you just clean out the whole room? Take the string-art clown I made her in third grade. And the ribbon I got in swim class for putting my face in the water.</p>", "814": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Some son! Looks like you spent ten minutes on that clown art.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, maybe I should have gone to a fancy art school like you, then I could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guy's mother.</p>", "815": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I like it. I think you're on to something.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? You're not messing with me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not at all. In fact, I have got something for just such an occasion. I was starting to think I'd never get a chance to give it to you. Good job!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're giving me a sticker?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not just a sticker. That's a sticker of a kitty saying \"Mee-wow\".<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm not a preschooler.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine, I'll take it back.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I earned this. Back off.</p>", "816": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You wrote a paper on my idea?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I wrote a paper on our idea.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> When did my idea become our idea?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness and cooked it in the Easy Bake oven of my mind.</p>", "817": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, that's enough.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What, no. I really want to know what happens. And Bernadette really, really, really wants to know what happens.</p>", "818": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? Oh, that's fantastic. No wait, they're dropping. Why are they dropping?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Because you're happy they're elevated.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that is infuriating. Oh look, they're going back up again. Terrific. Oh no, they're going back down.</p>", "819": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> At least listen to it through headphones. I'm trying to sleep, good night.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Boy. Taylor was right. Haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.</p>", "820": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> This isn't so bad.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's easy for you to say. Your chair isn't facing the lingerie section. Boy that's a lot of panties.</p>", "821": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't understand why women insist on making a big production about buying clothes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're right. We should do what you do, have our mom send us pants from the Wal-Mart in Houston.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They have a man there who understands my personal style.</p>", "822": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?! Then why don't you do it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, it's scary, and sometimes I get the pedals mixed up. But more importantly, driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose. I can't take that away from you, so what do I do? Come on, I'm practically feeding you the answer. I compromise.</p>", "823": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Not really a great outfit for work. Unless something opens up in the Hookers &amp; Whores department.</p>", "824": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're mean to me a lot. You think I don't notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls, but I do. I have excellent peripheral vision. On a good day, I can see my ears.</p>", "825": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He were go, compromising again. We really are the best.</p>", "826": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Seriously, you were just gonna drive away? Like my life isn't hard enough right now? A space probe might be destroyed. My parents are going through an awful divorce. The guy who cuts my dog's hair just gave her bangs.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Raj!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You saw her. She looks like Jim Carrey from Dumb &amp; Dumber!</br></p>", "827": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why'd you turn it off?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town, kissed mommy, and ran grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him.</p>", "828": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The truth is, I can no longer balance a full time career, a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board.</p>", "829": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, I thought cleaning out a dead professor's office was gonna just be boring, but then I found his dentures and realized it's also gross.</p>", "830": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If I could, I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flag pole and salute you. And if you touch the ground, burn you.</p>", "831": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> It's sweet that you care about him so much.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I do. And I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if something happened to him, and I wasn't at his bedside to say \"I told you so\".</p>", "832": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, you're a neruobiologist. Get in there and spray some Raid.</p>", "833": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, what's up with you guys?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We're just saying all the things we love about each other.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, like you and I did at couple's therapy?</p>", "834": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I ordered it before you had surgery. It's the urn I was going to put you in.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, that's morbid. Send it back.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't send it back. I had it engraved. \"Here lie the ashes of Leonard Hofstadter. He thought he was right, but his roommate knew better.\"</p>", "835": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sorry, kid, you got it worse than a gibbon.</p>", "836": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You went to seven proms?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. Let's see, four \"under the seas\", two \"enchanted evenings\", and one night to remember - that I can not remember for the life of me.</p>", "837": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why can't he take your mom? You took her to your prom.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I didn't take her. She was a chaperone.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I saw a picture of you two dancing together.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well what was I gonna do? They were playing our song.</p>", "838": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I may be an alien, but I have urges. If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well then I will happily catch them with the reproductive sack on my upper flermin.<br/>\nI'm not the best at reading facial cues, but I can see that you're a little turned on.</p>", "839": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You're making me worry. What's going on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's going is we're about to go to a prom and there's a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Bob Eubanks called \"makin' whoopee\".</p>", "840": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wow, Donkey Kong. This was my game when I was a kid.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because it's a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small oddly-shaped man?</br></p>", "841": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, you can't just go chasing after every girl who's nice to you.<br/><strong>Dr. Lorvis:</strong> Well, that's not what Sheldon says, and he seems to know his way around the ladies.</p>", "842": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It wasn't until his twenty-first birthday that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wow wow wow. Is 'placed' right?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you mean?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is 'placed' the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> 'Had will have placed'?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's my boy.</p>", "843": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You guys kiss and hold hands.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I've seen him do it. It's not romantic.</p>", "844": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Will you stay out of this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If only Penny had said that once in a while.</p>", "845": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, I understand. You wanna do something you're already good at? I know, why don't I get you a job at the sitting around all day wearing yoga pants factory?</p>", "846": "<p><strong>Dan:</strong> You're scared of Bernadette?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, kinda.<br/><strong>Dan:</strong> I thought it was just me! Everyone thinks she's so nice with the little squeaky voice!</p>", "847": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How's your mom holding up?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She's okay, but we just lost another nurse.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> How many's that now?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Two, and I know what you're thinking: she's eating them.</p>", "848": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> In any event, while I've had my misconceptions about *Penny*, Sheldon spoke very fondly of her. And if she is good enough for him, then she's good enough for me.</p>", "849": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm writing an appeal to the faculty senate so that I can move on from string theory.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How's it going?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You tell me. \"Dear esteemed colleagues. As you may know, I have requested to change my field of study. My decision to do so is, I believe, in the best interest of science. At your convenience, I'd be happy to explain it to you in words you'll understand.\"</p>", "850": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny, will you marry me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh my god, yes!</p>", "851": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You sure? Not even coffee? We have R2-Decaf. Maybe a nice Cafe au Leah.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And if you're not in the mood for coffee, I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO.</p>", "852": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Why're you being so quiet? You upset or are you just rebooting?</p>", "853": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know that face. That's your proposed face.</p>", "854": "<p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Where are we?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is the swampland of Dagobah. It's where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi.<br/><strong>Arthur:</strong> Oh, too bad. I thought it was Florida.</p>", "855": "<p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Is this the first time you've lost someone close to you?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no. I've already had to say goodbye to eleven Doctor Whos.<br/><strong>Arthur:</strong> Yeah, I've outlived a few of my doctors, too.</br></p>", "856": "<p><strong>Arthur:</strong> Just make sure you appreciate those who are still there for you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I do appreciate them.<br/></p>", "857": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know when Cinnamon won't take her medicine. I hide it in a piece of cheese.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Good idea. We can wrap up the pill in cheese, feed it to Cinnamon and then my mom can eat Cinnamon.</p>", "858": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, listen to this. Murder, cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand-plus horrors that await.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I just helped my mum out of the tub, so I'm one slippery horror ahead of you.</p>", "859": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Why can't I be in a relationship with a girl who likes The Sound of Music?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Raj, you are the girl in the relationship who likes The Sound of Music.</p>", "860": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, you really struck a nerve. I've never heard him use the M-word before.</p>", "861": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How's dating two women going?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Umm, kinda hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasn't the only person I was seeing, it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> She had mixed feelings. But when I said \"Emily was cool with it, Emily's the best, why can't you be more like Emily?\", those feelings became less mixed.</p>", "862": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (on Stephen Hawking's voice mail) I kiss girls now.</p>", "863": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Have you heard from Howard?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I did. His talk at NASA went great.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon didn't heckle him?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No. In fact, he was so well behaved Howard bought him a Buzz Aldrin bobblehead and astronaut ice cream.</p>", "864": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I told Howard if I wasn't busy I'd spend the night at his mom's. So for God's sake, think of something.</p>", "865": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You really going to lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> What do you think I was going to do at home?</p>", "866": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. If someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least get a vote.</p>", "867": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.</p>", "868": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Raj, your tag's sticking out. *Bernadette tucks Raj's clothing tag back in*<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you. That's the closest I've come to sex in like two years.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Now I feel a little gross.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You're only making it seem more real for me.</p>", "869": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.</p>", "870": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have one question. Is this a prank? Where you land in Houston and you've made up wanted posters which have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name, and I get arrested and deported to South America?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well I'm glad, because I would not have seen that coming.</br></p>", "871": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm sorry too. It's all my fault.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you weren't my friend there'd be a hole in my life.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thank you, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled, but not as big.</p>", "872": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Why can't they do something sensible like Sheldon, and start their own comic book convention? Also, who wants to throw me out that window?</p>", "873": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't understand what we're doing.<br/><strong>James Earl Jones:</strong> Shhh!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Whose house is this?<br/><strong>James Earl Jones:</strong>  Carrie Fisher. And she's a little crazy so get ready to run.</p>", "874": "<p><strong>James Earl Jones:</strong> What were you trying to ask me at the strip club?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How much does it cost to get them off my lap?</p>", "875": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, Stuart.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> *startled* Hey.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sorry, did I startle you?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Yes, but at this point pretty much any customer does.</p>", "876": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Thank you, I needed to hear that. Why can't Leonard understand it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because he's not like us, Penny. We're dreamers!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car.</p>", "877": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> (Talking \"It's A Wonderful Life\"). It's great. It's Christmas time, and Jimmy Stewart's really depressed and he's gonna jump off a bridge and kill himself.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Don't need to see it, living it!</p>", "878": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is no way to make new humans. People coming out of people. Like some dirty magic show.</p>", "879": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's that animal doing in our apartment?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She's in her crate, she can't get out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have two words for you: Jurassic Park.</p>", "880": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon, I think you might find the support you're looking for if you realize relationships are a give and take. She can only be there for you as much as you are for her.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Thank you, Rajesh.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon and stop pressuring him into accepting intimacy on your terms.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You should probably go.</p>", "881": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know if we did a shot every time they said something embarassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Little early for alcohol, isn't it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (On the radio) You know, I don't just say smart things about science, I also yodel. *Yodelling*<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'll get the vodka.</p>", "882": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Not cool, bro. I'm starting to think you're not the kind of guy I want dating my wife.</p>", "883": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, well, she's not going to be your wife for long.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> (To Penny) Oh no, are you dying!?</p>", "884": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I just wanna check her out because she hurt my friend. My Indian friend. Who's racist now?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You! Because you just called him your <em>Indian</em> friend.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, well ... you're short.</p>", "885": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, you wanna take a break? Your food's ready.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you doing? He's both happy and quiet. It's like seeing a unicorn and big foot at the same time.</br></p>", "886": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So I'm almost done writing the song for Bernadette. Are you cool playing the cello?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If by cool you mean willing to, yes. If by cool you mean cool, clearly you've never seen me play the cello.</p>", "887": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've got to find a way to stop this thing.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Buddy, I don't think you can. Once it's out there, it's out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Frankly, I'd prefer a sex tape.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You don't know what a sex tape is, do you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No.<br/></p>", "888": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How do I make them stop loving me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You could invite them to live with us.</p>", "889": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's a big deal.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know. When will this nightmare end?</p>", "890": "<p><br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's actually steamier than it looks. Sheldon's looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in renaissance paintings.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh no, I got bored of that. I'm just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon.</p>", "891": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me, so I'm trying to find something beloved of hers and ruin that.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Because her life wasn't enough?</p>", "892": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Hello, Leonard.\n<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mom?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I understand you have been whining about my parenting in order to emotionally manipulate your girlfriend.</p>", "893": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not a child. I know the word 'ninny.'</p>", "894": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Careful, Amy. The friend of the enemy's girlfriend is my enemy.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're either with me or against me.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You wanna take the bus to work?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Maybe there's a third option.</p>", "895": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon's nervous about me leaving. Just keep an eye on him while I'm gone.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I don't know. Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one.</p>", "896": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> I'm having trouble with my pacemaker.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'll call for help.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Any chance we could plug it into the potato?<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> No.</p>", "897": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Party's over. Party's over.</p>", "898": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> My wife came with both fun bags and money bags.</p>", "899": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay Sheldon, to start our quest, you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Christmas? You know I don't enjoy Christmas.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, where to begin? Trees indoors. Overuse of the words 'tis' and 'twas'. And the absurd custom of one stocking. Everybody knows that socks comes in pairs. Who uses one sock?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> A pirate with a peg leg?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Actually, that helps, thank you.<br/></p>", "900": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, some day, if you get a car, I'm sure they'll give you another parking space.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't want another parking space. I want my parking space. It's perfect. It's a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half. It's a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks.</br></p>", "901": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, make Howard stop being naked in my spot!</p>", "902": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, I remember my first bikini wax. My sister did it with duct tape and melted Crayolas. To this day, I can't look at a box of crayons without crossing my legs.</p>", "903": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> And action.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> And cut! You realize I'm doing this for free, right?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes, and so far we're still not getting our money's worth.</p>", "904": "<p><strong>Stephen Hawking:</strong> What does Sheldon Cooper and a black hole have in common? They both suck.</p>", "905": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Stop it! Today is not about you, it's about Howard and Bernadette, and me!</p>", "906": "<p><strong>Mr. Rostenkowski:</strong> Walnut?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, thank you. I'm allergic.<br/><strong>Mr. Rostenkowski:</strong> Oh, sure. My partner used to have that. He's dead now.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> From nuts?<br/><strong>Mr. Rostenkowski:</strong> Nah, his wife shot him. But she was nuts, so in a way.</p>", "907": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> It's this dress. When I put my front in, my back pops out. When I put my back in, my front pops out. It's like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub.<br/><strong><strong>Sheldon:</strong></strong> What do you want me to do?<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> We're gonna have to work as a team. Get in here, grab a handful and start stuffing.</p>", "908": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What is the truth?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My Mr. Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later, he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, that I believe.</p>", "909": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Look, if you don't want to go to the party, just don't go. You're a grown man. Act like one. Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends!</p>", "910": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'd make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems, if I wasn't shocked that Sheldon has girl problems.<br/></p>", "911": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Howard Joel Wolowitz, I've been worried sick for two days and I know you turned off your phone. You open this door right now because I've had it up to here! I have been to the morgue and the hospital, and I spent the last half hour walking up these fakakta stairs.</p>", "912": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Bongo solo!</p>", "913": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> [Chuckles] Look at that. There's finally a woman in your life you can talk to.<br/></p>", "914": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And now that I have some wood, I'm going to begin the erection of my settlement.<br/></p>", "915": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Come on, Sheldon, Star Wars.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm pushing play. I mean it. If we don't start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again.<br/></p>", "916": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? On top of everything, you're afraid of birds?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Its called ornithophobia and someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is unfortunate because I have a fear of nets.</p>", "917": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The two of you need to get your women in line!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Last night, I was strong armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler. This on a night that I had originally designated for solving the space time geometry in higher spin gravity and building my Lego death star. And why? Because your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette, went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy. An action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory, or my Lego fun time! <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What do you want us to do about it? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You clearly weren't listening to my topic sentence. Get your women in line! You make them apologize to Amy and set things right. I am a man of science, not someone's snuggle bunny!<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why do I have to talk to Penny? She's not my girlfriend. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You invited her to lunch four years ago. Everything about her is on you. You make it so! </br></p>", "918": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> New topic: women. Delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?</p>", "919": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> I thought it was our Indians that had the occasional alcohol problem.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> We don't say that either. I'll make you list.<br><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh, that'd be mighty white of you.</br></br></p>", "920": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Sheldon, your friend is hurting. What do we do when someone's hurtin'?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Offer them a hot beverage.<br><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> And when they're drunk as a skunk, what beverage do we offer?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Coffee.<br><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> And what do we do it with?<br>\n*Sheldon smiles*</br></br></br></br></br></p>", "921": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Maybe a little Rodeo Drive.<br><strong>Mary: </strong> Well, I can't spend $12,000 on a handbag. But it's free to look upon those that do with righteous condemnation.</br></p>", "922": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Lord, Mary Cooper here, coming to you from Gomorrah, California.</p>", "923": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, uh, okay, um, I dont want to get back together with Penny. We tried it, it was crazy, it didn't work, but I can't deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj. And then I find out that Raj's sister Priya, who I've been going out with for eight months, is moving back to India. So I'm just completely confused and alone.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I understand.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Got any advice?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Yes. Buck up.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Excuse me. You're a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development, and all you've got is buck up?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Sorry. Buck up, sissy pants.</p>", "924": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Rotting Zombie. Sheldon's new Facebook picture.</p>", "925": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hope you're hungry.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Interesting. A friendly sentiment in this country, a cruel taunt in the Sudan.</p>", "926": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Waving Zork game) Pick me, pick me, I'm fun.<br/><strong>Kripke:</strong> That all sucks the big hairy meatball.</p>", "927": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Thanks to you, I just made a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist.</p>", "928": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You seem to have forgotten the reason we live together is that we're best friends. And I've got your back, Jack.</p>", "929": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, that's fine, but let's try and get you out of your comfort zone.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why would we want to do that? It's called the comfort zone for a reason.</p>", "930": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I suppose everyone's entitled to their own opinion. I think I'll turn in. I didn't wanna teach those poopy heads anyway.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> FYI, I think that's what Darth Vader said just before he started building the Death Star.</p>", "931": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What, I'm not hot enough for Angelina Jolie?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Id like to weigh in here: No.</br></p>", "932": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't worry.  Wonder Woman was an Amazon.  And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.</p>", "933": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Wow, this place is awesome. Where do they keep the Archies?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Oh, no, you're thinking old-school Archie. It's much more sophisticated now. Like, there's two universes, and Archie's married to Betty in one and Veronica in the other. Midge is even breaking up with Moose.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> About time, right?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hey.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Hey.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> You guys finally chip in for a bodyguard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, no. Oh, this is Zack. He's a friend of ours. Zack, this is Stuart. He owns the store.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Wow, lucky you.<br/>\nStuart: Yeah, I work 70 hours a week and average a dollar sixty five an hour.<br/>\nZack: Sweet.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Is that sarcasm?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Uh, no, it's an indictment of the American education system.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> The Archies are over here.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Yippee.<br/></p>", "934": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well you don't have to worry, we broke up again.<br>\n*Sheldon gives awkward look and then throws his papers in the air with one of them landing next to his head.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you ever think about other people, Leonard? Do you? </br></br></p>", "935": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Guys, I just did a quick calculation. Judging by the size of the theater and this line we may not get in.<br/>\n(Sheldon wakes up and jumps out of his chair.)<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What did he say?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Nice going, Raj. I just got him down for his nap.</p>", "936": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, if it isn't Wil Wheaton, the Jar-Jar Binks of the Star Trek Universe!<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> (Imitating Jar-Jar) Me-sa think that's funny.</p>", "937": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Howard, get the door.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Why can't you get it?<br><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> You know I'm doing a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy. I'm like an upside-down volcano here.</br></br></p>", "938": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, you're so arrogant. If you were a super hero your name would be Captain Arrogant. And do you know what your super power would be? Arrogance.</p>", "939": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's preposterous. I'm not pining for anybody. <br><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh, lamb chop. We can quibble what to call it, but I think we can both agree it's creepy.</br></p>", "940": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I'm sorry to inform you that you've been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey upon the gullible and the lonely. Additionally, I am being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.<br/><strong>Amy</strong>: If that was slang, I'm unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery.</p>", "941": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: *Knock Knock Knock*  Penny. *Knock Knock Knock* Penny.\n<br><strong>Penny</strong>: *Opening her door* ... Penny.\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: That's just wrong.</br></br></p>", "942": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I think I caught the flu. *Throwing up*. Or the plague!</p>", "943": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> On the contrary I find the Grinch to be a relate-able and engaging character. And I was really with him, right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention, returned the presents and saved Christmas.</p>", "944": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Ha-ha! Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's not fair! I got stuck behind a tree.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And a cow, and a penguin. Face it dude, whether it's a real car or a virtual car, you can't drive.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just need a little more practice.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a genie who grants wishes to little boys who sucks at MarioKart.</p>", "945": "<p><strong><strong>Howard:</strong></strong> Hey, ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?<br>\nMrs. <strong><strong>Wolowitz:</strong></strong> Lamb stew? I'd have to go to the supermarket.<br/><strong><strong>Howard:</strong></strong> Please? I got a real hankering.<br/>\nMrs. <strong><strong>Wolowitz:</strong></strong> Oh, I can't say no to my little tushie face. I'll be back soon.</br></p>", "946": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> Howard! What are you doing in there?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm taking a bath.<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> I hope that's all you're doing, we share that tub.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't remind me.</p>", "947": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> A long time ago, I made a deal with Howard involving you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, I don't know where this is going, but tread carefully, because this may be the last conversation we ever have.</p>", "948": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Hold your horses, young man. Here in Texas we pray before we eat.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aw, mom.<br><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> This is not California, land of the heathen.</br></br></p>", "949": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You set it on DTS, didn't you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I had to, she called me cutie.</p>", "950": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, it looks like you're caught between a rock and a crazy place.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I hate when that happens.</br></p>", "951": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Howard, there's a blonde girl, Patsy, here to see you.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Who?<br><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Okay, now she's saying it's Penny.</br></br></p>", "952": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Normally, I can just ignore you. I mean, I get it. You're a little peculiar. Like Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me, Penny, but in this room, you're the one who's peculiar.</p>", "953": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's your favorite fruit?<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Strawberries.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mmm, technically not a fruit, but all right.</p>", "954": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: If I'm permitted to speak again, Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win!</p>", "955": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Tell her we're going to the Olive Garden. I have a coupon from the paper.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> We're not going to the Olive Garden, ma!<br><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Oh, Mr. Big Shot with his Red Lobster.</br></br></p>", "956": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am very, very sorry for what I have done. Here's your laundry, I rescind your strikes and you are no longer banished. </p>", "957": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> This has gotten way out of hand, okay. I've done some stupid things, you've done some stupid things. How about we just call it even, and move on with our lives?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've done no stupid things.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, you've gotta meet me halfway here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am meeting you halfway. I'm willing to concede that you've done some stupid things.</p>", "958": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Level 3 and she thinks she's rich. What a noob!</p>", "959": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> What's going on? Are you boys roughhousing?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> We're just talking, ma.<br><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> If you don't settle down right now, I'm not going to let you have any more sleepovers.</br></br></p>", "960": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Incredible. You managed to screw up the screw up.</p>", "961": "<p><strong>Leslie:</strong> There's no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we've seen each other's faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus. Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance, are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom.</p>", "962": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is this the stuff you want me to try on?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No this is the stuff I want you to throw out. Seriously, don't even give it to charity. You won't be helping anyone.</p>", "963": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sorry, I'm late.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What happened?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nothing. I just didn't want to come.</p>", "964": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, what fresh hell is this?</p>", "965": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Gee, Sheldon, you're asking the wrong girl. I'm usually on the other side of the tie.</br></p>", "966": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Dr. Gablehouser, are you busy?<br><strong>Dr. Gablehouser:</strong> Well, actually.<br><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Sheldon, he's just doodlin'. Get in here.</br></br></p>", "967": "<p><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper spray.</p>", "968": "<p><strong><strong>Sheldon:</strong></strong> That's the toilet?<br/><strong>Policeman</strong>: Well, it ain't a wishin' well!<br/><strong><strong>Sheldon:</strong></strong> Please tell the judge I'm ready to apologize.</p>", "969": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Given that Saint Valentine was a 3rd century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn't a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one's steady gal to witness a brutal murder? </p>", "970": "<p><strong>Todd Zarnecki:</strong> Who is it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Your doom.</p>", "971": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We have no idea what pathogens Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment. And having never been to Nebraska, I'm certain I have no corn-husking antibodies.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, don't you think you're overreacting?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When I'm lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these gelatin cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance.<br/>\n*Sheldon holds a Q-tip toward his mouth for Leonard to swab*</p>", "972": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You can't blame yourself. When your pre-frontal cortex fails to make you happy, promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of Dopamine. We neurobiologists refer to it as the skank reflex.</p>", "973": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> (Reading Sheldon's relationship agreement) Section 5, Hand Holding: Hand holding is only allowed under the following circumstances: A. either party is in danger of falling of a cliff, precipice or ledge;  B. either party is deserving of a hearty hand shake after winning a Nobel prize;  C. moral support during flu shots.</p>", "974": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> \"See you in hell Sheldon\"? The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma.</p>", "975": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Boy, oh, boy. This vacation is off to a wonderful start. The smell of formaldehyde, the whir of the centrifuge, the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection. Mm, I can already feel my cares just melting away.\n<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm excited to work with my boyfriend.

You'll be living with me, because we don't live in the same house.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> But that's not your fault. Like you, we're taking it ridiculously slow.

I mean, honestly, there's no telling what will set you off. Introducing myself as your boyfriend. Giving you the opportunity to drive me home. Breaking the ice with you colleagues using ethnic humor - the funniest kind of humor.</p>", "1102": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Come on, dude, I'm exhausted and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night's sleep.</p>", "1103": "<p><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Have you told your parents you're dating this short glass of skim milk?\n</p>", "1104": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> We can't keep explaining everything.

We're just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you've done.\n</p>", "1120": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Howard, relax. I am not interested in your girlfriend.\n<br><strong>Howard</strong>: I hope not.

Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you're my girlfriend?</p>", "1128": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wine and a girl in the dark. He's going to be bored out of his mind.<br/></p>", "1129": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's kinda like the Loch Ness Monster. Maybe there's something there, maybe there isn't. We'll never know but sometimes it's fun to creep yourself out thinking about it. <br/></p>", "1130": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> When he wasn't happy, we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That seems like a bit of an overreaction.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled-dog team and yell \"Mush!\"</p>", "1131": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: You are not Isaac Newton.<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: No, no, that's true.

I got cocky.</p>", "1136": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Gentlemen, as much as I'm sure Sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic make-believe, he and I have other plans.

She won't be disappointed for very long.\n</p>", "1137": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You interested in Amy?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, I mean she didn't look through me with soul-sucking ball-shriveling hatred and contempt.

Well, that can't be very popular.</br></p>", "1145": "<p><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday.

Of course, I was 14 and had already achieved more than you could ever hope to, despite my 9:00 bedtime. Now, there may be one or two of you in this room who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics. It's more likely that you will spend your careers teaching fifth graders how to make paper-mache volcanoes with baking-soda lava.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, good God.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you. A cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now, if you'll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out.

I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know I'm gonna regret this, but what trauma?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> On my 12th birthday, I really wanted a titanium centrifuge so,  you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Of course, yeah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me-- Wow, this is hard. They got me a motorized dirt bike.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What 12-year-old boy wants a motorized dirt bike?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All of them.</p>", "1150": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Why are you learning Chinese?\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken, and I intend to confront them.\n<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: If I were you, I'd be more concerned about what they're passing off as chicken.\n</br></br></p>", "1151": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's all right, they didn't take my comic books.</p>", "1152": "<p><strong>Raj</strong>: These methods of meditation come from the ancient gurus of India, and have helped me overcome my own fears.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And yet, you can't speak to women.<br/><strong>Raj</strong>: True, but thanks to it I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating.</p>", "1153": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you want?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You may wanna sit down.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm in bed.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Point taken.

But I think that idea is isguided and oronic.</p>", "1160": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Mmm, what smells so good?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer. A perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes, it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97-pound blister. And finally, its main ingredient is paneer, a farmer's cheese that would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes.</p>", "1161": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No one calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw.</p>", "1162": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As a mental exercise, I invite you to figure out why the two of us can't play three-person chess.</p>", "1163": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and immediately adjacent to that hallway is this!<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable explanation to why we are here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I just gave you a reasonable explanation.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, no.

Whose head did I just blow off?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mine!</p>", "1165": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Obviously, we're no longer a Justice League.

He's the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies.<br/></br></p>", "1166": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> *singing in the tune of \"Eye of the Tiger\"* It's the eye of the tiger, it's the ear of the bat.

Leonard, you talk to Penny.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> What makes you think I can convince her?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> You got her to have sex with you.

French kissing, seven minutes in heaven culminating in second base.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Neck massage, then you get me that beverage.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> We cuddle.

We're physicists. We are the intellectual descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have this. I don't have this. I don't have it! <br> <strong>Sheldon</strong>: Archimedes would be so proud.</br></br></br></p>", "1224": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As usual, you're all wrong.

Oww! Here's a new one, apparently we kick each other on the shins under the table.</p>", "1264": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I love Little House.

Given the professional standstill you're at, you're wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching.\n\nYes! And if I may suggest, consider changing discipline. To the humanities or perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don't have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuffs that happened and then parrot it back.

How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: I forget, which one is Hammer of the Gods?<br><strong>Raj</strong>: We hide behind the dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.</br></br></p>", "1317": "<p><strong>Tom:</strong> I'm sorry, dude, she didn't look anything like her picture.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> They never do.</p>", "1318": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How are we gonna get it upstairs?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If we take the dish off, it might fit in the elevator.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, but the elevator's been broken for two years.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call about that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Not necessary, I have a master's in engineering. I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. I troubleshoot satellite payloads. When the Mars Rover started pulling to the left, I performed a front-end alignment from 62 million miles away.

I'd just like to say there's absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind. Which means - and again, no insult intended - you're a fraud, your profession is a swindle, and your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people.

The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy.<br/>\nThey have the best buys, but having the best buys isn't the only thing that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What makes a best Best Buy the best Best Buy?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mm, that's a great question.

The first, is a chance for her to play the harp with the L.A. Philharmonic.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow. You can really arrange that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I said a chance. When you tell them it's your birthday at Bennigan's they make a fuss.

Probably nothing. I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.</p>", "1418": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not going. Would you like to know why?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're sad about not getting any thing done last night, so you're gonna sit around and pout about it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Boy, I'm not nearly as mysterious as I think I am.</p>", "1419": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but when a mouse completes a maze, it gets a food pellet.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And its last meal was a food pellet? You're a monster.</p>", "1420": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> We watch movies with director's commentary.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, my favorite. George Lucas can talk through the entire movie but I say one word and I'm banished to the kitchen.</p>", "1421": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know what you could make us do? Ice skating. The cold air will trigger Leonard's asthma, and it plays into my well known fear of getting flattened by a zamboni.</p>", "1422": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Interesting. We're being accused of making you do things you don't like, and here you are doing the same thing to poor Amy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You should point out the hypocrisy of that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's what I was doing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that was wasn't clear. Do it again but this time drive it home with, \"how do you like them apples, missy?\"</p>", "1423": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What do you say? It sounds kinda perfect.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It does, but somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Once again, it's what I do.</p>", "1424": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know why you're so surprised. If there's one thing I know after living with you all these years, it's how to compromise.</p>", "1425": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm surprised to see you suddenly get religious.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Because I've known you for ten years, and you've never gone to temple. You've never talked about believing in God. And last Diwali, I watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow at a Brazilian steak house.</br></p>", "1426": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Twenty hours.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, that's rough.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Not at all. Did you know that when you fly Transcontinental without your wife, you don't pray for the plane to crash?</p>", "1427": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Relax? Easy for you to say. Your mother isn't cleaning out your bank account. Forty years, the woman never cleaned a thing.</p>", "1428": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I guess the sad truth is not everyone will accomplish something great. Some of us may just have to find meaning in the little moments that make up life.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's a nice way of looking at it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, for you, not for me. I went to space, so I'm covered.</p>", "1429": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> This is an easy one. You love this guy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Me.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Come on. He's an under appreciated genius.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Still think it's me.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's not you. Now think, there's a car named after him.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course there is. The Mini Cooper because it's me.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> How about this? He's a poor man's Sheldon Cooper.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Tesla.</p>", "1430": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I assume this medical center's already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Cause I'm a liar, liar?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's for the Fire Marshall to determine.</p>", "1431": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Don't be like that. You two need to talk this out.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, because you sound really funny.</p>", "1432": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren't dating.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Like who?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Like you and your dog.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't rule out the dating.</p>", "1433": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was, but Penny didn't want to. You didn't want to. Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn't want to. And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.</p>", "1434": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Delivery men are the unsung heroes of our nation's commerce. It's because of people like you that people like me can limit our human contact. I'd shake your hand but, well, you know.</p>", "1435": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, I was wrong. Heaven does exist. And it's in the basement of a urologist's house in Sherman Oaks.</p>", "1436": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Maybe he's playing bingo with his mommy?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sad how some guys just can't cut the apron strings.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, now you're messing with me.</p>", "1437": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Doc, you've got see what you're doing is a little creepy.<br/><strong>Dr. Lorvis:</strong> You sound just like Sigourney Weaver when I followed her into a restroom.</p>", "1438": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hang on. You guys are going to work in a mine?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash!</p>", "1439": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You call yourself a friend? I was trying to help you. And at the first sign of trouble you ran away, leaving me to fend off a family of rats! You're a completely selfish human being and a physical &amp; moral coward.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> His statements of the obvious continue to annoy.</p>", "1440": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm not the kind of guy who drops his friends because he's in a relationship.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> What happens if she doesn't like us?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, you're my dear friends. You'll get a Christmas card for a couple of years and then you're dead to me.</br></p>", "1441": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You told Emily we hooked up?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, in my defense, I tell everybody.</p>", "1442": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have real problems here, Amy. I can't be mollified with a beverage designed for children. *Takes a sip* Mmm, yummy.</p>", "1443": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I've seen old pictures of you. You were never a fat kid.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling.</p>", "1444": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?</p>", "1445": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> How do I know what you said? Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.</p>", "1446": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, my aunt changed her diet and in a few months -<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Went to space? I don't think so! Now pass the soy sauce. Not the green one, the red one.</p>", "1447": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you want the long answer or the short answer?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> How come we never get that option?</p>", "1448": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ooh, flowers and chocolates? Somebody's trying to get me out of my panties.</p>", "1449": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Aw, jewelry. Oh my God, Lakers tickets!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It gets better. Instead of me you can take someone who will actually enjoy it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You are the best boyfriend ever.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Seriously, please don't make me go.</p>", "1450": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh my God, Cinnamon, are you okay? I can't believe you two (Leonard &amp; Penny). (To the vet) You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs any new organs I'll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts!</p>", "1451": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, while they're acting like teenagers we could do something grown up.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Ooh, you mean like a museum?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes, like a museum but anything else!</p>", "1452": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Let me ask you a question. When did you guys start feeling grown up? Because I'm not sure I do.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Honestly, I thought when I got married I would, but I still feel like I'm pretending. It doesn't help that most of my clothes come from Gap Kids.</p>", "1453": "<p><strong>Carrie Fisher:</strong> It's not funny any more, James.<br/><strong>James Earl Jones:</strong> Then why am I laughing?</p>", "1454": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Come on, take me to work with you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, you're on vacation.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Please! What if there's a big break through in science today and I'm not there to see it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You really think there's going to be a breakthrough without you to do it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. I was just tricking you.</p>", "1455": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, Sheldon sent us all an email. \"Happy Holidays from Texas\", and there's pictures. *Looks at his phone* Aww, do not open them. Do not open them!<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh come on, childbirth is a natural, beautiful - Urgh, it's like someone sawed a cow in half.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> My father is a gynaecologist, I think I can handle it. *Looks at his phone* And ... now I'm gay.</br></p>", "1456": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I missed you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> To quote Han Solo, \"I know.\"<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Did you miss me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I would have preferred to have you there with me.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Aww.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Or instead of me.</p>", "1457": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Yeah, I'm an author now, I do public speaking and I have my own web series about board games.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (To Wil) We're trying to cheer up him.</p>", "1458": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Sit, you look like you've had a long day.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Naw, she always looks like that. ... Because she married an idiot.</p>", "1459": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> It's like if you're dating someone you're not that into and then they break up with you. Then you want them more than ever.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have no idea what she's talking about, but we're ganging up on you so I agree.</p>", "1460": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> How can you not be happy? You're tall, thin and famous.  ... Oh my God, I'm jealous of Sheldon.</p>", "1461": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon's being reasonable.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, it's freaking me out. I'm gonna go.</p>", "1462": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> How come you've never done anything romantic to celebrate our first date?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> For starters, you've broken up with me so many times, which first date are we talking about?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, somebody call the burn ward. ... And back to the zone.</p>", "1463": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, Bernie. What happened?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Let's just say the next time you move a dozen vials of raccoon virus to the fridge, make two trips.</p>", "1464": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Leonard, give me a beat.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I will not.</p>", "1465": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, are we really doing this? Or are we tricking him again like with the dinner party?</p>", "1466": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It smells pretty ripe in here. You kinda feel it in your eyes.</p>", "1467": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Oh please. You're a tall glass of brown water. Have dessert.</p>", "1468": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, all my life I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others: handshaking, hugging, prostate exams. But I'm working on it, you know? Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy's chest. A year ago, that would have been unthinkable.</p>", "1469": "<p><strong>Kripke:</strong> My work would suffer too if I was getting laid all the time.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, that is the reason. My work is suffering because of all the laid I am getting.<br/><strong>Kripke:</strong> You lucky bastard.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What can I say, you know? She enjoys my genitals. I am giving them to her on a nightly basis.</p>", "1470": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> Wives don't take boys from their mothers.</p>", "1471": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Oh, Internet. This is so going all over you.</p>", "1472": "<p><strong>Kripke:</strong> Well, as long as we're here, I might as well take a leak.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Kripke, you're in my spot.<br/></p>", "1473": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, great! I get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the Village People.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You make that joke every three months and I still don't get it.</br></p>", "1474": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh no, they sent the wrong Spock.\nLive long and suck it, Zachary Quinto!</p>", "1475": "<p>(Leonard &amp; Alice are kissing)<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Damn it, I can't. I can't do this.<br/><strong>Alice:</strong> Is it my tongue stud? 'Cause if that freaks you out, you're in for a real surprise later on.\n</p>", "1476": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You heard me, I forbidded it.<br><strong>Priya:</strong> Forbidded it?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Forbayded  it?</br></br></p>", "1477": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Travel makes me constipated so I am the ideal hotel roommate.</p>", "1478": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I must take responsibility, I had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.<br><strong>Leonard, Raj, Wolowitz</strong>: Oh, oh, ok.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe she's experiencing her menses.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Actually, I'm not. In order to avoid surprises, I wear them all the time.</br></br></p>", "1479": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What ya doin' there? Working on a new plan to catch the road runner?</p>", "1480": "<p>Zack: Hey, I want to see this laser thing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, but what about the party?<br/>\nZack: It's a surprise party, doesn't matter when we get there.</p>", "1481": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Do or do not do there is no try.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did you just quote Star Wars?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I believe I quoted The Empire Strikes Back.</p>", "1482": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Yeah, I have to say I thought the toilet humor would get less funny with repetition. Apparently there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop.</p>", "1483": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> If you want to have intercourse with that girl, find out what kind of cologne her father wore.</p>", "1484": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You can't let her get into your head.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's too late for me, my head is her summer house.\n</p>", "1485": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm curious. What was Leonard like when he was little?<br><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I think you mean young. He's always been little.</br></p>", "1486": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, would you be prepared on a non-presidential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc slurpee/icee equivalency? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh Leonard, you know I can't do that.</p>", "1487": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.</p>", "1488": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Mock me if you will, but it works. You show up at a club in something distinctive, scope out your target and toss out some negs.\n<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What are negs?\n<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> A neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game. Like \"Normally, I'm not turned on by big teeth, but on you, they work.\" I've got a whole list of em. Who wants to be my wingman?\n<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're not gonna need wingman, you're gonna need a paramedic.\n</p>", "1489": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You've already got Penny?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So I can have Penny?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hell, no!</p>", "1490": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Virgin diet cuba libre please.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> OK.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In a tall glass with a lime wedge.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh I'll wedge it right in there.</br></br></br></p>", "1491": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one.</p>", "1492": "<p><strong>Leslie:</strong> Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he starves to death.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Who wouldn't?</p>", "1493": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> We're putting the play on for one night in this little 99-seat theater. Can you come? Oh great! Do you know 98 other people that might want to come? </p>", "1494": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Before I met you, I was a mousey wallflower. But look at me now. I'm like some kind of downtown-hipster-party girl with a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things!<br/></p>", "1495": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I just assumed. Who sells a full-sized time machine for $800?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In a Venn diagram that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets 'no longer want my time machine' and 'need $800'.</br></p>", "1496": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (Yelling at Raj) I'M NICE TO EVERYONE!</p>", "1497": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined forks.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Three tines is not a fork. Three tines is a trident. Forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas.</p>", "1498": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, Sheldon, I understand that youre going through a bit of a career crisis, you're searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Go away! </br></br></p>", "1499": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Why don't I talk to him about it in May?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> In May, you're gonna be on the International Space Station.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> They got a phone.<br/></p>", "1500": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well if it isn't Wil Wheaton, the Jar Jar Binks of the Star Trek Universe.</p>", "1501": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you Kripke for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends.<br/><strong>Kripke:</strong> My pleasure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My thank you was not sincere.<br/><strong>Kripke:</strong> Hmm, but my pleasure is.</p>", "1502": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes. But on a more serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing \"Halo\".</p>", "1503": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Biologists are mean.</p>", "1504": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Going to Wheaton's party is not betraying you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it's doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you're looking for.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm going to a party. I'm not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not yet.<br/></p>", "1505": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Ok, two words. Deaf chick. It doesn't matter if I can't talk because she can't hear me. <br><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> That's what she said.</br></br></p>", "1506": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Ubuntu. You're my favorite Linux-based operating system.</p>", "1507": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh Lord, this can't be more humiliating.\n<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, no, no, give him a minute.</br></p>", "1508": "<p><strong>Raj</strong>:  I'm telling you, Leonard, video slot machines, free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp for $3.95. Disneyland can suck it. This is the real happiest place on Earth.</p>", "1509": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> This girl is trouble. What kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> The best one I've ever had!</p>", "1510": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you even think about other people, Leonard?</p>", "1511": "<p>(Sheldon repeatedly knocking and saying Leonard's name)<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ugh, this would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath!</br></p>", "1512": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You can't ruin a friendship with sex. That's like ruining ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.</p>", "1513": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You can't wear the hands on the date. <br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hulk sad!</br></p>", "1514": "<p><b>Penny</b>: Since when do we offer one day rush?\n<br><b>Leonard</b>: Amazon offers one day rush.\n<br><b>Penny</b>: Yeah, but they don't have to glue the books together!</br></br></p>", "1515": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wow, I'm feeling the urge to hug you. And 1, and 2. All right, Gollum, we're good.</p>", "1516": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Amy, you're on rolls, cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> *To Bernadette* That's right, I see you.</br></p>", "1517": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's great you're here. I'd love to get an engineer's opinion.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This chair is squeaky. Now, do I fix it or get a new one?</p>", "1518": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Maybe your friend Gundersen needs to head over to IKEA and assemble a sense of humor.</p>", "1519": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Clarify something for me. Isn't the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions, an opportunity to consider important issues of the day?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It is. You just kinda put a damper on things when you said, 'The next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death'. </p>", "1520": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Is he always like this when he loses?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, yes. You should have been here for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You bumped the table and you know it.</p>", "1521": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Merry Newtonmas everyone.</p>", "1522": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: And good evening to you, Siam Palace, this is Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I'm going to be dining alone this evening, so I'll be reducing my usual order. I'd like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and one half of the Golden Treasure for two - oh, for heaven's sake! In the mid-18th century, King Rama the Fourth of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his throne. Surely you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings.</p>", "1523": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else's sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone in the restaurant to order the other half?</p>", "1524": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, we're going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ooh, dark matter. We better bring a flashlight, ha, ha.<br/>\nSheldon stares at Raj.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I was making a joke.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm the boss. I make the jokes.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sorry, go ahead and make your joke.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is not the time for joking.</p>", "1525": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the Planet Hoth? No, he opened a Ton Ton to keep his body temperature from plummeting.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You heard the man, hold him down and I'll cut him open.</p>", "1526": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The dice giveth and the dice taketh away.</p>", "1527": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You slept with my sister?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> How could you? We had a pact.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Excuse me, I think \"How could you, she's my sister\" takes precedence over a 5-year-old pinkie swear.</p>", "1528": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me, but the problem is not solved. If your head had been accidentally amputated and we transplanted a dog's head in its place, would that be problem solved?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If it were your head it would be.</p>", "1529": "<p><strong>Sheldon: </strong> 1234 is not a secure password.</p>", "1530": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here.</p>", "1531": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> That top has paid off in free drinks 10 times what I originally paid for it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, Penny has a lot of money tied up in promiscuity futures.\n</p>", "1532": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know if I wanna play any more.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because you don't have a girlfriend? Well, good lord, if that becomes a reason to not play dungeons and dragons, this game is in serious trouble.</p>", "1533": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Did he somehow just give me the finger?<br/><strong>Howard</strong>: Not just the finger, the moving finger!</p>", "1534": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Damn you, walletnook.com!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Problem?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The online description was completely misleading. They said 8 slots plus removable ID. To any rational person, that would mean room for nine cards. But they don't tell you the removable ID takes up one slot. It's a nightmare!</p>", "1535": "<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Honey, you don't have to thank me every time we have sex, sweetie.</p>", "1536": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Goodnight, painting Penny. Goodnight, real Penny.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Goodnight, real Amy.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You don't have to say goodnight to painting Amy, because she's never leaving. \n</p>", "1537": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: You keep in mind that my sharply-worded comments on Yelp.com recently took down a muffin store.</p>", "1538": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I can't believe Sheldon gave this up.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know. We're gonna have so much more fun than him.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, they're not.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Knowing them, they will.</br></br></br></p>", "1539": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, you were driven mad by an earworm. Your mind, once your most trusted asset, is now a sack of parrots and monkeys. So I'm going to tell you everything you need to know. Uh, first, music is dangerous. The movie Footloose tried to warn us, but we wouldn't listen.</p>", "1540": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, I'm so sorry.<br><strong>Dave:</strong> No, it's fine. It's why I left England. It reminded me too much of her.<br>\nCold, gloomy and easily accessed by a Frenchman through a tunnel.</br></br></p>", "1541": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> How could you send her away?!<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She was late. And she found atomic spectroscopy boring. I wouldn't coitus her with your genitals.</br></p>", "1542": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What kind of music are you thinking of?<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> I like all kinds of music, but my favorite genre is free.</br></p>", "1543": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Thanks a lot, guys.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What did we do?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Before I made that call, my pig was alive and happy and rolling around in the mud. Now he's illegally buried in our backyard next to my great-grandmother.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Really? They didn't eat him?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No! He was a beloved member of the family.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> The breakfast meat family?</br></p>", "1544": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> My old scarf.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You wore it the night we went ice skating, remember?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You mean the night that I went ice skating and you stood at the rail Googling the symptoms of hypothermia.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We made one heck of a team, huh?</p>", "1545": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I wonder if that's why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon. I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave, and I was nursing a baby. But the baby had Sheldon's head on it.<br><strong>Mandy:</strong> And your wife is worried about me?</br></p>", "1546": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, you don't need to worry about her. She's brilliant and attractive. She can do way better than Leonard.</p>", "1547": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you realize I don't live with the woman I love because of you? No other reason. Just you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is that true?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, it's true. The last time I brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown, got on a train, and ran away.</p>", "1548": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I feel renewed. I'm ready to deal with any changes that come my way. *Sees Penny* Your hair is different. You changed your hair. I can't take this. I'm out.</p>", "1549": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Next time I get a speeding ticket, here come the waterworks.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Here come the waterworks!<br/>\n*Sheldon runs off to the bathroom*<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aren't you going to ask?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What is this, my first day?</p>", "1550": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Cinnamon, guess who just did it \"human-style\".</p>", "1551": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wish you never did.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Yeah, I know a little something about that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> I remember why it's been a while.</p>", "1552": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You've spent time with Amy, can you think of anything she's fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn't noticed?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> ... I got to go.</p>", "1553": "<p><strong>Beverly:</strong> Let's discuss why you continue to involve me in your sex life.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, please no mommy. No mommy.<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> When you were six years old, you walked in on me and your father naked. I was swatting his bottom with your brand new ping-pong paddle.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I didn't dream that!?<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> How did that make you feel?</p>", "1554": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said, \"I am a rock. I am an i.....sland\".</p>", "1555": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Seriously, is that tape? Like, how are they staying up like that?</p>", "1556": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Your threats are empty. Nothing can move me.<br/>\n(Howard drives his car slowly towards Sheldon, pushing his chair forward)<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's it! I'm calling campus security! You prepare for the scolding of your life!</p>", "1557": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, come on, the man torments me. I'm just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sheldon doesn't know when he's being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain.</p>", "1558": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Some kind of nerd? I'm the king of nerds.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What does that mean?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It means that if someone makes me mad, I won't help them set up their printer.</p>", "1559": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Remarkable. Diamonds. Crystalized carbon. Every day, people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon, in the form of charcoal brickets, which they toss in their barbecues and set on fire. But just because you have some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly, you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars.</p>", "1560": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't watch you twenty-four hours a day. I don't know what you do.</p>", "1561": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Amy, little vixen. Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester.</p>", "1562": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (To the smoking monkey) You really are an ass.</p>", "1563": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Forgive me, but I think you'll find my story is more interesting.<br><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Does your story have wet breasts in it?</br></p>", "1564": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Impressive, but we must be cautious.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Today, it's a Chinese-food-retrieval robot. Tomorrow, it travels back in time and kills Sarah Connor.</p>", "1565": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When was the last time you had your menstrual cycle?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I'm not answering that Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm going to say in progress.</p>", "1566": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, I get it. You're angry. You don't want to see your little bird leave the nest.<br><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Little bird? You're almost thirty. Fly, for God's sake!</br></p>", "1567": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What up moonpie!</p>", "1568": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: No, absolutely not. <br> <strong>Sheldon</strong>: It's not a big deal.We have latex gloves. <br> <strong>Leonard</strong>: I don't care what the symptoms are. My girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam.</br></br></p>", "1569": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?</p>", "1570": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> (to Leonard) Go ahead. Tell her about your senior prom.</br></p>", "1571": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: (Knocking on Penny's door early in the morning). Penny, Penny, Penny!<br/>(Penny opens the door).<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Good morning.<br/><strong>Penny</strong>: Do you have any idea what time it is?<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Of course I do. My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one-tenth of a second, but as I'm saying this it occurs to me once again your question may have been rhetorical.</p>", "1572": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm curious, what part of America is that accent from?</p>", "1573": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: I'm sure she'll still love him.<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I wouldn't.<br/></p>", "1574": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: You know I'm in such a good mood I'm actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today.</p>", "1575": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: How about that, Einstein was wrong.\n<br><strong>Penny</strong>: What?\n<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: Approaching the speed of light doesn't slow down time, approaching them does.</br></p>", "1576": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: What self-important preening fraud are they honoring this year?<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: I'm so glad you asked it like that. You!</p>", "1577": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> *Noticing Raj peeking through someone's window using the telescope* Oh, Raj, no. Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don't have to peep through windows.</p>", "1578": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Excuse me. You're misusing the word 'ho'. It's an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in 'land ho' or 'westward ho'.</p>", "1579": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Penny.\n<br/><strong>Penny</strong>: What?\n<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I can't sleep.\n<br/><strong>Penny</strong>: Maybe that's because your hole is still open.\n</p>", "1580": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Doesn't anyone wanna know where he's going?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, where is he going?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard is going to the office.</p>", "1581": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on whole wheat.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What did they give you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Turkey and Roast beef with swiss and lettuce on whole wheat.<br/>\n*The guys look at Sheldon*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich, the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash.</p>", "1582": "<p><strong>Janitor:</strong> The answer is minus eight pi alpha.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hang on a second, that's not our answer.

You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.</br></br></br></p>", "1584": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hay Leonard, check this out. * Throws won-ton in the air and catches it in her mouth *<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, she's doing it again.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, it upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers with out guard of equitable distribution. * Turns to Raj * This is essentially why you have famine in India.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You want me to put it back? *Said with mouth full of food *<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.</p>", "1585": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Stuart's kind of interested in Amy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well of course he is.

I love you.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, you call it love but it has a lot of raisins in it.</br></br></p>", "1590": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, that's it.

That's what made them perfect. There were no awkward hellos in the halls. There's no clickety-clackety of high-heel shoes on hardwood floors. They may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape. And without that annoying ammonia urine smell.</p>", "1624": "<p><strong>Sheldon's computer:</strong> We are out of herbal tea.

No wedding jitters?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. There is nothing in the world that would stop me from marrying you tomorrow, even me from the future coming back to prevent the wedding and the subsequent birth of a child who will destroy humanity.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Because if you came from the future, that would mean you already went through with the wedding because you believe that time travel is on a closed loop.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I love you so damn much.</br></br></br></p>", "1648": "<p><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> Welcome.

I do like metal detectors and the sound of permits being denied.</p>", "1653": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Neither of them will be the actual cake. I'm just using it as a bargaining chip to get Amy to agree to the whole wedding party getting rings and us getting one ring to rule them all.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I forget, which mental hospital are you guys registered at?</p>", "1654": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Look, I I can see you're upset, but I'm gonna need some ground rules. I mean, while we're apart, can I see other needy Indian men?</p>", "1655": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard thinks when we broke up, it didn't bother me.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> That's crazy.

Like the old song, \"When a man has a biochemical reaction for a woman.\"</p>", "1658": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Until next week, this is Professor Proton saying, 01000010 01111001 01100101.

And then five years later, bingo-bango, something happened.</p>", "1665": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And just remember, I am proud of you and I support you in all that you do.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Thank you. That means a lot.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, and one last thing. If you find yourself working with a male scientist who's as smart as me, as tall as me and has hair like Thor, well, then I want you to step away from the situation and call me immediately.</br></p>", "1666": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong>  Physicist, baker, lover, what can't I do?</p>", "1667": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Where's Howard?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> He took the day off.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, let's take advantage of his absence and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get. I'll go first.<br/>\nOkay, here. Uh, Heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer. And the policeman says, \"Did you know you were going 85 miles per hour?\" And Heisenberg says, \"Darn it, now I don't know where I am.\"</p>", "1668": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> If you don't know how to make lasagna, Google does.</p>", "1669": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, do you want to come?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, thanks. I already live in a place all the nerds come to.</p>", "1670": "<p><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> What's this?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, nothing. Just some math we don't need.<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> This is a different approach. Are you trying to get the guidance system even smaller?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's just a theory. Uh, it's not even worked out.<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Oh. I want this.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But we've already met the agreed upon specs. Going smaller would require weeks' worth of new computations.<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> So get the kid with the two shirts to do it.</p>", "1671": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> The kid with the two shirts screwed us again.</p>", "1672": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> How'd you even get that up the stairs?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I said to myself, \"I think I can, I think I can.\" And then I couldn't, so I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later.</p>", "1673": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Sheldon, if you're trying to prove me wrong, the tighty-whities on your head ain't changing my mind.</p>", "1674": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, I just learned Amy went to a theme park without me, but I'm not going to ruin her birthday. I'll wait, and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year.</p>", "1675": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not my fault I'm bad at sharing; I skipped kindergarten.</p>", "1676": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If it's like your 3-D chess game, then you're out of your length, width and depth. Amy, get the Neosporin, somebody just got burned.</p>", "1677": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> They say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planets.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know what, I've met Bert. Isn't he an indicator of life on other planets?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You used to make those jokes about me. Now everything's Bert, Bert, Bert.\n</p>", "1678": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What do you think?<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> That ... is ... hilarious! Give me the remote control. I want to drive him into the girls' restroom.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, we're done. It's offensive.</p>", "1679": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I'm glad to see you moving forward.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Bert did quality research. And he deserves whatever accolades he receives.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What is going on? (To Leonard) Did you upgrade his software last night?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I think he might be learning on his own.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Then the robot uprising has begun.</p>", "1680": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Stuart, wait. I do know what it feels like to be left out.<br><strong>Bert:</strong> I know how it feels, too.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, this is about me and him; you're not part of it.</br></p>", "1681": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> The new neighbors are weird.</p>", "1682": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Now Sheldon's popular? What is happening?!</p>", "1683": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sorry I flipped out on you. I think it's just hormones.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it's fine.</p>", "1684": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I now pronounce you husband and wife. And weird other husband who came with the apartment.</p>", "1685": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, look, I'm on the Air Force Web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, please, that's not how it works. You saw E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World. The military just shows up and takes over.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You do realize those weren't documentaries, right?</p>", "1686": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, what did we miss?<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> Oh, just Mary and I getting to know each other a little.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Leonard, your father is just charming.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> He's also broke. Did he mention that?</p>", "1687": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> When's the screening?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, it's tonight, but it's first-come, first-served, so we should probably get there early and wait in line.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Let's do it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny's busy with my mother, so Im in.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, bad news. Amy's making me go shopping with her later, so looks like none of us can go.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You do realize were allowed to have fun without you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> In fact, that's usually the trick to it.</p>", "1688": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> *Knock, knock, knock* Amy. *Knock, knock, knock* Amy. *Knock, knock, knock* Amy.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Come in.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, everyone. Oh, Beverly, good to see you. I'd love to chat, but there's a line that could start moving any minute, so let's do this. Amy? A proper apology requires three steps. Step one, an admission of wrongdoing. Amy, I was wrong. Step two, a promise never to repeat said action. Amy, that action will never be repeated, and that's a promise. Step three, an earnest request for forgiveness. Amy, I hope you can forgive me. And I hope you do it right now, 'cause there's an Uber waiting downstairs, and I don't want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Fine.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, thanks, you're a peach. Beverly, we'll catch up soon. Bernadette, it was a pleasure as always. Penny, you have spinach in your teeth.</p>", "1689": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I got here as quickly as I could.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're too late.<br/>\n*Sheldon plays \"Taps\" and drapes a cloth over his laptop.\"<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, this is silly.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You got emotional when that lab monkey died.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.</p>", "1690": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I shouldn't be raising a kid. I don't even eat my own vegetables.</p>", "1691": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You guys, the bathroom here is amazing. There's people cooking in it.</p>", "1692": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Enjoy the neurobiology conference.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I will. I wish you were here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> At a neurobiology conference? What a mean thing to say.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, I'm glad you're not here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aww, you always know just what to say after I tell you what to say.</p>", "1693": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't think I can walk right now.</p>", "1694": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, this is a thermostat. It controls the temperature of the apartment. The ideal setting is 72 degrees. If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket. A straitjacket, 'cause 72's the best and you're crazy.</p>", "1695": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> That's Sheldon.<br><strong>Dave:</strong> You're kidding! How's my hair?</br></p>", "1696": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I realized something. When Amy was in my life, I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And you don't want to make the same mistake with the next woman.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again.</p>", "1697": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, we're your best friends. Give us one more detail and we promise we'll leave you alone.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Fine. Umm ... he's British.<br/>\n(Penny and Bernadette squeal)<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> All right, that is a juicy one.</p>", "1698": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm gonna go look for other shoes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard.</p>", "1699": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So you're actually okay with invading your friend's privacy?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're not curious who she's out with?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not really.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> But you're curious about aluminum cans. You're a weird little guy.</p>", "1700": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Maybe you don't want someone exactly like you. You know what they say: opposites attract.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, by that logic, I should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh? Not to cast aspersions, but I can't shake a stick around here without hitting that.</p>", "1701": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> 60 seconds. This is not looking good.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> One minute is a long time.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I've been telling women that for 20 years.</p>", "1702": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, but this is violating university code.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> A little, but if I may quote Einstein, \"The pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Huh. All right, do it. Tell him we're in.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Done.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Before I answer, may I just say your skin has never looked better.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aren't you just made of sugar.</p>", "1703": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He has glasses and I'm a know-it-all. We are not built for prison.</p>", "1704": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me, Barry?<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Yes?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When can I stab one of my friends?<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> In fencing, we don't call it a stab. We call it a touch.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, yes, I'm aware. But if I say I want to touch one of my friends, I'll get called into Human Resources.</p>", "1705": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> My name is Little Orphan Annie. You killed my father. Prepare to die.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> My name is Darth Vader. I am your father. Prepare to die.</p>", "1706": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh-oh. According to this Mexican Customs Web site, visitors may not bring more than five laser discs, 20 compact discs or 12 VHS tapes.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> We don't have any of those.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How can you be sure? VHS was king when Feynman drove this van. For all we know, there are hidden compartments lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If there was a hidden compartment, don't you think you'd be stuffed in it by now?</p>", "1707": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard. You're not only the love of my life. You're my best friend. And you've got a friend in me. You got troubles. I got 'em too. There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you. We stick together and we can see it through, because you've got a friend in me.</p>", "1708": "<p><strong>Emily:</strong> Makes you feel alive, doesn't it? <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant, but here we are.</p>", "1709": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard, what time does your mom's plane get in?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. Sometime tomorrow morning.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Don't you want to know for sure?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace, I'll feel a disturbance in the Force.</p>", "1710": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you think the moms will get along?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. They're pretty different.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Maybe they'll be best friends. One of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple. <br/>\n*to Leonard* <br/>\nSound familiar?</br></p>", "1711": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I can't help but notice how her unconditional love for you is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement. A proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat.</p>", "1712": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'll take my chances.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. I wonder if they make \"I told you so\" cards in Braille.</p>", "1713": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hello, mommy.<br/><strong>Mrs.Koothrappali:</strong> Hello, Rajesh. What a nice surprise.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I've been thinking about you. Are you happy, mommy?<br/><strong>Mrs.Koothrappali:</strong> Such a sweet boy for asking. I can't believe you come from the poison seed of your father.</p>", "1714": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, how many people listen? <br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Most people download it later, but usually a few thousand people listen live. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What? A few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff? <br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Again, right in the ears, straight to the feelings.</p>", "1715": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Being left out is a terrible feeling. No one understands that better than I do.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, look at that. Even in your example, you're all by yourself.</p>", "1716": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Play that funky music, white boy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm surprised you know that reference.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What reference?</p>", "1717": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There it is. It's just a gate. On a road.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It wasn't even that hard to find.<br/><br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is so amazing!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know!</p>", "1718": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, Raj, if Howard can't keep the TARDIS, how great would it look at your place?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, what?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't know much about Doctor Who, but if you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back, it would be like your entire apartment is the inside of the TARDIS. Which is pretty cool because on the show, the inside of the TARDIS is bigger than the outside. But then again, I don't know much about Doctor Who.</p>", "1719": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You know, Amy, I can't help but wonder how Sheldon would react if the TARDIS was at your place.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't listen to her. Just hit the ball.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Keep talking.</p>", "1720": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did they hate it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, no, they loved it. They couldn't say enough nice things about it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So what's the problem?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know how the pennysaver only has my name on it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They didn't mention you in the article, only me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know. It's not fair. *massages Leonard's shoulders* Let the anger go, buddy. You just, you relax all your muscles, except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. Let's keep those going.</p>", "1721": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> All Ma's food is going to be ruined.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why don't we take it home and put it on our freezer?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You don't want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science.</p>", "1722": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All he had was an idea.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, that is an important part.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, please. I have ideas all day long: Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people; a new clothing size between medium and large called \"Marge\"; Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won't Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, Leonard's idea was good.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine, then Grumpy. What's he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won't take his side.</p>", "1723": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, have you ever noticed only my name is on the cable bill?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good, good. And your name is on the electric bill, and mine isn't. And I'm okay with that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Actually, your name is on the electric bill.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Right. This is a disaster.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't even know what you're talking about and I agree.</p>", "1724": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's not helpful.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I'd give more examples, but everyone in your position is so forgettable.</p>", "1725": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know shopping cheers you up, but it's not really my thing.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, how about this helicopter you control with an iPad?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Does it have a camera in it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It does have a camera in it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Baby's listening.</br></p>", "1726": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm the one who thought of it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, didn't he do a lot of the work?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But now he's happy to let everyone think he's responsible for everything.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And that's why you get an iPad helicopter.</p>", "1727": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> He always needs all the attention. He's such a baby.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know. I know.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I swear he is never playing with my helicopter.</p>", "1728": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey guys. I just want everyone to know tonight's not a sad occasion.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we've all had here so many times before.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Good food. Good friends. And, sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death.</p>", "1729": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't think I've eaten that much in my entire life.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's why my people wandered the desert for forty years. Took that long to walk it off.</p>", "1730": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes. I hung up.</p>", "1731": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I was unstoppable. I was on fire. It was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like athletes must feel when they're in the zone.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Again, it was miniature golf.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Admit it, you're a little turned on.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You can't be this proud.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Because I beat you.</p>", "1732": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I know, the person I'd most like to have dinner with is myself.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You sure that's your choice, because I've had that dinner.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I haven't. And although they say never meet your heroes, I just don't see how I could disappoint.</p>", "1733": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You may not be as academically inclined as are we. Yes, that's how you say it. But you possess an intelligence I envy, which leads me to my answer. I would choose the ability to read people's minds.</p>", "1734": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The whole thing reeks of blueberry. You know I can't stand these scented markers.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No one told you to taste them.</p>", "1735": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> This is good. Our idea is really good.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, the light bulb in this oven is ridiculously bright.</p>", "1736": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I'm just doing this awful work out. I hate it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well if you hate it, then why are you doing it? Although I could ask the same question about the coitus with Leonard.</p>", "1737": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Now you just get comfortable.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, no. Comfort is the enemy. You know what's comfortable? Slippers, and blankets, and panda bears. Oh, imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman's face on it!<br/>\nWarm up the car, Leonard. It's poster time.</p>", "1738": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I thought this was gonna be boring but it's actually kinda fun.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Don't tell Amy that; we'll be here every Sunday.</p>", "1739": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Here at Fun with Flags we've had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And, yes, even shed a tear or two.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular and it doesn't even get recorded.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How about four thousand? One for every domino I set up for that American Flag.</p>", "1740": "<p><strong>LeVar Burton:</strong> Thank you, Sheldon, now remember our deal.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You do this, I delete your contact information.<br/><strong>LeVar Burton:</strong> While...?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> While you watch me do it.</br></p>", "1741": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And if I may get serious for a moment. Hosting this show has been one crazy ride. With all its up and downs, I wouldn't give it up for the world. Except for now, when I'm giving it up.</p>", "1742": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I thought everybody liked me, but I'm just a monster.<br/><strong>Dan:</strong> But a cute one. Like that eyeball guy in Monsters Inc.<br/></p>", "1743": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's an earthquake. I knew it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, it's just a little tremor.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy.</p>", "1744": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How was your prom? Did you go?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, but I was on cleanup crew.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aw, that's sad.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, it was okay. The DJ let me dance one slow dance with my mop before he shut down. Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water, I still hear Lady in Red.</p>", "1745": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Was that a flask?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. I've decided to embrace all the traditions associated with prom, including spiking the punch.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're gonna put alcohol in the punch?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice. It's all the fun of high-school hijinks, with the self-protecting zip of anti-oxidants.</p>", "1746": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Or maybe, now that I'm no longer an out-of-work actress who can't pay for her own dinner, that makes you a little insecure.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can't believe you would say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.</p>", "1747": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, you're saying I don't do anything around here? Look at my chore chart!</p>", "1748": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well don't come crying to me when you don't get your allowance.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's not an allowance. It's a stipend! And we said we weren't going to call it an allowance in front of my friends.</p>", "1749": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wow, Raj, you were not lying about her.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I told you she exists!</p>", "1750": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, I wish Stuart would reopen, I hate this place, too.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, him I believe because he's an eighty-year-old man in a fifteen-year-old's t-shirt. You're just upset about Stuart, your mom and all their HBOs.</p>", "1751": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I've seen you guys ignore each other for hours, doing  totally different things.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's called parallel play.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, toddlers do that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not as well as we do.</p>", "1752": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I assume you want to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?<br/>\nMrs. Davis: You mean the dialogue that went \"Please? No. Please? No. Please? No.\"?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's the one. I believe you went last, so, please?</p>", "1753": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sherlock Holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, have you tried doing that?<br/>\nOfficer Hernandez: Nope.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, maybe you should. There's lots of books called Sherlock Holmes and there's no books called Officer Hernandez.</p>", "1754": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> We're engaged!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wow. I thought me having sex with Emily was going to be the big news.<br/>\n*Amy, Bernadette, Howard and Sheldon rush to Raj*<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, hey. What the hell?!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You guys propose all the time, this never happens.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're right. Yay!<br/>\n*Leonard &amp; Penny go to celebrate with Raj*</p>", "1755": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's nice that you called them esteemed.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're right, I'll take that out.</br></p>", "1756": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm gonna see where he is.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> How?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know his password so I can track his phone.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You do that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not always. But ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, I get worried.</p>", "1757": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> It actually sounds like he's doing pretty well.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I really think this is going to be for the best.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Me too. And he was able to take a sabbatical -<br/>\n*Amy starts hitting Leonard with a pillow*<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> How could you let him go!?</p>", "1758": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. The bisexual, gorilla, go-go dancer in Schindler's list is tough to beat.</p>", "1759": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on. How can you be sad when you're going home with all five foot six of this?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You think you're five foot six? That's funny.</p>", "1760": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay. So in the last twenty minutes we've seen a crazy woman kissing a foetus in a jar. We've seen a guy cut in half and sown to a fish.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.</p>", "1761": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> This maybe the biggest scientific breakthrough of our life time. How can you as a theoretical physicist not care about this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Maybe it's because I'm not an elitist. What I'd like to know is how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? Who's looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?</p>", "1762": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm excited to meet Emily.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I just hope he doesn't blow it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why would you say that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Because he's Raj. That's his thing. Beckham can bend it. Ralph can wreck it. Raj can blow it.</p>", "1763": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why did I pee before I decided to move in here?</p>", "1764": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My point is you're going to need to be careful. You used to be protected by your pre-enlightenment mythology. But now you're going to need a stronger friend, named latex.<br/><strong>Mary:</strong> Are you having the sex talk with me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well someone has to.<br/><strong>Mary:</strong> Oh, dear Lord.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, don't look to him. He's mad at you right now.</p>", "1765": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Is that book called \"Lies I tell to get sex\"?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Is that a real book? I would totally read that book.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Can I borrow it when you're done?</p>", "1766": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You've kissed like once in three years.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's true. Do whatever you want.</p>", "1767": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Amy, I could use some help.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Let me guess. There's an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.</p>", "1768": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> This is so much better than watching TV like a muggle.</p>", "1769": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'd like for at least one of us to see some action, so if you guys happen to have sex it's cool if she stays in the room.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Same goes for the two of you (Howard &amp; Bernadette) with Amy.</p>", "1770": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you for all your help.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Sorry if you didn't think we were taking it seriously. We love animals.<br/><strong>Yvette:</strong> Oh, do you guys own any pets?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Yvette:</strong> Good.</br></p>", "1771": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I already found a guy online who is willing to sell.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How do you know this isn't a sting operation set up by the Comic-Con police?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The same way I know the people in the TV set can't see me.</p>", "1772": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Those tickets were pretty expensive. I had to give Howie an advance on his allowance. Now he's never going to put his toys away.</p>", "1773": "<p><strong>James Earl Jones:</strong> Let me guess. You like Star Wars.<br/>\n*Sheldon nods*<br/><strong>James Earl Jones:</strong> You know I've been in other movies.<br/>\n*Sheldon nods*<br/><strong>James Earl Jones:</strong> But you don't care about those, do you?<br/>\n*Sheldon shakes his head*<br/>\n*James Earl Jones signals for Sheldon to come closer*<br/><strong>James Earl Jones:</strong> I have one thing to say to people like you. I like Star Wars too! Care to join me? </p>", "1774": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> On the bright side, every six year old there was jealous of my tiara. Not gonna lie, it felt good.</p>", "1775": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Since Sheldon isn't coming to Comic Con with us, why don't we dress up as some sort of trio?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Or we could just be the Fantastic Four and tell everyone that the Invisible Girl is standing right next to us.</p>", "1776": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, here's the deal. Sheldon is gone so the tree decorating rules are out the window.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Which means we don't have to use his ridiculous ornament spacing template.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And I'm happy to report its Kickstarter campaign is holding steady at $0.</p>", "1777": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I lived with her to save money.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, you didn't need to buy groceries because you were breast feeding.</p>", "1778": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Hey, babe.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey. Did you remember to pay the rent?<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Better. I used the money to buy these magic beans.</p>", "1779": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, I'm telling you I've done it. I clearly remember the cow standing up and then a cow on its side.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Were you drunk?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I was sixteen and in Nebraska, what do you think?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I think you're the one who fell over.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well that would explain why the sky was also on its side.</p>", "1780": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> You know what they say. Happy wife - Happy life. Let's eat!</p>", "1781": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I forgot about this (sweater). My aunt made it for me when I finished college.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aww, did she hate you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why because I got an ugly, itchy sweater and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite!</p>", "1782": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look, a new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow! I can't wait 'til I get a rash.</p>", "1783": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ooh, Gasex has a new ultra-strength. I guess they really do read their mail.</p>", "1784": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, isn't that Professor Proton?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, yeah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look at him just standing in line, like he wasn't moderately famous thirty years ago.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let's go say hello.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, maybe we shouldn't bother him.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not going to bother him. I'm going to talk to him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He thinks there's a difference.</p>", "1785": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Arthur! Arthur, it's me, Sheldon Cooper.<br><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  Trust me, I remember.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is television legend, Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  Hold on, you have a girlfriend?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes, and I've heard so much about you. Hey look, we're wearing the orthopaedic shoes. I can't believe I dress like a celebrity.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Okay, I get it now.</br></p>", "1786": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Excuse me, I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> How is that possible?</p>", "1787": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How do you not know how to use glue? Did you ditch pre-school?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, but only because I was dating a second-grader.</p>", "1788": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Look who's here to put the Jew in Jewellery night.</p>", "1789": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I hate to pile on the bad news, but I just got a raise.</p>", "1790": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I have some exciting news to tell you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That makes two of us. My new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business days. ... Come on, one.</p>", "1791": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It wasn't a pajama party. It was just a couple of bros hanging out, giggling, eating cookie dough and watching Princess Bride.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Please stop talking.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> As you wish. </p>", "1792": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you're hungry, I brought home mutton and coconut milk.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why'd you do that? You hate lamb.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was asking for directions. Apparently there was a communication problem.</p>", "1793": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My point is we're a couple and I like you for who you are - quirks and all.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I like you too.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I should hope so. I don't see anybody else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense.<br/>\n*Amy slams the door on Sheldon*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not even a goodbye? You see this is the kind of thing that makes people think you're weird. ... Poor kid. She just doesn't see it.</p>", "1794": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> There's chapters about potty training, bed wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it!</p>", "1795": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Is make-up really necessary?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> When somebody looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life, not like a body they just pulled out the river.</p>", "1796": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh my God! You did not just slow down for a bird! You know they fly, right?</p>", "1797": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You suck so hard!</p>", "1798": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> To the Neil-mobile!</p>", "1799": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Your husband's weird and his clothes are ridiculous.</p>", "1800": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> See what happens when you let girls play D &amp; D.</p>", "1801": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You're all wasting your time. Sheldon is the most qualified for the job. And no amount of gravity-defying bosom is going to change that.</p>", "1802": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where have you been?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Leonard, if I was prone to sarcasm I'd say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (Counts to 10 and takes a breath) What I meant was, gee Sheldon! You were gone a long time!</br></p>", "1803": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Some people are otters, some people are rocks.</p>", "1804": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Anyway I was hoping I could pick your brains a little. I'm supposed to take Lucy out Friday and I need a killer first date. <br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, evolutionary biology says that women are attractive to a man who is steady in the face of danger, so I recommend an unsafe environment. A seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks. Picnic near a lunatic asylum. A wine tasting on skid row.\n</p>", "1805": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Last time I was here, I was a scrawny little nerd.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And now you're also an astronaut.</p>", "1806": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We can't all be Cinderella.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Then how do we decide?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, it's simple. This was my idea. I'm driving. I'm Cinderella. You bitches got a problem with that, we could stop the car right now.</p>", "1807": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That would be ideal. If a person like that existed, I would sign on, no further questions asked.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Great. Here I am!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait. Here who is where?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Me. Aren't I your perfect roommate?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Um...<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Think about it, Sheldon. I'm not a stranger, we're both intellectually compatible, I'm willing to chauffeur you around town, and your personality quirks, which others find abhorrent and rage-inducing, I find cute as a button. What do you think?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Um.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Tell me one reason why this isn't a fantastic idea. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Um.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> See? You can't. I'm gonna go see if Leonard's room is big enough for my water bed.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Um.<br/></p>", "1808": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Feelings? What am I, a hippie at a love-in?</p>", "1809": "<p><strong>Kripke:</strong> You guys ever use any toys?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I do have a model rocket next to my bed.<br/><strong>Kripke:</strong> A rocket? You're a freak! I love it!</p>", "1810": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What kind of a person steals another person's car in broad daylight?\n<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?\n<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali's fault.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're right. (To Raj) Nice going.\n</p>", "1811": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy's taking me to a memorial service. It's for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he'll never make his way back to China.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That should lighten the mood.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What can I say? I put the fun in the funeral.</p>", "1812": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire.</p>", "1813": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So I can't wear my Silver Surfer necktie but you can wear a bathrobe?</p>", "1814": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> The tow truck didn't scratch your car.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> How do you know?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> 'cause I did it!</p>", "1815": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Problem, first time director?</p>", "1816": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Would you like me to help? I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> Thanks, but I can't afford je ne sais quois. How much for just quois?</br></p>", "1817": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, it's not exactly glamorous up there. The water that the astronauts drink is made from each other's recycled urine.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Must be nice. Nobody wants anything that comes out of me.</p>", "1818": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, does Sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, yes. According to the relationship agreement, on the anniversary of our first date, he must take me to a nice dinner, ask about my day, and engage in casual physical contact that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's hot. You kids better use protection.</p>", "1819": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> What kind of breakfast do you think they're going to give you in Russia?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> They invented blintzes. I'll be fine.<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> They invented the lightbulb in New Jersey. It doesn't mean they hand them out to you when you go.</p>", "1820": "<p><strong>Mr. Rostenkowski:</strong> It's gonna be okay, son.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You really think so?<br/><strong>Mr. Rostenkowski:</strong> Of course. A pretty girl like Bernadette, she'll find a new guy.</p>", "1821": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Well, it was either this or another hot tub party at George Takei's house.</p>", "1822": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Okay, I'll go. Howard, when I think about you and Bernadette starting this wonderful life together, I can't help but get a little choked up. I mean, look at you. You have everything. Look at me. I'm 37. I sleep in the back of a comic book store, and I have the bone density of an 80-year-old man. To Howard.</p>", "1823": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We're always the good guys. In D&amp;D, we're lawful good. In City of Heroes, we're the heroes. In Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Those women are prostitutes? You said they were raising money for stem cell research.</p>", "1824": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It will be like our World of Warcraft party a few years ago when the neighbors called the cops on us.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> They called the cops because of the smell. They thought we were dead.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> We were badass back in the day.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, let's do it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> 48 hours of Star Wars gaming.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's on like Alderaan.</p>", "1825": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You feel like trying something new for dinner? Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, let's talk about that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. But they do move more sluggishly when it's cold. So, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it's slow outside. I love my mind.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We all do. Now, how about dinner?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I would assume we'd enjoy insects or smaller lizards. We could also pull each other's tails off and grill them, they'll just grow back.</p>", "1826": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You may be from Texas, but I'm from New Jersey.</p>", "1827": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So this spring I get to go to the International Space Station.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh my word. A trip to the heavens. If you ever want to live there eternally, I've got a good book you can read.</p>", "1828": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> I am not abandoning you, Sheldon. Abandoning you is leaving you in a basket on a church doorstep. I am going to Hollywood and thank a wax Ronald Reagan for his service to our country.</p>", "1829": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> I want to thank you for the blessing that is my little Shelly. I also want to thank you for the continued strength not to coldcock him with my bible.</p>", "1830": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Mrs Cooper, it smells so good.<br><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> You take notes, darling. The real way to get a man is with melted cheese and cream of mushroom soup. He'll die at fifty, but his love will be true.</br></p>", "1831": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I study the brain, the organ reponsible for Beethoven's 5th Symphony. Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Light.</p>", "1832": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, pick a card.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Bippity-boppity-boo.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What's with the wand and the beep?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none of your business. Oh, excuse me, I'm getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick. Oh, look, my dry cleaning's ready. And your card was the five of spades. Ta-da.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> These cards have bar-codes on them. The wand is a reader. It's transmitting to your phone.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I said, ta-da. Show's over.</p>", "1833": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong>  Just keep in mind, should you ever need a slightly apathetic, tertiary friend, I stand at the ready.</p>", "1834": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hear me out. The atomic bomb was the Manhattan project, Windows 95 was Project Chicago, for our app I humbly suggest Project Nodlehs.<br/></p>", "1835": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You think Penny's right? Were we bullying Zack?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> No, I know bullying. He left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That happened to you?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know, I think we might owe the guy an apology.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So go apologize.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why me?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You started it, we just piled on.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What would I even say?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Zack, I'm sorry you're stupid. Have a Milk Dud.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> A Milk Dud?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I got a better idea. Were all responsible. I say we all go. Come on, who's with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're embarrassing yourself.<br/></br></p>", "1836": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's what I do with Howard. I'm much smarter than he is. But it's important to protect his manhood.</p>", "1837": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> May I point out to you all that the screening is first come, first served?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Relax, it's 5:00. The movie doesn't start till midnight.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Another way of saying that is: the movie starts at midnight and it's already 5:00. Let's go.</p>", "1838": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. So pay attention. Years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I have so many things to tell your biographer.</br></p>", "1839": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Do you believe you're going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?<br/><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Jews don't have hell. We have acid reflux.</p>", "1840": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I will give you the address if you go to my cousin's wedding with me.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> You're extorting a date out of me?<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> I kinda have to. The cousin who's getting married is the cousin I usually go to weddings with.</br></br></p>", "1841": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I haven't seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie. </p>", "1842": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm fine. How are you?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Menopausal.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Now I'm less fine.</p>", "1843": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Why didn't you tell me you're tapping my home girl? Did I say that right?</p>", "1844": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Where's your notebook?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Um, I don't have one.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How are you gonna take notes without a notebook?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I have to take notes?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How else are you gonna study for the tests?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> There's gonna be a test?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Tests.</p>", "1845": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> Do you want the regular peas or the Le Seur?<br><strong><strong>Howard:</strong></strong> Always Le Seur peas with lamb stew.<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> You're right. When you're right, you're right. What if they're out of the Le Seur?<br/><strong><strong>Howard:</strong></strong> Then get the regular!<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> All right, you don't have to yell.</br></p>", "1846": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Research Lab is more than just a game. It's like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real.</p>", "1847": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. Don't you have access to women who will do it for money?</p>", "1848": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Oh yes, canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way.</p>", "1849": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> I call my meemaw, Nana, and she's going to be very happy to hear my small rock kills your enchanted bunny.</p>", "1850": "<p><strong>Wolowitz</strong>: They're called tattoo sleeves. Put them on, have freaky sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery.</p>", "1851": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends!</p>", "1852": "<p><strong>Mrs. Cooper:</strong> By His hand we are all<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fed.<br/><strong>Mrs. Cooper:</strong> Give us, Lord, our daily<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Bread.<br/><strong>Mrs. Cooper:</strong> Please know that we are truly<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Grateful.<br/><strong>Mrs .Cooper:</strong> For every cup and every<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Plateful.<br/><strong>Mrs. Cooper:</strong> Amen. </p>", "1853": "<p>*Penny enters the apartment without knocking*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who is it? Hello, Penny. It's open, come in. Sarcasm.</p>", "1854": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Enough with the guilt, ma. We'll still see each other. I'll come over every night and have dinner with you.<br><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> The hell you will! What am I running here, a fancy restaurant? Does this look like the Olive Garden?</br></p>", "1855": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That was fast.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oh, the middle stall was occupied. I'll have to try again later.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in real estate, it's location, location, location.</p>", "1856": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> He said we should maybe enter you in the killer robot competition.</br></p>", "1857": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe, it's a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is that possible? I used to get those all the time. Even in church.<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Well, you know, if it is from a swirly, there's something I can do, okay. Circle, circle, dot, dot, now you have a cootie shot.</p>", "1858": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Who is it?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> It's Leonard.<br><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> You're gonna have to play outside. I'm not dressed to receive!</br></br></p>", "1859": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sheldor, back online.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> What's AFK?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> AFK. Away from keyboard.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I see.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What does that stand for?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> \"Oh, I see\"?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, but what does it stand for?</br></p>", "1860": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wanna catch me up?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, let's see. She attempted to open her apartment with her car key because her face is overly Midwestern. She hasn't had sex in 6 months, and she ate a fly.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh-huh. Seriously, 6 months?</p>", "1861": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon. Don't make that noise, it's disrespectful.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I should hope so. It was a snort of derision.</br></p>", "1862": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, I get it. I know how the world works. How about if I were to introduce you to the man who freed your people.<br><strong>Nurse:</strong> Unless my people were freed by Benjamin Franklin and his five twin brothers, you are wasting your time.</br></p>", "1863": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ladies and Gentlemen, honored daughters. While Mr. Kim by virtue of his youth and naivete has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank you.</p>", "1864": "<p><strong>Toby:</strong> Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm sorry?<br/><strong>Toby:</strong> The Phillipines: 1992: The Subic Bay Naval Station: A young boy on the cusp of manhood. His only companions, mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitoes. Desperate and alone, he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him to a merciful, loving God. But instead introduced him to a gin-pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he have but to drink, shoot, and snort his pain away?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't forget genetic predisposition towards addiction.<br/><strong>Toby:</strong> That's never been proven.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There have been studies.<br/><strong>Toby:</strong> Not double-blind studies!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How could there be double-blind study? Who would be the control group?</p>", "1865": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Howard, would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned: \"Me and My Girlfriend\"?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Uh oh, here comes \"The Talk\"!<br/>\n*Penny tries to blow up Howard's head.*</p>", "1866": "<p><strong> Sheldon:</strong> One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not one-on-one. One-on-one!</p>", "1867": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, let it go.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I shot you for a good reason. You were leading us into disaster.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was giving clear, concise orders.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You hid behind a tree yelling, \"Get the kid in the yarmulke! Get the kid in the yarmulke!\"</p>", "1868": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> I remember one summer when he was thirteen, he made a small nuclear reactor in the shed and told everybody he was going to provide free electricity for the whole town. Well, the only problem was he had no - what you call - fissionable materials. Anyway, when he went on the Internets to get some, a man from the government came by and sat him down - real gentle - and told him it's against the law to have yellowcake uranium in a shed.</p>", "1869": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Son of a bitch!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny's up<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You sick, geeky bastards!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How did she know it was us?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her bedroom closet.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> God this is going to be bad.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good bye, Honey Puffs. Hello, Big Bran.<br/></p>", "1870": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> New neighbor?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It seems so.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Significant improvement over the old neighbor.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.</br></br></br></p>", "1871": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of America Membership card?<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: It's been in every wallet I owned since I was five.<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: Why?<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: It says keep this on your person at all times.

That's prevening. </p>", "1874": "<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Ok, here you go Leonard.  One tequila sunrise!\n<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: Thank you!

In our ragtag of scientists with nothing to lose, I'm the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails, and that leaves you, by default, as the muscle.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> One more floor, and I'd be the pulled muscle.</p>", "1881": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So Sheldon, how's it feel to be beaten up by a girl?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not the first time.

Look at the beta function of quantum chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.</br></p>", "1892": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> At least Leonard, Howard and I would have always been friends.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> We talked about it, but Howard was in a pretty serious relationship ... with his mom.</br></br></p>", "1893": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A while ago YouTube changed from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I pretend I'm okay with this, but I'm not.</p>", "1894": "<p><strong>Priya:</strong> Would you like some homemade chili?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are there beans in it?<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Then it's not chili.

Leonard said I was crazy but I knew that carton felt lighter.</p>", "1896": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Can we go talk in the living room?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not wearing pajama bottoms.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I spilled grape juice.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, wear different pajamas.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't wear different pajamas.

The answer to the question, who made Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl? <br> <strong>Sheldon</strong>: Yes well I am polymerised tree saps and you are an inorganic adhesive so whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off me, returns on its original trajectory and adheres to you. <br> <strong>Leslie</strong>: Oh, ouch.</br></br></br></br></br></p>", "1902": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Ooh, the Philharmonic is playing Beethoven down town.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Before you say yes, it's not the movie about the big dog.</br></p>", "1903": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Buddy, I get that you're worried about me and I appreciate that, but I'm not going to die.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You don't know that.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> I do know that it won't be from an asteroid strike.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know who else said that?

That sounds like your type.</br></p>", "1906": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I guess we're going to have to do all the cooking.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I have a better idea.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> If you think you're going to get to me do all this by yourself, you're crazy.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I was going to get Raj to do it all by himself.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, well that's a great idea.</p>", "1907": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, Zack. Come on. You know neither of us thought this was real. I mean we were married by an Elvis impersonator.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Of course it was an impersonator.

And then maybe after, we can watch a dirty movie, and if I anybody has any questions about what happened or how, we can answer them.</p>", "1925": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We'll take you to the mall to get it done.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Why? I can do it right here.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really? You have a piercing gun?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No. All you need is a needle and an ice cube. I've done it, like, a dozen times.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, I don't know.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, come on. I'll be gentle. Let me take your ear virginity.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> This party's weird.</br></p>", "1926": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> I tried to read your paper, but it was very hard for me to understand.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, it's quite straightforward, actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Interesting. You can believe that, but God filling an ark with animals two-by-two is nonsense.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What did they feed the lions, Mother?<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> The floating bodies of drowned sinners, of course.</p>", "1927": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie, I love you.

Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper.\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it's gonna upset you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe in knowing my enemy, Leonard.

Would not Spy have followed Spy?</p>", "1935": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Sorry, dude.

Sheldon's pathologically afraid of birds. Hey, look, Sheldon. Birdie, birdie, birdie.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's it. Prepare for marshmallow death.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Eat flaming Nerf.</p>", "1936": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Your shoes are delightful, where did you get them?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> What?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Bazinga!

The guy is married!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, that's terrible.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And you, if you're so fine with how the way things are between us then why are you so jealous?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The important thing is he's married and that's terrible.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Nice save, genius.</br></p>", "1939": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'd like to have a talk about relationships.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You were supposed to have the talk with him.</p>", "1940": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Elevators, parks, movie theaters.

Thank you.</p>", "1942": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I think you'll appreciate this, very exciting.<br><strong>Dr. Gablehauser:</strong> Oh, what are you working on?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I've decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I'm going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert.<br><strong>Dr. Gablehauser:</strong> To what end?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, it's like the baseball movie, build it and they will come.<br/><strong>Dr. Gablehauser:</strong> Who will come?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The Jewish people.<br/><strong>Dr. Gablehauser:</strong> What if they don't come?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We'll make it nice, put out a spread.</br></br></br></br></p>", "1943": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She is a girl, who is a friend, but she is not, forgive me for doing this, (air quotes) \"my girlfriend\".</p>", "1944": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> On the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if the supercollider actually works, it'll create a black hole and swallow up the Earth, ending life as we know it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What a bunch of crybabies.

Of course if I buy them, I'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.<br/></p>", "1950": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> If anyone's interested, I'll be spending this Valentine's in the same way I spend every Valentine's.

Did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?</p>", "1952": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You want me to work with you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> <em>For</em> me!</p>", "1953": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you. It's mind-blowing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me. Spoiler alert.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I didn't spoil anything.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You told me it's mind-blowing.So, my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'm sorry.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Said the Grinch to Christmas.<br/></p>", "1954": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We're gonna have to stop at Pottery Barn on our way to work. I bought these Star Wars sheets, but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night's sleep. I don't like the way Darth Vader stares at me.</p>", "1955": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I hate trains.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, don't be silly.

I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport, but this? Lame-o!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, A, comic books employ story telling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17, 000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp.

I don't want to do that.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> What, and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminum can recycling?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> This is the movie Big Soda doesn't want you to see.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> No, it's the movie your wife doesn't want you to see.</br></br></br></br></br></p>", "1964": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, Penny, how's married life?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, it's good. I just wish Leonard would work up the courage to tell Sheldon he's moving in here.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You guys still aren't living together?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We are. I mean, he sleeps here. But it's only a matter of time before Sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows.</br></br></p>", "1965": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Amy, I noticed your status still says \"in a relationship\" on Facebook.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> You're right. I should probably let all of my Facebook friends know.<br/>\nPenny, I'm no longer in a relationship.</br></p>", "1966": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> If this was Star Trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, it's too broad of a beam. You'd need something more precise, like Superman's heat vision.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ooh, the Green Lantern's ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> If you need a green hand, why not just use the Hulk?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, please, the Hulk would never get across the border with that temper.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Guys, excuse me, not that calling one of the Avengers isn't a perfectly reasonable choice, but we're scientists. Don't you think we can figure this out using actual science?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, we could use science. But it's your bachelor party. Lighten up.</p>", "1967": "<p><strong>Mandy:</strong> Maybe you should talk to a therapist about this.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Too expensive.</p>", "1968": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wasn't Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> When your idiot brother redeems mankind, he can date whoever he wants.</p>", "1969": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Hello, caller, you are on with Penny and Wil from Serial Ape-ist 2.<br/><strong>Woman on phone:</strong> I don't have a question.

How?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We pretend we're aliens. We pretend we're aliens. I'm not the best at reading facial cues, but I'm gonna say that you love it and wanna hear more.</p>", "1975": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Did she say she didn't like you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Of course not. Nobody ever says they don't like you straight to your face.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Heh, we have led different lives!</p>", "1976": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hey, can I go to the bathroom?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Fine, just try not to look too alive.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> That's my jam.</p>", "1977": "<p> <strong>Leonard:</strong> So now let's bring out theoretical physicist, Dr, Sheldon Cooper. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, female children. Allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist. Polish-born, French-educated Madame Curie. Co-discover of radioactivity. She was a hero of science until her hair fell out, her vomit and stool became filled with blood, and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery. With a little hard work, I see no reason why that can't also happen to any of you. Are we done? Can we go? </p>", "1978": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe in a gender blind society like in Star Trek. Where women and men of all races and creeds worked side-by-side as equals.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You mean where they were advanced enough to develop an interstellar warp drive, but a black lady still answered the space phone?</p>", "1979": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, glasses off.

Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh's sister, so I high-tailed over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Amy, I'm fine.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You don't have to be strong for me. Now, let's talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch.</p>", "1986": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Raj! What are you doing?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> *raises coffee cup*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't think so. You've already had your allotted 6 ounces.

Leonard just left.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> I know. I wanna talk to you.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What would we talk about? We have no overlapping areas of interest, as I'm aware of.

This is the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just because.

All eleven pages of it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can't believe you saved all this stuff.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Of course I did, it's you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come here. ...

Don't you maniacs own a calendar?</p>", "2053": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I knew we should've never mentioned us living together in the first place.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> She was gonna find out eventually.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Disagree. We've known about evolution since 1859. She still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat.</p>", "2054": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> All right, you can open your eyes. I thought I'd let Harry Potter make things hotter.</p>", "2055": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is for you.

Do we know the father, or is this some Mamma Mia nonsense?</p>", "2058": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Maybe there are other things we have in common. Come dinner-time, do you enjoy eating food?</p>", "2059": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I can't eat like a ten-year-old all the time.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're dating somebody! Who is it?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What? What are you talking about?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You only watch what you eat when you're afraid you might have to take your shirt off.</p>", "2060": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My mother was at bible study. I walked in the house expecting to find it empty, and I heard a sound coming from my parents' bedroom. When I opened the door, I saw my father having relations with another woman.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's awful!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know. It's also why I never open a door without knocking three times. I mean, the first one's traditional, but two and three are for people to get their pants on.</p>", "2061": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Never leave a belt on the floor. At night, they look like snakes.</p>", "2062": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Apple slices? What kind of lunatic goes to McDonald's and gets fruit?</p>", "2063": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, my boss said he hadn't decided yet, so I gently reminded him that he's an old rich white guy, and I'm a sweet little pregnant lady who's not afraid to cry in front of a jury.</p>", "2064": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'd love it if my dad could come.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, you have to invite him. I haven't seen him since the divorce.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, he's like a different man. He stopped twitching, and I think he grew an inch and a half.</p>", "2065": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> I've always had a special place in my heart for Leonard. Taking care of my baby all these years.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me, I take care of him.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Sure you do.</p>", "2066": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Whew, chilly.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I think I can see my breath.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> We can hear you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sorry.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sorry.</p>", "2067": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Helium.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Taylor Swift.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes.

I'm preparing to write a book on high-achieving couples, and I would love to interview the both of you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, sure. I'll talk to Sheldon about it. You know, Bernadette's husband is a former astronaut.<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> Really? Do you think he would be interested in being interviewed as well?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Do I think he'd be interested? Sometimes I hear him pretending to be interviewed when he's alone in the bathroom.<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> Wonderful. I'll give you my contact information.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Um, you should probably talk to Penny, too.<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> About what?</p>", "2072": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Penny?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, Zack, hi. You guys remember Zack?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, hey, buddy.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Hey, did you two get married?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We did.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, mmm-hmm.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> To each other?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Cool. 'cause other than when you broke up with him and dated me, then broke up with me, and then dated me one more time before going back to him, I was always rooting for you two.</p>", "2073": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn't like a party.</p>", "2074": "<p><strong>Leslie Winkle:</strong> Uh, in the past, I would've said something obnoxious, like, \"Happy birthday, dumbass\".

Say it.<br/><strong>Leslie Winkle:</strong> Happy birthday, dumbass!</p>", "2075": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I can't think of anything to say that hasn't already been said.

You gotta be kidding me?</p>", "2076": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. I mean, how do you prepare for something like this? I'm not even sure I've held a baby before.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, it's okay, you'll figure it out.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But how's this all gonna work? Do we get a nanny? I mean, can we afford a nanny? And if we can, we can't get a pretty one, 'cause it'll wreck our marriage.<br/>\nWe can't get an ugly one, 'cause it'll scare the kid.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't know, Howie.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Are we in a good school district? You're Catholic, I'm Jewish. What religion do we raise it? And if it's a boy, do we get him circumcised? People say it's barbaric, but if we don't, it looks like a pig in a blanket.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Calm down, it's gonna be okay.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> How's it gonna be okay? Look at me, I'm a mess. And that means this baby's gonna half a mess. And that's even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny.</p>", "2077": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's going on?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm, uh uh, gonna be a father.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What? Congratulations.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's so amazing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why \"oh, no\"?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because this changes everything. What about comic book night? Uh, what about playing games together? What about our trips to Disneyland? How can we do those things with a child around?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Relax, there's room for two babies in this group.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, dear L- Penny's pregnant, too?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're the other baby.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, really? Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I guess we'll call this a draw.</p>", "2078": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It'll be fine. People have kids every day. You'll figure this out.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're right, it is, I'm just a little overwhelmed right now.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, you know what we should do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All get vasectomies so this doesn't happen to us?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Go out and celebrate. But not your worst idea.</p>", "2079": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This place is terrific. Why have we never been here before?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The same reason we don't do a lot of fun stuff - you.</p>", "2080": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How could you do that?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm sorry, but you know what it's like when you're with your man and one thing leads to another.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I do know what that's like. I really do.</p>", "2081": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How are you doing? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, wonderful. I'm being musically encouraged to bust a move. If I knew what that meant, I might just do it.</p>", "2082": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up, didn't you start dating someone right away? <strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I ... I wouldn't say right away.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And actually, it was three different men.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Three different men?!

Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.</p>", "2084": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> That's great. And look at you, sitting in Sheldon's spot. You know, I don't even get to sit there.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah. And you never will.</p>", "2085": "<p><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Thank you, Moon Pie.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Uh, I'm curious. Why do you call Sheldon \"Moon Pie?\"<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> 'Cause he's so nummy-nummy.<br/>\nLeonard and <strong>Penny:</strong> She could just eat him up.</br></p>", "2086": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You have an engagement ring?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Penny, did you know about this?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, let's go.</p>", "2087": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know how, when you're sick, you're allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people's feelings don't matter?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Ooh. Gentle and loving. This is gonna be tricky.</p>", "2088": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behavior. I hope that you can accept my apology.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Of course I do.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And, Emily, I'm sorry for saying dermatologists aren't real doctors. And I'm sure you're tired of hearing that.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces-<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay! Okay, the point is that we accept your apology.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Uh, maybe you do. He just insulted me again.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, but he doesn't mean it.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Why are you defending him?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe I can answer that. Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy.<br/>\nNow, why don't you accept my apology, receive your free T-shirt, uh-- I hope extra small is okay. For some reason Wolowitz took a medium.</p>", "2089": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You think they'll still go on the trip?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All I know is after the fight I went to Emily's to smooth-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> They're not going on the trip.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.</p>", "2090": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up, you could ask if she's heard about the drug.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What if I get caught?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Fear of failure!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Lack of confidence!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Kind of a wuss!</p>", "2091": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fine, I'll do it. But not because of them, because I love you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Pushover.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Spineless.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Still hasn't bought milk even though I told him two days ago!</p>", "2092": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> How can I not sound like his mother when our entire bedroom is filled with Star Wars toys? I mean, have you ever had sex with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?<br/><strong>Dr. Gallo:</strong> I went to college in the '70s; it was a hairier time. I'm gonna say yes.</p>", "2093": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thursday can't get here soon enough. I'm taking off work to watch the original trilogy while I eat enough Star Wars cereal to choke a wookie.</p>", "2094": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sweetie, you do realize Thursday is Amy's birthday?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And you do realize I bought my ticket when Amy and I were broken up. I hope you didn't need anything in that case, because it's closed.</p>", "2095": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In the past, you've come to me when I was struggling with a dilemma.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> And the one time when you were afraid and you needed me for a night light.</p>", "2096": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Which do you think she'll prefer? Because I checked the Sheep and Wool website and there's only 8,000 tickets left.</p>", "2097": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, not that. I understand the mechanics.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Oh, good. Good. 'cause I have no idea what kids these days are calling their parts.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think they say \"junk.\"<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> What is happening to this world?</p>", "2098": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> I was just curious. How'd it go?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It was amazing. I saw it a few days later. What a movie!<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> What about Amy?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, she liked it fine, but she doesn't have the history with the franchise like I do.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Okay. Good talk.</p>", "2099": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sheldon Cooper's descent into madness day two. It's 2:25 a.m. and I feel the urge to urinate. My normal urination time is 7:10 a.m., but here I am, in the middle of the night, struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry. It's only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades. I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is.</p>", "2100": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, they were no help at all.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service.</br></p>", "2101": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hi, Dave. Uh, it's Amy.<br/><strong>Dave:</strong> Oh. How are you?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm fine. How are you?<br/><strong>Dave:</strong> Terrific. And pleasantly surprised to hear from you, given how I acted on our last date.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know. I took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend like he was Leonard Nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend.</p>", "2102": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Can you please go talk to him?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, I take care of him all day long. You do it for once.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you want, a medal? It was your gum.</p>", "2103": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to Siri without pressing any buttons?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No. How does it work?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You just say, uh, \"Hey, Siri, what time is it?\"<br/><strong>Siri:</strong> The time is 6:37 p.m.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So now anyone can control your phone? Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Nice try. It only recognizes my voice.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, cool. (Imitates Raj): Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't sound like that.<br/><strong>Siri:</strong> Here are some images of naked grandma butts.</p>", "2104": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> But it is basic human nature. If we present him as a prize, maybe they would.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, he's smart, he's a respected scientist-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know if I'd say you - Oh.</p>", "2105": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why'd you bring him?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I had to. We're married now.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Ugh, I hear that.</p>", "2106": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey. You got a minute?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Not really. Visigoths are kind of up my butt right now.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Pause the game, Howard.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> \"Howard?\" Uh-oh. Make room, Visigoths.</p>", "2107": "<p><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> You know, I know you don't want to hear this, but it wouldn't take that much work to turn that den into a nursery.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why wouldn't I want to hear it?<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> 'Cause Bernie said you didn't want kids.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's not true at all. I wish she'd get pregnant, believe me. I'm climbing on top of her every chance I get.<br/>\nIn a loving and respectful manner.</p>", "2108": "<p><strong>Dealer:</strong> But you ain't getting your money back.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're taking advantage of us? We clarified nomenclature together.<br/><strong>Dealer:</strong> Look, I enjoy semantic digressions as much as the next guy, but, uh, this is business.</p>", "2109": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It says right here on Wikipedia, \"A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties.\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How can you trust Wikipedia if they use \"between\" to refer to three parties?<br/><strong>Dealer:</strong> They should've used \"among,\" right?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Or \"amongst,\" if they were feeling whimsically archaic.<br/><strong>Dealer:</strong> All right, enough with the chitchat. Are we gonna watch Ernest Goes to Jail or not?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Absolutely. But don't be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow.<br/><strong>Dealer:</strong> I am open to change.</p>", "2110": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, we've always talked about playing together.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, it could be fun to try a little acoustic thing.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, we could play \"filk\" music.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> What's that?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's been around for years. It's like folk music, but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I like it. It sounds exactly like something I shouldn't be expected to pay for.</p>", "2111": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, and here's the hook.<br/>\n\"Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning. The other plays with bones.\"</p>", "2112": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hi, Mom.<br/>\nHow are you doing? Oh, good.<br/>\nHow's work? That's nice.<br/>\nI'm fine.<br/>\nHey, listen, I've been meaning to ask, how come Aunt Doe and Aunt Florence never got along?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, just give me that. Amy broke up with Sheldon, she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies!<br/>\nHang on. She wants to talk to you.</p>", "2113": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> (watching Fun with Flags) I'm going to kill him.</p>", "2114": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I don't want to rush you, but I'm closing a little early tonight.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ooh, hot date?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Uh, no. I overheard Bernadette tell Howard she was making him a meatloaf, and you don't have to not ask me twice.</p>", "2115": "<p><strong>Emily:</strong> If I stick a light bulb on this, will it make a great lamp for my bedroom?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> You're kidding, right?<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Oh, is this freaking you out? <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I guess I'm just more of a Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel kind of guy. Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.</br></p>", "2116": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, good. You're here. I need your assistance. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?</p>", "2117": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know, guys. Maybe this relationship isn't for me. Maybe I should break up with her. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Right. You're gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you. Can you believe this guy?</p>", "2118": "<p><strong>Emily:</strong> You aren't scared, are you? <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Of ghosts, no. Of you, little bit.</p>", "2119": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I shouldn't have asked so many questions. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, it's okay. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, maybe it's good you got us talking about this stuff. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, look at that. Even when I'm causing problems, I make the world a better place.</p>", "2120": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? We're committed to each other. We're happy. A ceremony isn't gonna change anything. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So you're never getting married? It's his whining, isn't it? <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, I'm not a whiner. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's amusing that he doesn't hear it.</p>", "2121": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, you've been living here a while now. <br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I know. I may sell comic books at work, but the real superheroes are sitting right in front of me. <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah... <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> His middle name is David. Go.</p>", "2122": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, I'm not happy this happened, but I think I can get past it. I mean, we weren't engaged at the time, and it was just kissing. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Right. Just kissing. It wasn't even very good. She was a smoker. I'd just been seasick... <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, that's enough. Stop talking.</p>", "2123": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, your mom's never been too thrilled with our relationship. Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If you could run out and get a PhD, that might make her like you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? It didn't work for you.</p>", "2124": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> She's just a very sweet and God-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs. <br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Leonard, I am an adult. I know how to conduct myself around people from different walks of life. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you. <br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Where is she from again? <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> East Texas. <br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Ugh.</p>", "2125": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, Mom, you haven't seen Penny since we got engaged. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, let me show you the ring. <br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oh, lovely. Must have been very expensive.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no, not at all. No, we found a place online that repurposes diamond drill bits. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We did not. That's not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, sure. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It came from Tiffany's. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You mean the box, right? <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Keep walking!</p>", "2126": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You're like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers! <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as \"super weaning\"? <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, you are a super weaner!\n</p>", "2127": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> His name is Sigmund Freud.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey! Look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.<br><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Stay out of this.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh-huh.</br></br></p>", "2128": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, can you get it working? <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm an MIT-trained engineer. I've built components for the space station. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn't work. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It worked fine. It just wasn't designed for Russian cosmonauts and their potato-ba<x>sed diet.</x></p>", "2129": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So I have a dominant personality. We all know that. <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm sorry. What do we know? <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> In social groupings, I just naturally wind up in charge. <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Don't take this the wrong way, but how many of these little booze balls have you had?</p>", "2130": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A select group of scientists were invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman, and I wasn't included.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aww. Sheldon, I'm sure it's not because they don't think you're an elite scientist.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, I'd bet you anything. It's just because you're a pain in the ass.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're just saying that to make me feel better.</br></p>", "2131": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Can you please pass the salt?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sure. It's not like I was invited to Richard Feynman's house and having anything better to do.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Is this how the rest of the night's going to be?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know the future.</p>", "2132": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, it applies to you, too. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was afraid you might bring this up, so I have a work-around. *puts a picture of his face in front of his real face* There you go. As far as you're concerned, I'm smiling. Although, I must admit, I'm smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant.</p>", "2133": "<p><strong>Kevin Smith:</strong> So, Penny, listen, I saw your movie. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, wow. I wish it was better. <br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Oh, don't worry about it. Have you seen some of Kevin's films? <br/><strong>Kevin Smith:</strong> You're cruisin' for a beatin', Wheaton.</p>", "2134": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm surprised you could hear me with this Thin Mint in your ear! *takes a Thin Mint from behind Josh's ear* Yeah, pretty cool, huh? <br/><strong>Josh:</strong> Yeah. Anyway, I should probably get going. <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie, have you noticed how often people say that when you start to do magic?</p>", "2135": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, look, would it make you feel better if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie? <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That would be great, thank you! <br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> I'm just going to jump in here real quick. Leonard, a moment ago, you were dead set against Penny resuming her acting career, but now you're all for it. Is it fair to say that she played you like a violin? <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, it is, Wil.</p>", "2136": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What do you want to do? <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. I... I'd just like him to go away. I can't deal with this.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> All right, I've got your back. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thank you. Come on. And I'd like to point out this wall just provided a lot of privacy!</p>", "2137": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What is the harm if I audition? <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, what if you get it? <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't know, I make a movie, we could become rich and famous, win an Oscar, a Golden Globe and live an incredibly wonderful life. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> From a Kevin Smith movie?</p>", "2138": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or \"fort off,\" are Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Sumter and... Fort Cozy McBlanket.</p>", "2139": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'd say Knox over Ticonderoga 'cause it's got the gold, and McBlanket over Sumter 'cause it has a higher thread count.</p>", "2140": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> For those of you listening at home. How great is this?</p>", "2141": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, ten o'clock. Date night's over.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What? No. We haven't picked a winner.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> We both know this one's gonna win.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, of course we do. Fort Knox doesn't have a secret physics lending library.</p>", "2142": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I just restocked the old PRK.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> PRK?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Public Restroom Kit. Everything a boy needs for making pee-pee in new and strange places.</p>", "2143": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't see what's crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Keep going.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And rubber gloves, and air freshener. Noise cancelling headphones. Oh, danger whistle. Umm, pepper spray. Ooh, a multi-language occupied sign. Let's see, we have seat protectors, booties for my shoes, a clothes pin for my nose. Oh, and, a mirror on a stick so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn't some kid of weirdo.</p>", "2144": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I had one too, but I didn't have any friends so all I did was serve.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You know you can leave one side up and play against it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And if I had a friend, they might have told me that.</p>", "2145": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm so excited. And I just can't hide it.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh. I'm about to lose control. And I think I like it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What are you talking about?</br></p>", "2146": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So when do you guys think you're gonna move in?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We're still figuring how much remodelling we want to do.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's tricky finding the right balance between tasteful modern and Jewish mother chachki crap fest.</p>", "2147": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Ooh, you just chose champions. It's like we're re-enacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Leonard makes you watch that, too?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, I like that show. It's got dragons and people doing it.</p>", "2148": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy. But one quest at a time.</p>", "2149": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's the plan?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm just gonna be honest with the guy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Honesty will never get us in.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, what's your plan.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right. My plan is predicated on the assumption they have a nurse's office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.</p>", "2150": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Shedding the yoke of my oppressors, you blind, sad little man.</p>", "2151": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> One question about that picture. Can it be with George Lucas? Ooh, grumpy you are.</p>", "2152": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> And just so you know, when this started I was going to put the TARDIS in a discreet corner of the house. But I've since turned mean and now it's going in the middle of the living room on a rotating platform with a sign that says \"Suck It\".</p>", "2153": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Did you play badminton or sadminton?</p>", "2154": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And that, little lady, is Pi to a thousand places.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'd say sorry I asked, but I didn't.</p>", "2155": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I know what it's like having to go through a loved one's possesions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died, you know what we found? A statue of Shiva.<br/>\nIt might not be Crips &amp; Bloods, but in India it's a thing.</p>", "2156": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> A lot of ma's stuff brings back fond memories.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Is that why you couldn't get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes. It reminds me of us eating out, and her saying \"Quick, no one's looking, fill your pockets with ketchup.\"</p>", "2157": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> It's all defrosting.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's okay, it's just food.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's not just food. This is the last food my mother ever made. This is her last brisket. This is her last meatloaf. This is her last - I have no idea what this is. But, it's the last one.</p>", "2158": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What should we do?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'll tell you exactly what we're gonna do. We're gonna eat it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> There's like twenty-pounds of food in there.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> All you said was, I had to get rid of things. You didn't say they couldn't pass through my colon first.</p>", "2159": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Congratulations. Who would've thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family.</p>", "2160": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh dear lord. Oh dear lord.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> It's okay. We made it. We're fine.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That was a lot of puppies.</br></p>", "2161": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I got you something for Valentine's Day and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because I got it at the dirty store.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You went to the dirty store without me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> In sun glasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.</p>", "2162": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh no, oh no, oh God, no.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know what? You sound busy. I'm going to let you go.</p>", "2163": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, what do you think?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I thought it would be a little more ... just more.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm not even sure why we were out of breath.</p>", "2164": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Did we move at all?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe a long the Z axis, but X &amp; Y are looking pretty sad.</p>", "2165": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Now come on, we are gonna do this.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. You get the paint, I'll rest for thirty to forty minutes, and then we do this.</p>", "2166": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No one told you to poke the turtle's face.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was playing \"Got your nose\". That's how you get children to like you.</p>", "2167": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This again. Amy, I've already had one new hole torn in my body today, I don't need another one.</p>", "2168": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was going to make you a red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet I went for peppermint.</p>", "2169": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> During the seven month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humor. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You mean this weirdly suspicious one?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. Open it and check.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't get it. There's actually peanut brittle in-<br/>\n*Sheldon throws a pie at Leonard*</p>", "2170": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I mean I was on fire. I was in the zone like an athlete.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.</p>", "2171": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What I want is for us to be planning our future together.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because I've seen people make the long distance thing work.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> We're on the same planet!</p>", "2172": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I guess we'll have to make a new video together as a couple.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good idea. And as you've had such a rough day, I'm gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard's face.</p>", "2173": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you for forgiving me.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> It's okay. At some point we were bound to have our first fight.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, it almost happened when you called my Apple Pie crust doughy. But the truth is, you were right and I was just angry at myself.</p>", "2174": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't need science to win her heart, I have my family's wealth for that.</p>", "2175": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just out of curiosity, Penny, if this experiment does make us fall in love, would you drive me to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, for Gary-Con. It's the only convention celebrating the life and work of Gary Gygax, the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> You know what, I can honestly say if we fall in love, not only will I drive you there, I will buy you all the dragon t-shirts you want.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, babe, let's do this.</br></p>", "2176": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Given the choice of anyone in the world, who would you want as a dinner guest?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can honestly say Penny.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Aww, then I choose a janitor, because I'm about to throw up.</p>", "2177": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Are you kidding me? You lost my mother's ashes?<br/><strong>Airline worker:</strong> No, I'm just saying that sometimes bags are misrouted.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, where did you misroute the only woman who ever loved me? The first woman - I meant first.</p>", "2178": "<p><strong>Emily:</strong> There's one downtown where they trap you in a room with a zombie.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, so kinda like what's happening with Penny right now.</p>", "2179": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We spent $200 on six minutes of fun.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's like when we bought that remote-controlled helicopter and it just flew away.</p>", "2180": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why don't we go get the food for the party?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Smart. Looks like we're being helpful.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> When really we're just exiting an uncomfortable situation. *fist bumps with Raj*</p>", "2181": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> If he's not nice, it's gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> The guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk, we still watch Game of Thrones.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I was distracted. It's weird seeing a member of the Night's Watch with a kayak strapped to his car.</p>", "2182": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hang on. If you're really Nathan Fillion, what's the line from Firefly about your bonnet?<br/><strong>Customer:</strong> I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's it. That's the line.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Although, I knew the line, doesn't make me Nathan Fillion.</p>", "2183": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You're building a particle detector using super-fluid helium.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, when you talk like that, I want to take you right here on this table.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And you know from past experience, this table can not support both our weight.</p>", "2184": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> \"My good sir. We are neither crackpots, nor wannabes. In fact, we are experts in our fields. And while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. And later tonight, your mother.\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You don't think that's too rough?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We're just standing behind her. It's not like we're gonna say \"Boo!\" and scare her.</p>", "2185": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, whichever rep has the best sales for the quarter gets a trip for two to Hawaii.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That would be so romantic for you and Leonard.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, clearly you haven't seen him on the beach walking around with his metal detector.</p>", "2186": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I want you to take that cap off.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That nagging tone is helping my anxiety. But if you could maybe go 10% less shrill, that would really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah.</p>", "2187": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, what are you trying to pull? The President of Science isn't in here.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You lie down, he'll be here in a minute.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. I thought you were trying to trick me.</p>", "2188": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> It's not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right? Some bald guy with horns isn't going to rip my heart out?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Dude, that movie's an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of blood thirsty barbarians.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You love that movie.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, it's pretty great.</p>", "2189": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> As a scientist you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence. And now you're counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That is so offensive. Does everything you know about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, there's also Apu from The Simpsons.</p>", "2190": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Is there anything I should know before I go in?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Like what?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Like am I dressed okay?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really? So every other place you've been, you thought this was fine?</br></p>", "2191": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why would you have surgery?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because I can't breathe. I snore. I get sinus infections.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Back off, he's all mine.</p>", "2192": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I'm really impressed you're willing to try this.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat, small places, going below floor level, dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes, and eliminating in Home Depot buckets. That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling that's going to rocket to the top of the list.</p>", "2193": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, I didn't think you'd make it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Because you have a steady girlfriend now and we assumed you'd have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit.</p>", "2194": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So I've been trying to come up with a cute couple's nickname for me and Emily. What do you like better \"Emipalli\" or \"Koothrapemily\".<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why is it your last name and her first name?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, her last name is Sweeny, and something just didn't seem right about Koothrapeeny.</p>", "2195": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're not working. How'd you like a job in home healthcare?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Not a chance.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Please, I'm desperate.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'll pay anything you want.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay then, yeah.</p>", "2196": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> This is so sweet. You never cook for me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, you cook for me all the time and eugh.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> If you don't like my cooking, why haven't you ever said anything?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, it's hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.</p>", "2197": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, should we talk about setting a date?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I'd like to choose one that works with my brother's schedule.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Right and when would that be?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Twelve to eighteen months from now, depending on good behavior.</p>", "2198": "<p>*As Stuart moves a box, a piece of the ceiling falls down*<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> That could have killed me. ... Can't catch a break.</p>", "2199": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't take this the wrong way, but did you do this for the insurance money?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> No! God, you sound like the police, the fireman, my parents, my therapist and the insurance company.</p>", "2200": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> If she isn't going to use it, why are we doing this?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She'll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a honey-baked ham.</p>", "2201": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> *Laughs* Very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know.</p>", "2202": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Wow, that fell apart really fast.</p>", "2203": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So how many tattoos?<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> One on my shoulder. One not on my shoulder. And one really not on my shoulder.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's been a long time since I've seen a girl's really not her shoulder.</p>", "2204": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> This would have been so much more romantic if you didn't have gorilla hair on your fingers.</p>", "2205": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> We'll be right back after I fire my writers.</p>", "2206": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> We were hoping it might cheer you up.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> And even though it meant we had to miss the movies, we could still be part of the fun.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, you didn't miss anything. We just started over.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Son of a bitch.</br></p>", "2207": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So we're just randomly choosing a restaurant without researching it online?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yep.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Great. This is how Anything Can Happen Thursdays turns in to It Won't Stop Coming Out Friday.</p>", "2208": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It suggests I set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas.</p>", "2209": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I promise I'll be on my best behavior.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.</p>", "2210": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Well, I've certainly taken some jobs I've been embarrassed by.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I wouldn't exactly call Star Trek embarrassing.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> I wasn't.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Me either.<br/></p>", "2211": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> How's it going?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Good. Sheldon's out of town so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn't like.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> How is it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Disgusting. Do not tell him.</p>", "2212": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can you recommend a surface you haven't had coitus on?<br/><strong>Mary:</strong> That's not funny. ... Maybe we should sit at the table.</p>", "2213": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Thanks for walking me to my car.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Actually it's for both of us. Last night I watched Westside Story and I'm a little freaked out by streetgangs.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why can't Raj find a girl? The mystery continues.</p>", "2214": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey. Good news, somebody in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Fine. Can I at least shower first?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, not that. Although you already agreed to it, so no takebacks.</p>", "2215": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk costumes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You were all going as the Hulk?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Not the same Hulk. Ferrigno, Bana, Norton and Ruffalo.</p>", "2216": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm serious. Who wants to do all that stuff? Have insurance, pay mortgages, leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I told you it was Penny.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh come on. It wasn't me. Anybody could have knocked your mirror off. Or whatever happened.</p>", "2217": "<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> How about you, Stu? Mocha, scone, directions to the nearest soup kitchen?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey!<br/><strong>Jesse:</strong> I'm just kidding. He knows where this soup kitchen is.</p>", "2218": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> He made you his screensaver.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, wow. I had no idea. He is so into me!</p>", "2219": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> There's also a time to stop eating so many jelly beans. And it's when you're ten!</p>", "2220": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't need to sit here and take this, Flatow. It's because of bullies like you that everyday more and more Americans are making the switch to television.</p>", "2221": "<p>*Amy walks into the kitchen where Raj and Bernadette are preparing dinner*<br><strong>Amy:</strong> You need any help?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, can you reach that gravy boat up there?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Great, that makes one of you.</br></p>", "2222": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Can I tell her she looks nice?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Can I tell her I miss her?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Maybe, if she asks.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Can I show her an oil painting I made of us surrounded by our children and grand-children.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'd save that for the second date.</p>", "2223": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Come on, he's a retired kids show host.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. ... Pervert.</p>", "2224": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  Sheldon, what are you doing here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, did I wake you?<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  Of course you woke me, it's seven thirty.</p>", "2225": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I would have been here sooner but for some reason your home isn't on this map of Hollywood stars.</p>", "2226": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I was going to make a necklace for my mom but unfortunately she doesn't have a neck. She's just chins and fat and feet.</p>", "2227": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You can't tell her what she can or can not do.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Last week you told Leonard he couldn't wear his wookie jacket out in public.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's different. I'm not going to the mall with somebody dressed like a dumb space bear.</p>", "2228": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I thought Amy was going to drive you home.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I thought so too, but she's acting very strangely. I was discussing it with a Sri Lankan fella on the bus. He hypothosized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow. Although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brother-in-law's witchdoctor practice.</p>", "2229": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, I've known you a long time. I'm going to tell you this with all the love I can possibly muster. Amy's right, you're wrong.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But you don't even know -<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It doesn't matter.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But in my defence -<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Doesn't matter!</p>", "2230": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What does tweepodoc mean?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Elephant?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Lucky guess.<br/></p>", "2231": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I want you to be happy, too. But not enough to do anything about it.</p>", "2232": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You know, one of the things that helped me get through Howard being in space for so long was getting married before he left.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.</p>", "2233": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Excuse me, but I'm a neurobiologist. I think I'm a little more qualified to understand what's not working in your girlfriend's brain.</p>", "2234": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that stinks. No wonder you got cancelled. Bye.</p>", "2235": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturizing regimen.</p>", "2236": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, you do what you want. But I don't want to lose my friends over tenure. Friends are forever.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> *Coughing* So is tenure.</br></p>", "2237": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> It's ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these stairs.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, try doing it in heels.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I am.</p>", "2238": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Set your phasers to stun. If we vaporize Penny, I'll never get a girlfriend that pretty again.</p>", "2239": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, a scroll. I like scrolls. They're my third favourite system of transmitting the written word, after stone tablets and sky-writing.<br/>You have all been summoned to join a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure. Your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred. I like where this is heading. Your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres. Oh, that's a saucy twist. That leader's name: Santa Claus.<br/>No, no, no!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Its actually ho, ho, ho, but you'll get the hang of it.</p>", "2240": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest. What do you do? And, Howard, do not say, I feel up the large chest.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Excuse me. I'm a married man now. I wasn't going to say anything so juvenile.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Great. What do you do?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go blublublublublublublublu!<br/></p>", "2241": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Listen, Sheldon. I'm really happy to do this for you, but not if she's going to be a huge pain in the ass the whole time.</p>", "2242": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, Howie, how you feeling?<br ?=\"\"/><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Better. Much better. The other astronauts held me down, gave me a shot. Oooh. Attention, people of Earth. Tonight, there will be two moons in the sky.\n<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie, stop that. NASA's watching this! Put your pants back on!</br></p>", "2243": "<p><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> If I die, promise me you'll never have sex with another man.</p>", "2244": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Let's go see if you fit in my man purse.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Metrosexual, my ass.<br/></p>", "2245": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins. Slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home.</p>", "2246": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There it is again! Do you feel that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The growing realization that you are one wacky bastard? Yes.</p>", "2247": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Rise and shine sleepy head, half the town probably is dead.</p>", "2248": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.</p>", "2249": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Hun, you think maybe the reason why you're having trouble finding a guy to settle down with, is because you're letting them ride the roller-coaster without buying a ticket?</p>", "2250": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh, I so should have taken you to Houston.</p>", "2251": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> Make up all you want. Your tuchus is not leaving this planet.</p>", "2252": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Hey, if she's willing to give the milk away for free, who am I to say no?</p>", "2253": "<p><strong><strong>Penny:</strong></strong> What's the gist, physicist?</p>", "2254": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really, Amy?  Tobacco and alcohol? Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?</p>", "2255": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They also took my battle ostrich.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, not Glen.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, the only bird that I ever loved.</p>", "2256": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fine, if Zack's going to be Superman, I want to be Green Lantern.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> But I'm Green Lantern.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You can be Aquaman.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me, I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Hey, babe.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm still mad at you.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Well, you won't be when you hear the great news.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What great news?<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> We're going to a costume party at the comic book store on New Year's Eve, and you get to be Wonder Woman.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible plane sold separately.<br/></p>", "2257": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, why me? Why cant your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> She and her lab team are under quarantine. Seems at the Christmas party they were doing Jell-O shots out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever.<br> </br></br></p>", "2258": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm suddenly feeling flushed. My heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry. In addition, I keep involuntarily saying hoo.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, we know what's causing that, don't we?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> It's no mystery. I obviously have the flu coupled with sudden-onset Tourette's syndrome.</br></br></p>", "2259": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> (Imitating Jar Jar Binks) We-sa going to go into the movie now. Bye bye!</p>", "2260": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Explain to me why Wil Wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don't.<br/><strong>Movie Attendant:</strong> Because I'm the petty functionary with the clipboard, bitch.</p>", "2261": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated.</p>", "2262": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Howard, I found my girdle. It was in the dryer.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> That's great, ma.<br><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> I think it shrunk. I'm spilling out like the Pillsbury Doughboy here.</br></br></p>", "2263": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Now, don't you move. I'll bring over all the food.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I can do it.<br><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Well, isn't that sweet.</br></br></p>", "2264": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have a Masters degree and two Doctorates.  The things I should know, I do know.</p>", "2265": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Can you please just help me?<br><strong>Althea:</strong> All right, all right. Hang on, stay calm. (Over the PA system) I need an orderly with a wheelchair. I got a robot hand grasping a man's penis out here.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You think you could be a little more discreet?<br/><strong>Althea:</strong> I'm sorry. We don't have a code for robot hand grasping a man's penis.</br></p>", "2266": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> That's right, Sheldon. Embrace the dark side.</p>", "2267": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Your check engine light is on.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that. So, you must be devastated about your divorce?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oh, not at all. Though I am a bit distressed to be a in vehicle that's not subjected to regular maintenance.</p>", "2268": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Well, initially I felt something akin to grief and perhaps anger, but that's the natural reaction of the limbic system to being betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch.</p>", "2269": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> (To Bernadette) Come on, I don't wanna eat lamb stew with my mother. (To himself) Damn, was this close to the bra.</p>", "2270": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> (To penny) It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.</p>", "2271": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Yo, Raj, talk to me.  I'm sorry, just screwing with you.</p>", "2272": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Ok, who wants syrup &amp; who wants powdered sugar?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I want oatmeal.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn't a big pain in the ass.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sure that will happen soon enough.</p>", "2273": "<p><strong>Wolowitz</strong>: Yes, she's pushy, and yes, he's whipped, but that's not the expression.</p>", "2274": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.</p>", "2275": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Don't tell me prayer doesn't work.</p>", "2276": "<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Sheldon, you know, I do understand what you're going through.<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in Waitressing stolen from you?</br></p>", "2277": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane. Sheldon voted for train, so we're taking the train.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't say it like that, Leonard. Say it like, \"We're taking the train!\"</p>", "2278": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Tell you what. Forget the SCRFLRRI, let's settle this roboto-a-roboto. There's no guarantee we're going to go against each other in the round robin, so let's throw down. You know, unless you're afraid.</p>", "2279": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you looking at? You've never seen a hypocrite before?</p>", "2280": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't spritz him with that body spray from the commercials where the women undress when they smell it? That doesn't work at all. No matter how much you put on.</p>", "2281": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> There must be another way.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You could try calling AAA. But based on NASA's latest timetable, they wouldn't be out there for another 35 years.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Plus, I understand you need to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.<br/></p>", "2282": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who is going to drive me to work?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're a big boy you'll figure something out.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't talk to me like I'm a child. Now take me to return my Star Wars sheets.</br></br></p>", "2283": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Worst Renaissance Fair ever!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Please let it go, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It was rife with historical inaccuracies, for example, the tavern girl, serving flagons of mead, now her costume was obviously Germanic, but in 1487, the Bavarian purity laws, or Reinheitgebot, severely limited the availability of mead. At best, they would've had some spiced wine.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're nitpicking!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, really? Well, here's another nit for you, the flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.</p>", "2284": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny thinks I'm too smart for her. That's ridiculous!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know! Most of your work is extremely derivative. And don't worry, that's not a secret.</p>", "2285": "<p><strong>Wolowitz</strong>: Leonard, how was your date?\n<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: Bite me!</br></p>", "2286": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Ok, here's the deal. You either help me throw Leonard a birthday party or, so help me God, I will go into your bedroom and I will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. And on one of them, you won't know which, I'll draw a tiny happy face.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You can't do that. If you make a mark on a mint comic book, it's no longer mint.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?</br></br></p>", "2287": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> (Reading Bulletin) We are testing a new medication for social anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Why would they be looking for test subjects here?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know, Raj, maybe the comic store doesn't have a bulletin board.</p>", "2288": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow! So in your world, you're like the cool guys.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Recognize!</p>", "2289": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Seven hundred and sixty degrees Celsius. The approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row.<br/><strong>Gablehauser:</strong> Mr. Wolowitz, this is your second warning.</p>", "2290": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> How about Lasik?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> You want me to get eye surgery?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Well?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm thinking.<br></br></br></br></br></br></p>", "2291": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look at me, look at me, I've got goosebumps.</p>", "2292": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> You know we have an Indian gentleman at the church. Dr. Patel. It's a beautiful story. The Lord spoke to him and moved him to give us all 20% off on Lasek. You know those that needed it.</p>", "2293": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Now let's get crackin'. Shower. Shirt. Shoes. And let's shove off.</p>", "2294": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My mom bought me those pants.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sorry!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're gonna have to call her.</p>", "2295": "<p><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> You said you were going for a walk.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I didn't say outside.</p>", "2296": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can't eat peanuts. When they see me coming they say, \"Ah! No peanut boy!\"</p>", "2297": "<p><strong><strong>Sheldon:</strong></strong> This is to train for a three month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What?!<br/><strong><strong>Sheldon:</strong></strong> I don't know how that sentence could possibly confuse you, but to elaborate, I'm going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali.<br/></p>", "2298": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is there any reason you're keeping\nthis dead goldfish?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.<br></br></br></p>", "2299": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a woman's father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family. In this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard.</p>", "2300": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Who's Siri? Is he dating someone new?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes, his phone.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Is that cute? Or creepy?</p>", "2301": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Please pass the butter!</p>", "2302": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton's party you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I'm characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger's Friendship.\n</p>", "2303": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't understand why you're not enjoying this. Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we're like 'Knight Rider.'<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Except, in Knight Rider, the car isn't a yammering sphincter.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You mock the sphincter, but, the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn't survive. There are over 50 different sphincters in the human body. How many can you name?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I was wrong. This is exactly like Knight Rider.\n</p>", "2304": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I grew up on a farm. From what I heard, they're either having sex or Howard's caught in a milking machine.</p>", "2305": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper</strong>: I tell you, I love that boy to death but he has been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.</p>", "2306": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I can't believe he fired me.<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: Well, you did call him a \"glorified high school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.\"<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: In my defense, I prefaced that with, \"with all due respect.\"</br></br></p>", "2307": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Are there any other honors that I've gotten that I don't know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel Prize is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets.</br></p>", "2308": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> You know something, Jesse. You may have a successful business and the kind of pink complexion that comes with good nutrition, but I have something more important.<br><strong>Jesse:</strong> What's that?<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> Friendship ... which I would trade in a heartbeat for all this.</br></br></p>", "2309": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's my parking spot.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Why do you have a parking spot? You don't have a car. You don't even drive.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I'm not using my nipples either. Maybe they should reassign those.</br></br></br></p>", "2310": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Everyone knows that I'm our group's resident cut-up.</p>", "2311": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hmm, if it's yogurt that helps ladies poop, I think Raj beat you to it.<br/></p>", "2312": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's going to be difficult to find something you are both equally good at. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Is there anything you are both equally bad at?<br/><strong>Sheldon and Kripke</strong>: Sports.<br/></p>", "2313": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> 3000 hours! 3000 hours clicking on that mouse, collecting weapons and gold.

I lost a bet to Wolowitz!</p>", "2323": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears halfway through the second reel, I have returned to save the day. [pause]. Odd, he's usually met by cheers.</p>", "2324": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: I love cheesecake.\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: You're lactose-intolerant.\n<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.\n</br></br></p>", "2325": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What if that burning food attracts animals?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> We have plenty of food for the animals.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We do?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yep. A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's not very nice.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's a bachelor party. Lighten up.</br></p>", "2326": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I am not doing Fun with Flags with you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Because we're broken up!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sonny and Cher made it work. Their variety show kept going long after the divorce, and here we are still talking about them.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No one's talking about Sonny and Cher.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You must be thinking about Donny and Marie, because you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher.</p>", "2327": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me, and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia.</p>", "2328": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie \"Cabin in the Woods?\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fine, we'll go to a hotel.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A hotel? Did you see \"The Shining\"?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did you see \"The Lake House\"?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Nothing bad happens in \"The Lake House\"!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not to them. To me. Time travelling mail box. The only time that travels was the hour and a half of my life down the toilet.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fine, we'll just stay here and do it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, you didn't suggest a beach house.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You would go to a beach house?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, good Lord no. Have you seen \"Jaws\"?</p>", "2329": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Boy, I'm so hungry today. I wonder why.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Because you had sex the other night?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You know what, that might be it. By the way, it isn't like riding a bike. I fell off a few times.</p>", "2330": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So I'm like a bran muffin?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What? No, that's not what I'm saying.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, that's exactly what you're saying. I'm the boring thing you're choosing because I'm good for you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What does it matter? I'm choosing you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It matters a lot. I don't want to be a bran muffin. I want to be a cinnabon, a strawberry pop tart. Something you're excited about, even if it could give you diabetes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want.</p>", "2331": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm prepared to say I love it, as soon as I confirm there are no hobos aboard.</p>", "2332": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I don't think I've ever felt so rejected.

It took two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I didn't defile your sister, we had a relationship.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I heard you called her Brown Sugar. In my book, that's defilement.<br/></p>", "2337": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think you have a real knack for gigolo work, Leonard.</p>", "2338": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He's just so zazzy, don't you think?</p>", "2339": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, there's four of us and one of him.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.</p>", "2340": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, be serious. We're playing a game here. </p>", "2341": "<p><strong>Mary</strong>: I made chicken.

See you Monday.</p>", "2348": "<p><strong>Wolowitz</strong>: Oh, stop it with the fake third world crap. Your father is a gynecologist and you had a house full of servants.<br><strong>Raj</strong>: We only had four servants, and two of them were children.</br></p>", "2349": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How am I gonna get to work.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Take the bus.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I can't take the bus. They don't have seat belts. And they won't let you latch yourself to the seat with bungee chords.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You tried to latch yourself to the seat with bungee chords?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I didn't try, I succeeded. For some reason, it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus.</p>", "2350": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Not only are there children starving in India, there's an Indian starving right here.</p>", "2351": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If there is ever a church of Sheldon, it started here.</p>", "2352": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Yo, P-dawg!</p>", "2353": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am also a son of the Lone Star state. I'm Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me, just ask Mexico.</p>", "2354": "<p><strong>Howard</strong>: Maybe we should have your head notarized.</p>", "2355": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I wish I had a friend like me.</p>", "2356": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong>I think we can make it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Make what?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Make it as friends.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong>Can we be friends that are having sex?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't worry I was just goofin' around.<br/>\n*Leonard and Penny got out of Sheldon's room*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> *dreaming* Not Goofy, no!</p>", "2357": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is the sex starting now?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm having a panic attack.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, okay. Well then, calm down!</p>", "2358": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active Volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii.</p>", "2359": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe that's what this whole thing's about. You're not mad at me, you're mad at yourself.\n<br><strong>Raj:</strong> No, I'm mad at you. I hate myself, but I'm mad at you.\n</br></p>", "2360": "<p><strong>Penny</strong>: You know, I believe in ghosts, too.<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: Great.<br><strong>Penny</strong>: And astrology.<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: I know, and pyramid power and healing crystals.<br><strong>Penny</strong>: Oh, no, no, no, crystals don\u2019t work.<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: Really, that\u2019s the line? Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?<br><strong>Penny</strong>: Oh, Voodoo is real. You don't want to mess with Voodoo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>", "2361": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why can't there just be one week each month for famous people to die?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, they've already arranged to die in threes. What more do you want from them?</br></p>", "2362": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, this is not a big deal. It's a little white lie, everyone does it.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Not me, I'm a 100% honest in all of my relationships.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> And how single are you right now?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Eating-cake-on-the-toilet single.</br></br></p>", "2363": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Being with Amy has awoken the sexual creature within. When I see a pretty gal walking down the street, I think, \"hubba hubba\" like any other guy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You kiss your mother with that mouth? 'Cause it's fine.</p>", "2364": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, when Leonard's feeling anxious, I make him take a long walk.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Does that help?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> For a while, then he comes back.</p>", "2365": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Really? You're ahead of Bale? The man who personified the words, \"I'm Batman.\"<br/><strong>Adam West:</strong> I never had to say I'm Batman. I showed up. People knew I was Batman.<br/>\nEverywhere I went. On the TV show, mall openings, Julie Newmar's bungalow.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sold- you're ahead of Bale.<br/><strong>Adam West:</strong> There's another reason I should be higher on the list. All those other guys had muscles built into their costumes. All I had in my Batsuit was 100%, grade-A West.</p>", "2366": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You guys can go in if you want.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, we're a team. If you can't go in, we're not going in.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Then why are we drinking?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, it's not like she's got the Christ child in there, all right?</p>", "2367": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're kidding! What kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else's bedroom?!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thank you, Pasadena! Good night!</p>", "2368": "<p><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Moonpie!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Meemaw! I'm so happy to see you!<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> I'm happy to see you, too!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, you got even smaller. I love it!</p>", "2369": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, this is so nice. He's so excited to have you here and-<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Okay, now let's you and me get something straight. He may think that I came to bake him cookies, but the real reason is to size you up.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> S-S-si-Size me up?<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Sheldon's mother may be okay with you, but I'm not so easy.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I-I'm I'm sure you'll like me once you get to know me.<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Oh, you better hope so.</p>", "2370": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, uh, we're meeting for coffee like two adults. Everybody's happy. Easy peasy.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Are you gonna tell Emily?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, of course. We have no secrets.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> When are you gonna tell Emily?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> He lied about the cream cheese! He ate the whole thing! I saw him!</br></p>", "2371": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, making sure the telescope's camera is white-field balanced.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm. What are you doing now?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Still making sure the telescope's camera is white-field balanced.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I see. How about now?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Now I'm making sure the telescope's camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a coloring book.</p>", "2372": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay. Now, what I'm hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish I'd be more succinct.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.</p>", "2373": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So, what do you think we should do with this room?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, I was thinking a home theater or a gaming room - you know, like a man cave.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why can't it be a woman cave?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> As long as it has a home theater, a video game system and you're not allowed in it, you can call it whatever you want.</p>", "2374": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is my ticket to Star Wars. I don't need to tell you that it is worth far more than its face value of $15.50. I trust you'll give it to someone worthy.<br/>\n(Sheldon hands the ticket to Leonard)<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You got it. Penny might want to join us-<br/>\n(Sheldon yanks the ticket out of Leonard's hand and goes to Raj)<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is my ticket to Star Wars...</p>", "2375": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Since when do you hum songs?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What are you talking about?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You were just humming.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you sure? Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let's see. (starts humming) Hey! I was humming. One point for Hufflepuff.</p>", "2376": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now this is your spot. You're very protective of it. When anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. It sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable.</p>", "2377": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Face it, you can't stump me. I am the king of husbands.<br/>\nI know that you don't like the lingerie that I got you on Valentine's Day.<br/>\nI know you hate the word \"moist.\"<br/>\nI know-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hang on. Wait, wait. Why don't I like the lingerie you got me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because it's orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Interesting. I never told you that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure you did.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No. I never told anyone that. But I did write it in my journal.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (In a high-pitched voice) What? I didn't know you had a journal.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I also know your voice gets higher when you're lying.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (In a deep voice) No, it doesn't.</p>", "2378": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sure. What is it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's called Food, Friend, Fight. One of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So it's like Kiss, Marry, Kill.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What is that?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's a game where you're given three people and you choose which one you'd kiss, marry, or kill.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, my game is better, 'cause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them.</p>", "2379": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I miss this.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How can you miss a game you've never played before, silly?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I guess sometimes I'm silly.</p>", "2380": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You sure you're up for that? She did hurt you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no, it's all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum: sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavorless lump of sadness.</p>", "2381": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, you want to swing by that place tonight and get a look at this guy?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We don't even know what time they're gonna be there.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'll just call the restaurant, pretend I'm Amy and check the reservation.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Damn, you're sneaky.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, but I'm little, so it's adorable.</p>", "2382": "<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> And I don't need to tell you, there aren't a lot of men who love physics, archaic languages and flags of the world.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am a bit of a unicorn.</p>", "2383": "<p><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> You gonna be okay down here?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, I feel like an archaeologist. Indiana Jones and the Single-Family Dwelling.</p>", "2384": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> According to a recent study, simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still, can have physical benefits. For all you know, I could be exercising right now.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Are you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Na, I'll do it tomorrow.</p>", "2385": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's ridiculous.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why? You never thought you'd end up in a relationship, and then you met Amy. Maybe there's someone else out there for you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> True, but Penny's married, and so is Bernadette. And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia.</br></p>", "2386": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Barry Kripke was there. I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, actually, he already did.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. But don't get too attached to him. In two years, 364 days, he's a dead man.</p>", "2387": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Do you guys know any musicians?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I was thinking it might be cool to have live music here a few nights a week. You know, give this place more of a \"staying in business\" vibe.</p>", "2388": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> No, I want to. Look, we've put this off long enough. Let's do it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, that's exactly what you said the first time we slept together.</p>", "2389": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm going to guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no, not just a season. If I'm in, I'm in for the whole run, even if the quality declines. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.</p>", "2390": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Ready to call tech support? <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Give me the number. Probably wind up talking to some foreign guy who's reading from the same manual I have. <br/>\n*Raj's phone rings. Sheldon, Howard, and Bernadette stare at him in shock*<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's my father, you jerks.</p>", "2391": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, I grew up in this house, okay? No one's knocking anything down. <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay, okay. *to Raj* When he's at Comic-Con, I'm bringing in a wrecking ball.</p>", "2392": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I think I started to suspect it was a bad movie when I looked at the sc<x>ript and saw the title, \"Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill\". <br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Uh, spoiler alert. After the monkey sees, it kills.</x></p>", "2393": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution, but I've since evolved, and now I think it's dumb.</p>", "2394": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, I just felt this wave of emotion for you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You sure it's not too much bible juice?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And the wave is gone.</p>", "2395": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What's up?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm mad at Amy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Did you she leave pit stains in your favorite crop top, too?</p>", "2396": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Penny, I really want to eat this banana, but it's stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box.</p>", "2397": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know why he's grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once, I'm still floating.</p>", "2398": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm sick of people being mean on the Internet.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things they'd never say to your face.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Interesting. I can't think of a single thing I wouldn't say to someone's face.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Never noticed that about you.</p>", "2399": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> All canines instinctively know how to swim. Why wouldn't a werewolf have the same abilities?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, they're not a hundred percent wolf. They're a werewolf, that's only a part wolf. That's like comparing apples to oranges.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you! Although technically it's apples that turn into were-oranges when the moon is full.<br/><br/>\nOh, this is fun. We should do it sometime when you aren't all PMSing.</p>", "2400": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I knew you'd understand, armadillo Isaac Newton.</p>", "2401": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I did not force you to go to that.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> You left the house in a fez and a bow tie. I went so you wouldn't get beat up.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I wasn't going to get beat up.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You were but somehow I held myself back.</br></p>", "2402": "<p><strong>Professor Sharp:</strong> To be honest, his research never amounted to anything.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You were his colleague. How did your research turn out?<br/><strong>Professor Sharp:</strong> Great! This is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You could be very frugal. I'm getting a little tired of everybody's sarcasm.</p>", "2403": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I love that I'm a slob around here and you're kinda okay with that.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Uh-huh. And I love that I work and do all the cleaning and you're okay with that.</p>", "2404": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> How does it feel to know your fiance's job is to go out and flirt with doctors looking like that, while you sit here, you know, looking like this?</p>", "2405": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It's true. You're both gorgeous. Kinda says something about the man who could bed you both. *Laughs* (To Emily) You get why I've been alone most of my adult life?</p>", "2406": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You reported me to human resources?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You violated the sanctity of my mouth.</p>", "2407": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> We're in a moving car! What do you expect me to do, stick my fingers in my ears?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog, but that'll work.</p>", "2408": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, I'm going to miss you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course you are.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You just made that easier.</p>", "2409": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, it's too late. I'm your bran muffin. Probably fat free and good for your colon.</p>", "2410": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No. He blew up the death star. ... Why do I know this?</p>", "2411": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Anyway, it'll be a nice surprise for the boys. And Howie doesn't think I take his interests seriously, so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while.</p>", "2412": "<p><strong>Arthur:</strong> This is weird. Most of my robes open in the back.</p>", "2413": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Did you watch Professor Proton when you were a kid?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No. My dad controlled the TV, so unless someone was a Texas Ranger, Jake or the Fat Man, we didn't see it.</p>", "2414": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're back.<br/><strong>Arthur:</strong> Yeah, apparently I'm here whenever you need me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's nice.<br/><strong>Arthur:</strong> Maybe for you.</p>", "2415": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I hope I can meet her as soon as possible.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Why the rush? She isn't going anywhere.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, she is. But I like that attitude!</br></p>", "2416": "<p><strong>Emily:</strong> Oh my God I remember.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Can I finish my astronaut story?<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> It was four years ago<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Please don't say it.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> We were set up on a blind date.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Please don't say it.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> You came to my apartment.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're saying it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What happened?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, I'll say it. I was on the way to pick her up and my stomach felt a little funny. When I got there I asked if I could use her bathroom.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Please don't say it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> One roll of toilet paper and twenty minutes later, I was so humiliated I snook out the window and never saw her again.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> You know what else I never saw again? My security deposit.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm so sorry. I tried to unclog it but you didn't have a plunger and water was spilling out everywhere.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Right, just water. </p>", "2417": "<p>Emily: If it makes you feel better, you're not the wierdest guy I've met off the Internet.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, give me a chance. You don't even know me.</p>", "2418": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And now that I think about it. I stood in front of a case of iPods and I bought a Zune.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What's a Zune?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Exactly! It's an MP3 people brought to us by the makers of Xbox.</p>", "2419": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, she's my wife. If anyone's gonna make her feel gross about sex, it's me.</p>", "2420": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on, let's just get this over with.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> \"Let's just get this over with?\" Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory or are we having sex?</p>", "2421": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Look, I admit that it's odd that Raj didn't write to you himself. But if you get to know him, you'll see he's just a sweet, regular guy. As a counterpoint, here he is uninvited and visibly sweaty.</p>", "2422": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> First off, know that we love you and cherish you.<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> Well, I wouldn't go -<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Daddy.<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> You're great.</p>", "2423": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It just seems silly for us to sit in two groups.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big, evil baby.</p>", "2424": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny and I are going to go shop for a dining room table. Do you want to come with us?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'd love to, but I'm too busy falling back in love with Windows 98.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Seriously? You haven't used this desk in years. The second I want to get rid of it you're up here working.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't talk right now. I have several thousand updates to install.</p>", "2425": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, this one looks nice.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, Sheldon doesn't like reclaimed wood.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He's afraid the original owners will come back.</p>", "2426": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You were really going to stand by me against the dining room table?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Of course I was.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, how do I know you're not manipulating me right now?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I think if I were manipulating you, you'd be smart enough to see it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How do I know you're not saying that as part of the manipulation?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You'd be smart enough to see that too.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. Sorry I gave you such a hard time. I just had to be sure.</p>", "2427": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, Los Angeles. I'm on a ferris wheel with Darth Vader and he's nicer than you think.<br/><strong>James Earl Jones:</strong> I am!</p>", "2428": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm going to go inside, put on my cosiest pajamas, curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over.</p>", "2429": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies that they can draw water in through their genitals.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, well I don't think we're gonna get to do that today.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milkshake without getting brain freeze.</p>", "2430": "<p><strong>Bill Nye:</strong> Wow, Arthur Jeffries. It's an honor to meet you. My show would never have happened without yours.<br><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  That's what I told my lawyers.</br></p>", "2431": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Besides, can you even name one romantic thing you've done for me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I can name tons.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And sex doesn't count.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh.</p>", "2432": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is the magic marker I was using when I made the discovery.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't think the Smithsonian is gonna want your marker.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And that's why you're not on my list for the tree fort.</p>", "2433": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Not even the one on the breast feeding crisis?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It was not a crisis. Apparently I favored the left one, she got a little lopsided.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh my God, you still go left!<br/></p>", "2434": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom's make-up and wears balloon boobies.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> They weren't boobies, they were muscles. And the make-up was green, I was pretending to be The Hulk.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You were wearing her bra.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?!</p>", "2435": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter Egg Hunt with no eggs to see how long I'd keep looking? The answer, by the way, June.</p>", "2436": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> More like Little House of the Prepostorous.</p>", "2437": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> My carpal tunnel is acting up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Play through the pain.</p>", "2438": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Once again, unbelievable.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, once again, I know.</p>", "2439": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, the transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. You know, like, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or someone in a romantic relationship might feel differently than they appear to.</p>", "2440": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know what the anthropic principle is.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course. I just explained it to you. Now, where do you stand on it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where do you stand on it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Strongly pro.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Then I believe that God created the world in six days and on the seventh he made you to annoy me.</p>", "2441": "<p><strong>Spock Doll:</strong> What is the purpose of a toy?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> To be played with.<br/><strong>Spock Doll:</strong> Therefore to not play with it would be...?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Illogical. Damn it, Spock, you're right.\n</p>", "2442": "<p><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> (To Leonard) Did I just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Because if you did, you get your picture up there, on the Wall of Heroes.\n</p>", "2443": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I always tell people, if you have only one day in Los Angeles, make it a train day.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> \"Train Day?\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The fun starts with brunch at Carney's in Studio City, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop, Travel Town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars, and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Then finally, we're off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, for dinner at, that's right, the Hollywood Carney's, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't think we're gonna do that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, then apparently, you hate fun.</p>", "2444": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, damn, they canceled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new MasterCard.</p>", "2445": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, here's a fun fact. Ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean, and grape.</p>", "2446": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Ok, ok, how about this. We tell him somebody broke in?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just to shoot the couch with the paint ball gun?\n<br><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm sorry, I'll buy it. All those people are on drugs.\n<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We can tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.</br></p>", "2447": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage, his father and I only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.<br><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Yes, we think so. We've both done papers on it. Mine from the neuroscientific point of view and his from an anthropological. Mine, of course, was the only one worth reading.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Well, it's all online, or you can order it from the Princeton University Press.</br></br></p>", "2448": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Well, Leonard's younger brother, Michael, is a tenured law professor at Harvard, and his sister just successfully grew a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So, she's close to curing diabetes?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wow, you must be very proud.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Why? They're not my accomplishments. I have to urinate.</p>", "2449": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Your scan data will be very helpful to my research. You have a remarkable brain.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know. Although, I've always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Common complaint among men. Nothing's ever big enough. Except when they get a tumor, Then you never hear the end of it.</p>", "2450": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> It's out of order.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Yes, I can read the sign. I was just pondering the implications.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I think it implies that the elevator doesn't work.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Again, I can read the sign. But the sign and the tape are covered with a layer of dust which indicates the elevator has been non-functional for a significant period of time, which suggests either a remarkable passivity among the - I assume - 24-36 residents of this building - based on the number of mail boxes and typical urban densities - or a shared delusion of functionality.</p>", "2451": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's where I sit.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Ooh, you have a special spot. What kind of wacko are you?</p>", "2452": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, jerk face, you forgot your iPod.</p>", "2453": "<p><strong>Sheldon: </strong> Oh, and one more thing, it's on bitch.</p>", "2454": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn't conceive.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Can you imagine Spock's dad in a room with a copy of \"Pointy Ears and Shapely Rears\"?</p>", "2455": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What kind of sick?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, the flu, I guess.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't need you to guess, I need you to know. Now, when did the symptoms first appear?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Maybe Friday!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Friday! Was that morning or afternoon?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't--<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Think, woman! Who blew their nose and when?</p>", "2456": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP racing down fiber optic cable at the of light to San Francisco bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the external receiver attached to this...lamp.</p>", "2457": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> That was absolutely humiliating.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah party.</p>", "2458": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a Summer's Eve.\n<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah and the bag it came in.</br></p>", "2459": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not only that Sheldon saved my life, but that he didn't report me to the landlord, or the police, or homeland security.</p>", "2460": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fiber content. <br> <strong>Sheldon</strong>: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.</br></p>", "2461": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: What happened to him? <br/> <strong>Howard</strong>: He wouldn't sleep so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mother's Valium in it. Tag you're it!</p>", "2462": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You mean like a beta test?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, technically, this would be an alpha test. A beta test requires people that weren't involved in the development of the appli-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, absolutely you should.\n</p>", "2463": "<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Oh man, did the KISS Army repeal \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\"?</p>", "2464": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's this?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Tea. it's costumary to serve hot beverages when one is in emotional distress. [pats Leonard's head] There there. You want to talk about it?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank godness. 'There there' was really all I had.</br></br></br></p>", "2465": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm leading a study to see if deficiency of the monoamine oxidase enzyme leads to paralysing fear in monkies.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> If they're anything like humans, the answer is yes.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You've done this experiment on humans?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You mean like death row inmates with nothing to lose? No, that would be unethical.</p>", "2466": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I've got a sexy new tube top that says come hither and a bottle of pepper spray that says close enough, Jack!</p>", "2467": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you're interested I can send you a link to a YouTube video that would show you how to perform your own rectal exam. Helpful hint: trim your nails first.</p>", "2468": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college, okay?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Forget? You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven't forgotten a thing since the day my mother stopped breast-feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.</p>", "2469": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Drop dead, you stupid, self-centered bastard.</p>", "2470": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I love where you skip over the part where no one asks.</p>", "2471": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don't have to do it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> In fact, it's better if you don't. Otherwise, it makes the rest of us look bad.</p>", "2472": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So it's based on your life?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, I'm from <em>Omaha</em>!</p>", "2473": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Eugh, English pudding. You get yourself all excited for pudding and here comes a cake with raisins in it.</p>", "2474": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh my gosh, that's the girl that broke Rajesh's heart.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's Lucy?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't know why but I always pictured her as Indian.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I think that reason's called racism.</br></br></br></p>", "2475": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What kind of comics do the guys like?\n<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> Um, a little bit of everything. Mostly superhero stuff.\n<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> All right, well, who's the best superhero?\n<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Shh! You can't ask a question like that in here. Are you trying to start a rumble?\n</br></p>", "2476": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The need to find another human being to share one's life with has always puzzled me. Maybe because I'm so interesting all by myself. With that being said, may you find as much happiness with each other as I find on my own.</p>", "2477": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> That would be my boyfriend. Happier playing his dopey Star Trek game with his friends than hanging out with me<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wars.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Star Wars.

If we pick a place <br/>\neast of here, we might find the balloon.</p>", "2495": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm really nervous.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I know.

We're no strangers to the fragrant arm pit. Next.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's also a live mine, so there'll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have a lactose-intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream.

Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> You clearly haven't been with me at Mardi Gras.</br></p>", "2521": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> She should quiet down soon. I gave her enough pain meds to choke a ... well, her.</p>", "2522": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'll show you what's in the box if you promise not to flip out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why would I flip out? Is it a spider? Oh, oh, it's a spider?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, if it were a spider, Lenny would have flipped out.</p>", "2523": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> This is fun. I'm gonna feel like a vixen wearing jewellery that doesn't have a list of medications I'm allergic to.</p>", "2524": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Penny, if you truly want to be romantic it has to come from you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I get that, but why is this so hard?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You've probably never had to do this before because you're young and beautiful, and men have always thrown themselves at you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I'm trying to be sad about that. I can't.<br/><br/></p>", "2525": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What started as a pap smear turned into a date, which turned into her working there, which turned into marriage, which then turned into hatred which continues to this day. </p>", "2526": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I appreciate your concern but I won't be seeing any more of Amy than I already do. I assume we'll deduct any extra time I see her at work from our weekly quota.'<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Please let me be there when you tell her that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why? So you can see the look on her face when she hears my top notch idea?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Please, oh please, just le me be there.</p>", "2527": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What did you put as the one word description of yourself?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I put unobjectionable. But now I hear it out loud, it just seems like I'm being cocky.</p>", "2528": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> That's right, ladies. For all you know, I'm confident and fun to be around.</p>", "2529": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Leonard: I didn't make it back. The ship sank. I'm in Hell.</p>", "2530": "<p><strong><strong>Amy:</strong></strong> Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we could score us some free omelettes.</p>", "2531": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> We could just let Sheldon see it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Have you seen that apartment? Labels on everything. Even the label maker has a label on it that says 'label maker.' And if you look really closely on that label, there will be a really small label that says 'label.'            </p>", "2532": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey! Shouldn't you be out with your gang spray painting equations on the sides of buildings?  </p>", "2533": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm glad men are wearing hats again. They are so distinguished.</p>", "2534": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'd like for you to call me sexy.<br/><strong>Siri:</strong> [chimes] From now on, I'll call you sexy. Okay?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay!<br/></p>", "2535": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All these years I've been so wrong. The tinier the trains, the more concentrated the fun.</p>", "2536": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm no stanger to mimetic epidemiology. At Johnson Elementary school, the phrase Shelly Cooper's a smelly pooper spread like wildfire.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> I should think so, that's gold.</br></p>", "2537": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sadly Penny, this evening I am the dark knight roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape and a stern expression for my cowl.</p>", "2538": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I agreed to speak to you this evening because I was told that you're the best and the brightest of this university's doctoral candidates. Hmm. Of course, that's like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. 'Cause you see, there's only one electron in a hydrogen atom. Best and brightest my sweet patootee. All right, let's begin. Show of hands, who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? Don't kid yourselves.</p>", "2539": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> This is the worst cobbler I've ever eaten. It tastes like it's made of actual ground-up shoemaker.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amusing. A play on the two meanings of cobbler.</p>", "2540": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> When I made that agreement, I didn't think I'd ever have a hot girlfriend, and I was positive you never would.</p>", "2541": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated.</p>", "2542": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You see. People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Not true. People have been pointing and laughing at you your whole life.</p>", "2543": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You know the old saying: pasty and frail never fail.</p>", "2544": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> \"Gerry the Gerbil and the bully boys on the bus.\" Read it, not helpful.</p>", "2545": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard might be home, can we talk in my apartment?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We're not done?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Eh, why not? We're already through the looking glass anyway.</p>", "2546": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look, you may have democracy in your beloved Russia, but on this physics bowl team, I rule with an iron fist. (Raising his fist) Ow!</p>", "2547": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> We'll just have to face Sheldon mano y mano y mano a mano.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Wait, you're going up against Sheldon Cooper?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes!<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> That arrogant, misogynistic, East Texas doorknob that told me I should abandon my work with high-energy particles for laundry and child bearing?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She's in!</p>", "2548": "<p><strong>Penny</strong>: I need some guinea pigs.<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you can try. But if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest white mice? Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.<br><strong>Penny</strong>: I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of talking to you.<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: His mom's been saying that for years.</br></br></br></p>", "2549": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Put it on the back burner.</p>", "2550": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> He sounds like a wise man.<br><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh, not that wise. He once tried to fight a bobcat for some licorice.</br></p>", "2551": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Now, after a moment of silent meditation, I'm going to end with \"In Jesus name\". Now you two, don't feel under any obligation to join in. Unless, of course, the Holy Spirit moves you.</p>", "2552": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Ah beer, the magic elixir that can turn this poor shy Indian boy in the life of the party ... Oh yeah!</p>", "2553": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst! Who needs Halo when we can be regaled delightfully with the folksy tale of the \"whore of Omaha\"?</p>", "2554": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I love astro-physics. It's like looking at the universe naked.</p>", "2555": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's hard to say no to Yoo-hoo. The name literally beckons.</p>", "2556": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Unlikely, but make your case. Keeping in mind your critical attitude is ruining our Saturday night together, and I'm not above minimizing your window.</p>", "2557": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You'll never guess what just happened.\n<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I give up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't guess. As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on observations and experimentation. Although it occurs to me, you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.</p>", "2558": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My hands are magic.</p>", "2559": "<p><strong>Raj</strong>: Is this just so we won't touch your stuff while you're away?<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I'll admit that was a concern, but the fact is I'll need a support team, and the three of you are my first choice.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Well, there are others who might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache.</br></p>", "2560": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Tell Mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds and that I'm having regular bowel movements.</p>", "2561": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Don't be so hard on yourself. Do you know the story of Catherine The Great?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> She ruled Russia in the late 1700s and one night when she was feeling particularly randy she used an intricate system of pullies to have intimate relations with a horse.</p>", "2562": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, you need a four-person team. We're four people<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a huppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition.</br></p>", "2563": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big Boy.<br><strong>Penny</strong>: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would I settle for something that's <em>like</em> a Big Boy?</br></p>", "2564": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm so sorry. I really thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.\n<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: No, it was a valid hypothesis.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: \"Was a valid hypo-\" . What is happening to you?\n</p>", "2565": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She's still not answering.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> My father's not texting me back.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> 'cause they both turned their phones off.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't like this at all.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't like it either.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? 'cause I love it.</br></p>", "2566": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, can I come in?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How do you know I'm not using the facilities?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though I've clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times.</p>", "2567": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Found one.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, you didn't. There are millions of data points there.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But, look, an optical transient.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, maybe that is something. How did you find that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It wasn't difficult. You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when they're twin primes, they're pink and smell like gasoline?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. I guess I'm a special boy. You know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a Fudgsicle. Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light.</p>", "2568": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Maybe intimate is what I need.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You sure? You've never really been with a man. Do you really want to start with one that's 6ft 7\"?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> 'Cause it's like taking your driver's test in a bus.</p>", "2569": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I can't believe Sheldon asked you to be his roommate.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I can't believe he ran my credit.</p>", "2570": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Unhand me! This is ridiculous.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I told you to put tape on his mouth.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And I told you he bit me!</p>", "2571": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But enough about the Czech Republic. Let's talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake, and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn't, and yet Romania got dumped. I'll pause here while you mull that one over. I know, right?</p>", "2572": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> All the other comments said really nice things. Focus on those.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah. Dr. Dimitri Plankovic of Moscow University said \"This paper great. I love it more than vodka.\"<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> See, better with the accent.</p>", "2573": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> \"'Time travel? I don't understand', said Amelia. Cooper stared at her, 'Which word don't you understand? Time or travel.\"<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Wow. Even in your fantasy, Sheldon's kind of exhausting.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> He's like that in the beginning so she can change him. It's called good writing. And wishful thinking.</p>", "2574": "<p><strong>LeVar Burton:</strong> Wil Wheaton said get a gate. I don't know why I didn't get a gate.</p>", "2575": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> After a lively debate, that motion passed by a 2-0 margin.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.</p>", "2576": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> There's no way this is sixty feet.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm looking at it!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You realize this isn't one of those times I want you to exaggerate how long something is.</p>", "2577": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Give me a minute. I'm stimulating the pleasure center of this starfish. I just need to turn it off.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What happens if you don't?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Then I have to sit through lunch knowing this starfish is having a better day than I am.</p>", "2578": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm proud of you, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm proud of me, too. I've done all my research, I conducted an informal poll, and I've arrived at the rock solid certainly I've made the right choice.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, that's got to be a good feeling.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, it is. Although ...<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh crap!</p>", "2579": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Emily, your face is like a precious Dew-kissed flower.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Wow.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I know. Powerful stuff, huh?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No. You're supposed to be yourself. Not all desperate and creepy.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, I'm getting some mixed messages here.</p>", "2580": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I mean really, what's so great about being grown up?<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well for starters, we'd be splitting this check three ways.</br></p>", "2581": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> (To Raj) Should somebody as lonely as you really be making fun of me?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, grow up, Howard! God.</p>", "2582": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So what am I supposed to do now?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?</p>", "2583": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Aww, that's great. You're going to be an uncle. Uncle Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper.</p>", "2584": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, you guys ready to order  or do you need a few minutes?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> *mumbles*<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Few minutes it is.</p>", "2585": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh stop it. I don't need to take this admiration from the likes of you people.</p>", "2586": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I was just thinking about my mom and how sad my childhood was.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, I bet it sucked. I'm gonna take a bath and you do the dishes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> How about I take a bath with you? See what happens?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Here's what's going to happen: I'm going to take a bath, you're gonna do the dishes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's it? No compassion?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> \"Aww, poor Howie\". We good? I'm going to take a bath.</p>", "2587": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well now I know how it must have felt being mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.</p>", "2588": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You don't know what it's like to feel completely frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yeah, sounds like a drag.</p>", "2589": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> A micro-valentine for a microbiologist.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> From her micro-husband.</p>", "2590": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, here's how love works. You're gonna return the machine or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> [pondering]<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, my God! Are you actually thinking about it?</p>", "2591": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: What are you doing?<br/><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Well, he wasn't using it, and I needed some cool leather to wiggle my naked ass on.</p>", "2592": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, you've never worked in a lab like this before. You have no experience in the field of biology.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have plenty of experience in biology. I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998. And it's still alive. Let's do this.</p>", "2593": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You should've seen the look on your face!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, yes. The slightly widened eyes of mildly startled.</p>", "2594": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong>You called the police because someone hacked your \"World of Warcraft\" account?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong>What choice did I have? The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf, hero of the Eastern Kingdoms, has been picked clean like a carcass is the desert sun. Plus the FBI hung up on me.</p>", "2595": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Why did you bring that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No weapon strikes more fear into a man's heart than a Klingon bat'leth.</p>", "2596": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> So are you guys coming to my New Year's Eve costume party?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course. We're coming as the Justice League of America.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Switching it up from last year when we came as the Justice League of America.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> To that point, it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak li<x>nk, which is clearly Leonard as Superman.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's sad. Let's ask ourselves, is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Than than Leonard in high-heeled boots? Howard's mother in high-heeled boots?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Zack?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> He is the only person we know with actual muscles.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You can't replace me with Zack.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why not? Penny did it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, she seems happier. Why wouldn't we be?<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Score. I got an Archie, Betty and Veronica, and a Jughead. All set for my weekend number twos.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Congratulations. Zack, how would you like to be Superman?<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> I don't know, sounds like a lot of responsibility.<br/></x></p>", "2597": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> (To Raj) Really? That's your question? When did he put a ramp in?</p>", "2598": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Howard, what are you doing in there?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm taking a bath.<br><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> I hope that's all you're doing. We share that tub!</br></br></p>", "2599": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'll tell you what happened. (sigh) We were young. We were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-travelling mailbox at my lake house.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?</p>", "2600": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I got the Mars-rover stuck in the ditch.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Where?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield. Where do you think?! On Mars!</p>", "2601": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock.<br/><strong>Missy:</strong> And what do you mean \"mediocre stock\"?!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That would be you.</p>", "2602": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Did the listing actually saying \"Miniature\"?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (Looking at time machine) I just assumed.</p>", "2603": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong>  I will form my own team and will destroy the molecular bonds that hold your matter together, and reduce the resulting particular chaos to tears. <br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thanks for the heads up.<br> </br></br></p>", "2604": "<p><strong>Mrs. Koothrappali:</strong> What are we suppose to tell Lalita's parents?<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at him.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why don't you keep your eye on the ball, Papa?</p>", "2605": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I'm just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale.</p>", "2606": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You didn't know? You have three strikes. Strike 1: You came in. Strike 2: You sat down. Strike 3: I don't like your attitude.</p>", "2607": "<p><strong>Howard</strong>: Behold the Mobile Omni-Directional Neutralization and Termination Eradicator! Or... <br> <strong>Leonard, Sheldon, Howard, Raj</strong>: Monte.</br></p>", "2608": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> If you want help, just hire a grad student.\n<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Maybe I could do it.\n<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You, really? You can assess the quality of my work? Okay, um, here. I wrote this when I was five years old.\n<br><strong>Penny:</strong> A proof that algebraic topology can never have a non self-contradictory set of abelion groups. Im just a blond monkey to you, aren't I?\n<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You said it, not me.\n</br></br></br></br></p>", "2609": "<p>(Leonard is pointing out the monotonous movie habits of their former relationship.)<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. You always picked, and it was always the same. An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> But, come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes.<br/></p>", "2610": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you want to blend in with Penny's friends, I'd think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage.</p>", "2611": "<p><strong>Christy:</strong> Mmm! There's my little engine that could.<br/>\n*Howard makes train noise*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.</p>", "2612": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Does your family have a history of heart disease?<br/><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> My family is the history of heart disease. There's a cave painting in France of one of my ancestors doing this. *Mimics heart attack*\n</p>", "2613": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> All I'm saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie, they could probably make an actual Hulk.</p>", "2614": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: How long is he going to stay here?<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard. Where's he going to go? Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.</br></p>", "2615": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Speaking of Sheldon, how's single life treating you?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Fine, I guess. I've been focusing on me. I was thinking about changing my wardrobe.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes!<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Good for you!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> But then I decided I don't want to go changing who I am just because of some man.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Good for you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, it is normal to want to change your look after a breakup.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Actually, I was thinking of making one small change.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Your sweater?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Your glasses?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Your hair?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Your shoes.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Piercing my ears.</br></br></br></p>", "2616": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Piercing my ears.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, you really never had that done?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> My mom said pierced ears were for whores, pirates and genies.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, well, you're a grown woman now.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I know, but Sheldon had this clause in the Relationship Agreement forbidding cosmetic surgery unless it's to look like a Klingon.</p>", "2617": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wow, wow, wow, wow. Just because I love you, doesn't mean girls are allowed in my room.</p>", "2618": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Were you seeing other men?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aren't you going to ask me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on, really?</p>", "2619": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh sure. I sit on the floor for years and no one cares. The pretty white girl's there ten seconds and suddenly we're all running to IKEA.</p>", "2620": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> That's very nice, but I have a boyfriend.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> That's what they all say. You just don't want to go out with me because I have an off-putting personality.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, that's not true. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like way worse than you.</p>", "2621": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Why would you push a cow over? They're sacred.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, stop it. I've seen you eat like a million hamburgers.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious.</p>", "2622": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I can't believe Penny's married to Zack.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I wonder what she saw in that guy.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't know. He's sweet. He's tall. Handsome.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Broad shoulders. Good hair.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hmm, I wonder what she sees in Leonard.</p>", "2623": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So what tools did you bring?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Everything we need to make jewellery moulds. Here's some silver, a crucible, and an acetylene torch to melt it down.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, that looks fun.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Maybe you should master glue before you move onto fire.</p>", "2624": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Aww, what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Just putting something in the bank for what horrible thing I do next.</p>", "2625": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> When you told me I was going to be \"losing my virginity\", I didn't think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My apologies. I chose my words poorly. I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch.</br></p>", "2626": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Please don't take my looking forward to Leonard coming home as criticism of you in his absence. That criticism will come later in your report card.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I didn't stay for the detention. I'm not going to read the report card.</p>", "2627": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's curious. If there's no one here, why are there two glasses of wine on the table?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, well you know. I've got two hands and a bit of a drinking prolbem.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course. Ask a silly question.</p>", "2628": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you implying my girlfriend doesn't have any sexuality to exploit?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, because that was not clear.</p>", "2629": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> (Mimicking Bernadette in a high voice) Oh Howie, stop talking about space so much. Nobody likes it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (In a low voice) I don't sound like that.</p>", "2630": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> (To Bernadette) A Catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm I've been hoping for.</p>", "2631": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't wanna go back to India, it's hot and loud, and there are so many people! You have no idea, they're everywhere.</p>", "2632": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I think we'll pass.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, is the Mrs speaking for the couple now?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> In this case, you bet she is.</p>", "2633": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh look, Saturn 3 is on.\n<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't want to watch Saturn 3. Deep Space Nine is better.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3?\n<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Simple subtraction will tell you its six better.\n</p>", "2634": "<p><b>Raj</b>: Hold on a second. Kreplach??\n<br/><b>Howard</b>: Yeah.\n<br/><b>Raj</b>: That isn't Klingon.

Define it.\n<br/><b>Howard</b>: Kreplach a hearty Klingon.....dumpling.</p>", "2635": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Please don't let this be Sheldon playing bongos.</p>", "2636": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (knocking) All my friends. (knocking) All my friends. (knocking) All my friends.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wow, I think it's like Beetlejuice. We must've said his name too many times.</p>", "2637": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Now, I downloaded an app that might be helpful in this situation. <br/>\n[whip cracks]<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're right. I'm smart as a whip. I should be able to figure this out.</p>", "2638": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> If I roll down the windows, everything is peachy. If you roll down the windows, you're still not a doctor.</p>", "2639": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, I once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And that didn't bother you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Au contraire. It meant that she was gullible and open to a little probing.</p>", "2640": "<p><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> I am the sword master!</p>", "2641": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other, and just be together?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> That sounds nice.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Good. I've loved you from the moment we met and I will keep loving you until the end of time.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh my God, that is the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah? That's because you're beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Getting kind of cheesy, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You think that's cheesy? Buckle up.<br/>\n(Leonard gets down on one knee)<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh dammit, you topped it.</br></p>", "2642": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Apparently I have a reputation for being \"obnoxious\".<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Whaaaaaat?</p>", "2643": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> The doctor says you've got to get exercise.<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> I get plenty of exercise.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Crushing my will to live isn't exercise!</p>", "2644": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Anybody home?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey. What brings you guys here?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> We were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you'd like to join us.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why? Because Sheldon's not here this week and you don't think I have any other options -- I'm just kidding! I'll get my purse.</p>", "2645": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You make jokes about Sheldon but if it weren't for him, I don't think any of us would be sitting in in this room right now.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really? Sheldon not being here is the main reason I'm in this room.</p>", "2646": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't know if I wanna cook for him. He's kind of a picky eater. \"It's too salty. It's too dry. It's too burnt and frozen at the same time.\"</p>", "2647": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> (At Penny's door) Babe, open up.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm not talking to you.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Then who are you talking to? Babe?</p>", "2648": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> The one thing the William Shatner of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost.</p>", "2649": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> (Southern Accent) If y'all don't mind, I got a hankering for a lone star beer.<br/><strong>Mary:</strong> There's no alcohol in this household, stop talking like that, and lose the hat.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sorry, I'll take a diet yoo-hoo if you have one.<br/><strong>Mary:</strong> You'll take a Coke.</p>", "2650": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Lock up your daughters, we're going to hit it and quit it.</p>", "2651": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Kind of a \"Mars rover, Mars rover, can Howard come over?\" situation.</p>", "2652": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What I'm saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way. And obviously, my usual choices have not worked out so well.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Your last choice worked out for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod.</p>", "2653": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the PDF schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positroneum, well then, bippity boppity boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire.<br/>\n*Leonard shuts the door.*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.</p>", "2654": "<p><strong>Wolowitz: </strong> Qu'est-ce que 'sup?</p>", "2655": "<p><strong>Dr. Gablehauser:</strong> Okay, well, speaking of spreads, we're having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr. Kim who's agreed to join us here at the university.\n<br><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Of course he has.

You can see the matrix, can't you?\n</br></p>", "2656": "<p><strong>Leslie</strong>: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!</p>", "2657": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, this conversation is as pointless as your door knocking soliloquy?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Let me get my cockamamie keys.</p>", "2658": "<p><strong>Howard</strong>: Ooh, more details about the new Star Trek film! There is going to be a scene depicting Spock's birth.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> I'd be more interested in a scene depicting Spock's conception.</br></p>", "2659": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because I'm Frodo.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.</p>", "2660": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hope you're not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control. Because there's only one mind-expanding drug this man enjoys, and that's called school.</p>", "2661": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What are you doing here?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When last we spoke, you said you needed time.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> It's only been eleven hours.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The Lord of the Rings trilogy was nearly eleven hours. I made you watch that, you said it was an eternity.</br></br></br></p>", "2662": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, I'm confused. Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> There's just some things you don't do with your robot girlfriend.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Boy, when you met Bernadette, the field of robotics really took a hit.</p>", "2663": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You feel like driving to Arizona with me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I can't. I have that job interview.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, right.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Besides, I don't need six hours of \"Your hair is different. Why did you change your hair?

I didn't have anything going on. Plus, Penny told me we're married, and Thanksgiving is a time to be with family.</p>", "2667": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> This is all your fault! I should have listened to MunMun, because I've been playing with a cobra and her name is Penny! Why are you so cruel? Do you enjoy my pain?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> There's a girl at the cheesecake factory I can set you up with.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I LOVE YOU PENNY!</p>", "2668": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Awkward silence, Sheldon on his phone, no touching; somebody's having date night.</p>", "2669": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, not a lot of people know this. But the monoamine oxidase enzyme was discovered by a woman, Mary Bernheim.<br/>\n*Amy and Bernadette look puzzled by Penny's knowledge*<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's right, my phone is just as smart as you guys!</p>", "2670": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, it's not so bad.

My pee's like toothpaste.</p>", "2686": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you think I'm overdressed?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam? Yes. If you're playing Vegas, I'd add sequins.</p>", "2687": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Here comes Kripke.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Who's that with him?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I believe that's the president of the university.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!\n<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There is no abort.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How could you not put in an abort?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I made a boo-boo, all right?</p>", "2688": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> The great thing about Ernie (Sesame Street Puppet) is that he didn't ask for anything, he just gave.</p>", "2689": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (On computer screen) Hello, puny insects, as a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will, everyone is awarded one additional strike.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thanks a lot, Howard.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What are you complaining about?

Is this the Zack Johnson that used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny? Sorry to bother you.

When does this get fun?</p>", "2714": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look on the bright side.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's the bright side?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Only 9 more months to Comic-Con.</p>", "2715": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense. Let's say that I go out and I spend 50 dollars on you. It's a laborious activity because I have to imagine what you need whereas you know what you need.

I have such difficulty speaking to women, or around women, or at times even effeminate men.</p>", "2733": "<p><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Do you think I'd have rather been with you or sitting around for hours listening to my mother saying \"Have y'ever pee'd so much in your life?\"<br><strong>Rajesh:</strong> Oh, you are such a momma's boy.<br><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Don't bring my mother into this.<br/><strong>Rajesh:</strong> You brought your mother into this!</br></br></p>", "2734": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm fine. Although I'm no longer master of my own bladder.</p>", "2735": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why don't you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock.</p>", "2736": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This reminds me of a traditional Amish barn raising. With everyone pitching in.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> How exactly are you pitching in?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't hear anyone else giving facts about traditional Amish barn raising.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The rest of us are pitching in with hammers and nails.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, facts are my nails, and my voice is the hammer which pounds them through the wood of your skull.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, that is how it feels.</p>", "2737": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, I've kept you in suspense long enough. \"Dutch\" is a bastardization of the word \"Deutsch,\" meaning German.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What's German for \"annoying\"?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nervig. Why do you ask?</p>", "2738": "<p><strong>President Siebert:</strong> So, there are some funds left in the general administrative grant, and I need somebody to decide how we should disburse them.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? Wow, what an honor. Thank you. So how do I decide who gets the money?<br/><strong>President Siebert:</strong> How do you decide anything? Think about it with your brain, and then say it with your mouth.</p>", "2739": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What is going on with you?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's not a big thing. Have you ever told Leonard a little white lie?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mm. Well, he thinks I've seen every one of the Star Wars movies, but I've really only seen the one with the gold robot.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That could be any of them.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Exactly.</p>", "2740": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, I've narrowed it down to three worthwhile projects, but I only have the money to fund one of them.

You know what would be neat? If this was some sort of long con and one day you say, \"Let's make this interesting,\" put money on it, and reveal that you actually know what you're doing. [Leonard makes his move] A very long con indeed. Checkmate.</p>", "2743": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Where does Sheldon think you are?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, Sheldon's kind of like a dog, he doesn't really think about me when I'm gone, but he's so happy when I show up.</p>", "2744": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, my God, you look amazing.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I find you guilty of murder, because you are killing it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (imitating Sheldon) Well, technically, the Supreme Court wouldn't determine a defendant's guilt or innocence in a criminal matter. They could only reverse or revamp a jury's conviction based on a constitutional or statutory issue.</p>", "2745": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You're sitting in my spot.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You don't have a spot. What is wrong with you today?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Maybe he's cranky because he's off his bathroom schedule.</br></p>", "2746": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, do you think I'm always correcting other people?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, not all the time. I mean, just last week, Penny ended a sentence with a preposition. You didn't even mention it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> True. I just waited until I got home and screamed into a pillow.</p>", "2747": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Is something bothering you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard dressed up as me and imitated me, and everyone laughed.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh. Well, that must have felt terrible.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It did. I never realized my friends viewed me as an object of ridicule.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, I don't think that's true.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They laughed, Amy. In a derisive way. Not in the instructive way I laugh at them when they're being stupid.</p>", "2748": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> No, it does matter. Okay? You were right. It was Halloween. I was dressed as a cat, you were a hobbit. It was right there on that couch.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why didn't you just say that?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Because I always hated that was our first kiss. I was drunk, and I was still with Kurt, and I was using you to make myself feel better. I just wanted our first kiss to mean something. That's why I said it was the one on your birthday.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I like that. We'll make that our official first kiss.</p>", "2749": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, guys, I need your help. Bernadette's still pretty upset about your costumes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She's upset? Those pants I wore to make fun of you were so tight, I risked a testicular hernia.</p>", "2750": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> She's not. It's been happening my whole life. And-and she called me out for being mean? Well, I've had to be mean. It's hard to be taken seriously when you're always the smallest person in the room.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know that. I was in high school when I was nine years old. I tried to tell the other kids that although my physical stature was small, my intellectual stature towered over them. That only seemed to make things worse.</p>", "2751": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Who's Tam?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He was my best friend in the whole world growing up.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really? Why have I never heard you mention him before?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, of course I have. I'm sure I've mentioned him, like, five times this week.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't think you have.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Tam! Tam! Tam! Tam! Tam! There, it's only Thursday.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I didn't just drink the crazy milk, I bought the crazy cow.</p>", "2752": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, did you guys know that Sheldon had a best friend growing up named Tam?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Was that the imaginary talking koala?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No. He's a real person who apparently betrayed him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, so did the koala.</p>", "2753": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I tried to ask him about it, and he invoked section three, article five of the marriage contract: beeswax comma none of your.</p>", "2754": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Wow. I wonder what that guy could've done to make Sheldon not talk to him for 20 years.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I wonder if it'd work a second time.</p>", "2755": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, listen, I'm really worried about this whole Raj thing.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I know, he's so desperate to get married, which is weird, because I can't imagine we make it look that great.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know, right?</p>", "2756": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, I could ask my dad. Maybe he can get some of his old cop buddies to do a background check on her.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Would he do that?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Of course. He's a retired cop who plays by his own rules. [on the phone] Hi, Daddy. No, everything's good. I just have a favor to ask. Yeah, so, my friend Raj is marrying this woman that he barely knows, and I wanted to see if you could use your connections to dig up any dirt on her. Uh-huh. Sure. Okay. Love you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Is he in?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Absolutely not. He won't do it. It's totally illegal.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I thought you said he played by his own rules.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> He does, but apparently, they're very similar to the actual rules.</p>", "2757": "<p><strong>Georgie:</strong> Yeah, sure, I remember Tam, Sheldon's little Vietnam buddy. The two of them were always running around together.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, what happened?<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> What do you mean?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I mean, Sheldon never talks about him. They haven't spoken in years. He wasn't at the wedding.<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> He wasn't? All right, well, this is embarrassing, 'cause I had a long conversation with someone who I thought was Tam.</p>", "2758": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Wait, wait, so you don't know what their fight was about?<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> I wish I could help you, boys. But, you know, Sheldon used to keep an enemies list when he was a kid.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, he still does.<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> Really? I figured that went the same way as his bathroom schedule.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> If you mean digitized, annotated and put online, it did.<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> Maybe that'll tell you something. Hey, while you're looking at it, if I'm still on there for peeing in his shampoo bottle - Eh, you know what, just leave it.</p>", "2759": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, got his enemies list. Ooh, he updated the interface. You can search by first name, last name or length of grudge.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Is Tam on it?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Let's see. Yep. Right here. Tam Nguyen. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, great. What did he do?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hold on. I have to agree to the terms of service. No, I'm not a robot. Okay.<br/>\n\"Which of these are plants?\" And we're in.</p>", "2760": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When I moved to California, what did you do?<br><strong>Tam:</strong> I stayed in Texas.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you believe this guy?!</br></p>", "2761": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So, he was your best friend growing up?<br/><strong>Tam:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Were there no other kids in Texas?</p>", "2762": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard, today is your lucky day. Leonard's out, you're my new best friend. Well, I'm not thrilled about it either, but here we are. Okay, fine. Is Bernadette there? Sh- No? Just Stuart? Let me call you back.</p>", "2763": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, I'm Leonard Hofstadter. I called you about the apartment. You said-<br/><strong>Tam:</strong> Tell him to go away. You already have a roommate.</p>", "2764": "<p><strong>Tam:</strong> New neighbor?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, hi.<br/><strong>Tam:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Tam:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hi.</p>", "2765": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Tam, look. Sheldon's hugging me.<br/><strong>Tam:</strong> It's a Saturnalia miracle.</p>", "2766": "<p><strong>Tam:</strong> Sheldon, come here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Bazinga!</p>", "2767": "<p>[After montage of classic <em>The Big Bang Theory</em> moments with Tam as Sheldon's roommate]<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, my life would've still been great.</p>", "2768": "<p><strong>Tam:</strong> I didn't mean to upset you. And I want you to know I'm really proud of everything you've done.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you. It did work out for me. And I'm sorry that things didn't work out for you.<br/><strong>Tam:</strong> They did work out for me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Tam, you don't need to be brave on my account.<br/><strong>Tam:</strong> I'm not. I have a great wife and amazing children. I'm very happy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Brave, brave Tam.</p>", "2769": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm glad you guys made up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I realized my life turned out great, and it's silly to hold a grudge.<br/><strong>Tam:</strong> And I had no idea we were fighting, so it was easy.</p>", "2770": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're awfully quiet.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sorry.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I like it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Got a lot on my mind.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would you like to talk about it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not really.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Grape Nuts for breakfast, quiet car ride, things are really breaking my way today.</p>", "2771": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey. Wait a minute, what about us? I mean, we're married now. Maybe we want to buy the house next door.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, Amy, we can't move. I'd have to change all the tags in my underwear.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You can buy new ones.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> New house, new underwear. What am I, in the Witness Protection Program?</p>", "2772": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You're really letting your father pick out a wife?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why not? Arranged marriages have been working for thousands of years. Anu and I come from similar backgrounds, our families get along and we each filled out questionnaires, so we know we're not wasting our time with someone who's not compatible.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that sounds so dry and clinical.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You lucky duck.</p>", "2773": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Enjoying your book?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So much.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why do you keep poking at it?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Fine, I'm shopping on my phone.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're the one who said you wanted to read more.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yes, I also tell people I only feed the kids organic. It's just stuff you say.</p>", "2774": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Next question. Uh, \"how close are you with your family?\"<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Pretty close.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm gonna say not too close, but I'm hoping to get farther.</p>", "2775": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> \"How are you with pets?\" Well, I did take care of Sheldon for 15 years, and he only bit me twice.</p>", "2776": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, not everyone needs to have kids to be fulfilled.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're right, you've got Leonard. What more do you need?</br></p>", "2777": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I, for one, applaud Raj's decision to forgo emotional attachment and find a life partner by bowing to a 3,000-year-old authoritarian tradition.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you talking about? You married a woman you're in love with.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't believe you're throwing that back in my face.</p>", "2778": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, Leonard and Penny are our best friends. They know us better than anyone. They said it's the perfect gift. We must be missing something. You don't think it's a marital aid, do you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't be silly. Amy, how is this big glass shaft going to aid our marriage?</p>", "2779": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Let's just go to sleep. We'll look at it in the morning with fresh eyes, and maybe it'll come to us.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Or we go tear apart that box and look for a clue.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Staying up past my bedtime and solving mysteries? Who knew married life could be this good?</p>", "2780": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard, I don't often say this, but, good, you're here.</p>", "2781": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now, do you know what Leonard and Penny got us for our wedding gift?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't answer. I don't want to know. I just want to know if you know.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I do know.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, great. I believe that Amy and I have figured it out. Is it a clue to a scavenger hunt that will lead us to the actual present?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> If you're asking if you and Amy should spend the next couple days running all over town searching for the next clue, I'm gonna have to say yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I knew it! This is so much fun.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, it really is.</p>", "2782": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Hello?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, Dad.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Rajesh. What a nice surprise, calling me on my birthday.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes. That's why I'm calling. And-and what better gift to give you than the gift of marrying an Indian woman, just like you've always wanted.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> My goodness, Rajesh, this is exciting news. Who is she?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You tell me.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I want you to arrange a marriage for me. I'm just so tired of being single, and I'm finally just I'm-I'm ready to settle down.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> I can't just call up some girl's dad and make her marry you. It's-it's not 2015 anymore.</p>", "2783": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> We wrote you a special thank you note.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are those words?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. It's a secret code that you two get to figure out together.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hint: it's based on Sanskrit, but not the Sanskrit you're thinking of. (laughs)<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And best of all, you can't use the Internet to cheat.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Because we locked you out of your Wi-Fi, and the answer to this is your new password.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm no longer happy.</p>", "2784": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Do you still want to go out with me?<br/><strong>Denise:</strong> Absolutely. Hey, maybe we can go find Nemo together.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> That's a good one.<br/><strong>Denise:</strong> Do your 63 other crayon friends know you're out?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Are you just gonna make fun of me all night?<br/><strong>Denise:</strong> Probably.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong>  Great. So what are we thinking, Chinese?<br/><strong>Denise:</strong> Yeah, I'm in the mood for orange chicken.</p>", "2785": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Sounds like someone's in there.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> My God, what if Sheldon and Amy are getting robbed?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Or worse, what if they're back early?</p>", "2786": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, you compared us to the strangest couple we know, and we know Amy and Sheldon, Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his twitchy little dog.</p>", "2787": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How's this for a compromise? Make all the schedules you want, just don't tell me about them.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excellent. I'll create an algorithm that'll generate a pseudo-random schedule.<br/>\nYeah, and do you know why it won't be a true random schedule?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Because the generation of true random numbers remains an unsolved problem in computer science.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Come with me.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Where are we going?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> To the hotel room. And when we get there, I'm gonna need you to say that again, except naked.</p>", "2788": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you having an allergic reaction to my boutonniere?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. I'm just so happy for you. And for me. After today, you are officially - and, more important, legally - Amy's problem.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't be silly, Leonard. I will always be your problem.</p>", "2789": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's something I need to tell you. Wow, you look amazing! That's not what I need to tell you. But you do!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What's wrong?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Something incredible just happened. Remember when you were telling me about my bow tie and how a little asymmetry is good?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yeah?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My equations have been trying to describe an imperfect world, and the only way to do that is to introduce imperfection into the underlying theory.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So, instead of super symmetry, it would be super asymmetry?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (gasps) Super asymmetry. That's it! Give me your lipstick.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just give it to me, you beautiful thing! We have work to do!</p>", "2790": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I-I thought Wil was marrying us.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wolowitz got us an upgrade.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Another sci-fi guy with a beard. Seems lateral, but okay.</br></p>", "2791": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, when I was a little girl, I used to dream about my wedding. But, eventually, I stopped, because I thought that day would never come. And then I met you. From the first moment in that coffee shop, I knew that there was something special between us, even though I did work on a study that disproved love at first sight.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I loved that study the moment I read it. Ironic, huh?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Clearly, it was wrong. Because I felt something that day, and those feelings have only gotten stronger with time. I can't imagine loving you more than I do right now.<br/>\nBut I felt that way yesterday and the day before yesterday and the day before that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is that growth linear or accelerating?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Accelerating.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, maybe we could graph it out.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Save something for the honeymoon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Smart.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I don't know what the future holds, but I know that I've never been happier than I am in this moment marrying you.</p>", "2792": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, maybe it's fine if she doesn't come to the wedding. I've got Amy now, and she can do everything a mom can do and more.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Say that to her on the wedding night. Really spice things up.</p>", "2793": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello. Room service? I'm calling about the club sandwich on your menu. No, I-I don't want one. I just want you to spell it correctly. Unless the \"club\" is the Poor Typing Club. Okay. Now let's discuss this 15% \"gratooty\"? Yeah, well, that was rude. [hangs up] Someone just lost their gratooty.</p>", "2794": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I would like you at my wedding.<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> Thank you, Sheldon. That is so nice to hear. But I would rather swallow a pregnant wildcat and crap out a litter of kittens.</p>", "2795": "<p><strong>Georgie:</strong> Hey, you've reached George Cooper. Please leave a message. Unless this is Sheldon again, in which case, please try me on my other number, 1-800-suck-it.</p>", "2796": "<p><strong>Georgie:</strong> After all my sacrifices, guess which kid my mom is the most proud of?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If it makes you feel any better, my mom's most proud of Sheldon, too.</p>", "2797": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So with this level of high-power laser array, we would actually be able to solve the black hole information paradox once and for all.<br/><strong>President Siebert:</strong> That's impressive, and how much funding were you looking for?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> $20 million.<br/><strong>President Siebert:</strong> Really? You think you can build that for $20 million?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not a chance.<br/><strong>President Siebert:</strong> I'm sorry, then why are you asking me for it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because once you've spent $20 million, you're much more likely to give me an additional 50.<br/><strong>President Siebert:</strong> So actually, what you're saying is with $70 million, you can build this.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can see why you'd think that, but no. You can't go to the board of trustees and say you gave Sheldon Cooper $70 million and have nothing to show for it. No, the only way you'd be able to save face is to double down.<br/><strong>President Siebert:</strong> So 140?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And then double again.<br/><strong>President Siebert:</strong> 280?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And then - good news - not quite double again. So, uh, what do you say? We have a deal?</p>", "2798": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, do you know how that makes me look?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Uh, that's an easy one: bad.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, why didn't you tell her that you didn't like the dress, either? I mean, what happened to our united front?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm sorry. Is this your first day being a girl?</p>", "2799": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is it.<br/><strong>Pit Boss:</strong> Is everything okay, sir?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Hi. It's better than okay. I am a physicist, and I have been observing this wheel for hours and running a chi-square analysis, which is how I know that the ball is far more likely to land on 32, 17 or five. So if you could hold off on replacing this wheel, I'd like to make several large bets.<br/><strong>Pit Boss:</strong> Well, good for you. Pelican.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's pelican?<br/><strong>Pit Boss:</strong> Sir, would you come with us?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no. I have to place my bet first. This is for science. [carried away by security]<br/><strong>Croupier:</strong> 17 black.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No! No!</p>", "2800": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, of course I'm worried about you, I want you to be safe.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And I want you to be safe.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I will be. I'll have my friends with me. If anything should go wrong, I can use them as human shields.</p>", "2801": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> *knock knock knock* Dr. Wolcott? *knock knock knock* Dr. Wolcott? *knock knock knock* Dr. Wolcott? [sound of many locks clacking]<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's a lot of locks.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mm. That was a lot of knocks, they were made for each other.</p>", "2802": "<p><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> Well, let me show you around. This is the chair where I do most of my thinking, my thinking about work. Now, my thinking about people who have wronged me, I do over there.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've always said that I should get a grudge chair. Leonard, have I not always said that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mm, you have, but you were worried you'd spend too much time in it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah. That is a real concern.</p>", "2803": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you really know how to Riverdance?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You tell me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm the only man you do that for.</p>", "2804": "<p><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> Yeah, I'm a married man myself.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, really? Is she here?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And alive?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And can people other than you see her?</p>", "2805": "<p><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> Dr. Cooper, if you can promise me these men share your intellect and academic rigor, yeah, I suppose they can join us.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You guys might need to wait in the car.</br></p>", "2806": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Instead of being in charge, I can be the vocal opposition, criticizing and badgering the president at every turn.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I think you'll be really good at that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Me, too.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I think I made a huge mistake.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Me, too.</p>", "2807": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can smell that food truck from up here.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Just close the window if you don't like the smell.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course I like the smell. It's salt and fat. My brain may be evolved, but my tongue still wants to pick up a club and drag that truck back to my cave.</p>", "2808": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> The pastrami truck moved.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That is the danger of a restaurant on wheels.</p>", "2809": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, let me get this straight. You are the president of the tenants association?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> President, only member, and harshest critic. I once gave myself an official reprimand for conducting a meeting in the shower. The steam warped my gavel.</p>", "2810": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, uh, hold on. Hold on. First, we have to read the minutes from last month's meeting. Amy, would you do the honors?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why not? \"Saturday, March 3rd.<br/>\n7:05, meeting called to order.<br/>\n7:06, president gets shampoo in eye.<br/>\n7:07, meeting adjourned.\"</p>", "2811": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't want to be in the middle of this. No matter which way I vote, I'm either a bad friend, a bad fianc\u00e9e, or an ungrateful recipient of a battery.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Next time I have a meeting in the shower, you're welcome to attend.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon. Sheldon for president. I pick Sheldon!</p>", "2812": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Now, if you'll excuse me, told Sheldon I was going to the market, so I'm taking some of your stuff. [raids the fridge] I was never here.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sometimes you don't see it 'cause she's next to Sheldon, but she's pretty weird.</p>", "2813": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> But why do they still call Batman using the Bat-Signal? Wouldn't it just be, like, easier to text him?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The Bat-Signal isn't just to alert Batman, it's also to strike fear in the hearts of his enemies and let them know he's coming.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sort of like Sheldon's knock.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Comparing me to Batman? I'll take it.</p>", "2814": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know what they say, fool me \"N\" times, where \"N\" equals the amount of times you've already fooled me, shame on you. Fool me \"N\" plus one times, shame on me.</p>", "2815": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, M-Mr. Gates, I'm-I'm Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. We've actually met before.<br/><strong>Bill Gates :</strong> Sorry, I don't remember.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You were so nice, a-and it was really special to me because you've been such a big influence on my life. I mean, ever since I was a little kid, I've looked up to you like-like a hero. (sobbing)<br/><strong>Bill Gates :</strong> Oh, now I remember. Would you like a tissue?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How about a hug?<br/><strong>Bill Gates :</strong> How-how about a tissue?</p>", "2816": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, I'm really happy with our wedding date. The month squared equals the square of the sum of the members of the set of prime factors of the day. Isn't that romantic?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes, it's like that Shakespeare sonnet, \"Shall I compare thee to a day that's also a really weird math problem.\"</p>", "2817": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you guys have a location yet? 'Cause you don't have a lot of time.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, it took us nine months to pick a date, and a week to decide if brains can have lips on them, so get in the boat and row.</p>", "2818": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Honestly, it's gonna be hard when we both go back to work. I've been thinking maybe it would be better if one of us decided to stay home.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know, I was raised by servants, and look at me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I literally can't tell if you think that's good or bad.</p>", "2819": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, so, look, I'm here to ask you to give Sheldon and Amy the Athenaeum for their wedding.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> (laughs) Why would I do that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because deep down, Barry, you're a really good guy.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> But am I?</p>", "2820": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, we're gonna start with some nice breathing exercises. (inhales, exhales)<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sorry. I can't think of anything except how flat your belly is.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, thank you.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Go put on some more clothes, you bitch.</br></p>", "2821": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I can't believe her. She knows I don't want to name the baby after her dad.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What did you want to name him?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. We were gonna wait until we saw what he looked like.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, it's a baby. Her dad's a wrinkly bald man. That wasn't gonna break your way.</p>", "2822": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Bernie, this is our kid's name. I think we should both agree.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're right. We both made this baby.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> And I carried it, had to stay in bed for four months, sacrificed my body and my job, and soon it's gonna burst its way out of me like the Kool-Aid Man.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Exactly. Fifty-fifty.</p>", "2823": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What about Sherman? Like, Sherman Wolowitz.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, that's a kid who's gonna take his mother to prom.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, Howard, you did that, right?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I didn't take her. She chaperoned. (chuckles) We slow-danced once.</p>", "2824": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You know what, maybe we should go.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Did you have another contraction?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No. I'm just worried that Sheldon's gonna say \"mucus plug\" again.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And I'm worried one's gonna hit me in the eye.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yep, it's time.</p>", "2825": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, everything okay?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah! The baby was born about an hour ago.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (gasps) Dude, why didn't you call me?!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (chuckles) The only way I would see my son for the first time and immediately think \"I need to call Raj\" is if he came out brown.</p>", "2826": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Amy. Good, you're here.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hi. What's up?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How would you like to be on television?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Is it gonna be a news story where I have to say you were quiet and kept to yourself and I'm as shocked as anyone?</p>", "2827": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> [on TV] It's time for Professor Proton's science joke of the day. Why can you not trust atoms?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> [on TV] Because they make up everything.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that's funny! Yeah, because they do. They make up everything.</p>", "2828": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I thought you were boycotting Wil's show.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was, but I decided to give it a shot, and I actually enjoyed it. Just out of curiosity, how did you come to be on the show? Did he ask you? Did you ask him? Did you just show up on the set and ring that doorbell?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, if you want to be on the show, you're gonna have to apologize to Wil.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That would be the mature thing to do. Let's put a pin in that and keep thinking.</p>", "2829": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe it is a little like Penny. Any chance she'll be flattered?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't know. She's pretty mean.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ilsa or Penny?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Exactly.</p>", "2830": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm all for promoting women in science, but I don't really want to be on Wil's show.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is it because kids may be there, and they're known carriers of head lice? I get that.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sure, that's the reason.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait a minute. You're always bragging that lice aren't attracted to you because your scalp is so oily. That was on your dating profile.</p>", "2831": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't want my relationship with Amy to be like that.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon, Amy knew what she was getting into.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You think?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes, we warned her.</p>", "2832": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know what? It's fine. Write whatever you want. And by the way, Logan Dean can tell everyone he's five-eight, but he's not fooling anybody!</p>", "2833": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I mean, I-I didn't intend to write about Penny, but I guess maybe subconsciously I did.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong>   I believe you mean \"unconsciously,\" dear.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, sure. You know, it would be nice if you didn't correct me all the time.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong>    It would be nice if I didn't have to.</p>", "2834": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did Bernadette even try to send us a sewing kit?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> She did. Amazon, standard shipping, not even Prime.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (gasps) We could've done that ourselves.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (chuckles) That's what she said.</p>", "2835": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, what's the next test?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Loyalty. We need to choose someone who has our backs, someone who will keep our secrets even from each other.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I don't have any secrets from you. Do you have secrets from me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. Oh, that has been weighing on me for years.</br></p>", "2836": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, quick. I need you to get me to Arcadia within the hour. The train store's having a sale.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why can't Amy drive you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because of the tradition that I cannot see Amy on the day of the train store sale.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Please, please see a doctor.</p>", "2837": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So I was talking to my favorite aunt-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aunt Doe, right?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Exactly.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Did she ever figure out what that thing on her knee was?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Turns out it was a chocolate chip.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hmm. Makes sense, she does like to bake.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes, she does. Damn, you are a thoroughbred.</p>", "2838": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard, I've had my eye on this limited edition Swamp Thing, but now that I'm about to buy it, I'm having second thoughts. What do you think?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know, Sheldon, it's pretty expensive.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, but what if it will make me happy, you know, waking up and seeing it every morning for the rest of my life?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really, a walking clump of swamp grass?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, well, Bernadette's no prize either!</p>", "2839": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, and Amy gave me this plastic ring and told me to hold on to it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I got one, too.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, same.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, me, too. But-but Cinnamon ate it. I-I'll get it back tomorrow.</p>", "2840": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You're still working on Sheldon's dumb brain teaser?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, my God, Dr. Purple's a woman! Of course! Oh, that feels so good.</p>", "2841": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You picked Stuart over one of us?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I wanted to choose one of you, but you all turned against me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Picking a best man isn't about keeping score.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But you're all my friends. I mean, if I didn't collect data, how could I possibly choose among the three of you?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, that's actually kind of sweet.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is it? Well, then, perhaps I said it wrong.</p>", "2842": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, this is your wedding, just pick whoever you want. You don't need to worry about anyone else but yourself. You've kind of been training for this your whole life.</p>", "2843": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> And Amy's your best friend. I'm sure she'll come to her senses and pick you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, she's not my best friend. We're not 12. If she wants Bernadette to be her maid of honor, I really don't care.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sounds like you care.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, I mean, it-it's just annoying. You know, we talk every day. We see each other all the time. She's always there for me, and basically-- oh, my God, Amy's my best friend.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You okay?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, my best friend didn't ask me to be her maid of honor. I'm pissed!</p>", "2844": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, I know this is your wedding, and you can do whatever you want, but if you think anyone but me is gonna be your maid of honor, then you're an idiot because you are my best friend.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Too late, Bernade-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (pushes Howard out of the way, rushes to hug Penny) Bestie!</p>", "2845": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My mother is pushing for my brother, Georgie, to be my best man, and I hate to disappoint her again. I already rejected her savior and her LinkedIn invitation.</p>", "2846": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> She's actually been keeping herself busy doing wedding research for you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, she-she doesn't have to do that.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She wants to. After all, you were her maid of honor.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, tell your funny story about pretzels.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, right. Yeah, oh, yeah. Did you know that we've been thinking of having pretzels at our wedding? Hmm? No, no. No, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry. No, rhinos. We're having rhinos at our wedding.<br/>\nNo! (stammers) I got to go.</p>", "2847": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm gonna need some help. Someone baby-proofed the front door.</p>", "2848": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, I'll use real people. Um, if a certain dog-like loyalty is useful, then it's Leonard, hmm? If, uh, having a PEZ dispenser filled with TUMS is an advantage, Wolowitz, yeah. If a best man with fake testicles hanging from his truck is important, well, then, my brother's back in the running.</p>", "2849": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> He means he's writing a book.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I do. It's something I've been thinking about for a long time. Yeah. It's about a brilliant physicist who solves crimes using science.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Leonard-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not about you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He probably has to say that for legal reasons.</p>", "2850": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What did you need the kit for?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, um Sh-Sheldon was squatting down to pick up a fork and he ripped his pants.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, someone's gonna be sore tomorrow.</br></p>", "2851": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Penny gets 20 points for the sewing kit.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, minus five, because this is mine.</p>", "2852": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I know we only have coitus on my birthday, but I don't know if I can wait until midnight.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, well, you'll be glad you did. Everyone knows the best foreplay is rigid adherence to a strict schedule.</p>", "2853": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So this is for Amy's birthday. Can I leave it here?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure. What is it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A butter churn.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aw, that's what I got her.</p>", "2854": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And then after dinner, we will have birthday coitus.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Do you think that will also be historically accurate?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I assume like the rest of frontier life, it'll be exhausting and short.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're exhausting and short.</p>", "2855": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Did the electricity go out?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know what you mean by \"electricity,\" ma'am. I am just a farmer boy living in a little house on the prairie.</p>", "2856": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Is that butter?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. But don't blow it all on one biscuit. Took me nine hours to make that. I think I got churner's elbow.</p>", "2857": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Feel any better?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I feel terrible. Well, should we make love now?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> How can you even think about sex?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, I'm a man; I have annual needs just like anyone.</p>", "2858": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, how long have you been working on this?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, couple hours. I took a break to try to beat my high score on Mario Kart.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, did you do it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you see it on the board?</p>", "2859": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's just a day trip, but we could take the ferry out to Catalina.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Great, let's do it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (rushing in to the apartment) Amy's in the bathroom and I need to - (retches, bathroom door shuts, vomits loudly)<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's like I can hear the ocean already.</p>", "2860": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How are you feeling?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Ugh. My stomach aches, I got the chills, my mouth tastes weird, it hurts to swallow, and I've got a little double vision.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah. I'm feeling better, too.</p>", "2861": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, Amy, you're up. Next decision.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Come on, first dance! Come on, first dance!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (runs computer randomizer) Invitations! Oh! That's a good one. Just a suggestion, hologram projected out of R2-D2.</p>", "2862": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Your turn.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (runs randomizer) Ring bearer! Oh boy, I'm so glad that R2-D2 is still available.</p>", "2863": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, let's see what we've got so far.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I arrive in a Little House on the Prairie style horse-drawn buggy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Where you are met with an honor guard of stormtroopers.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you think that might be jarring, going from wholesome pioneers to space Nazis?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I see what you're saying. You're thinking that you should arrive in a replica of Luke Skywalker's landspeeder.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's not what I'm thinking, and to save you the trouble for the future, it will never be what I'm thinking.</p>", "2864": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, if we're changing things, then instead of throwing confetti, we'll release butterflies.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Airborne worms?! Have you lost your mind?! Well, if you're going to do that, then I am changing the officiant to that husky Spider-Man that hangs out at the Chinese Theater.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Fine. Wedding toasts in Latin.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Great. Vows in Klingon.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Then I'm changing the flower girl to a dog. And guess what he'll be scattering instead of petals!</p>", "2865": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What do you think will make the wedding worse for Amy, a cake made with salt instead of sugar or a cake iced with congealed gravy?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> That is a trick question. The answer is: you as the groom.</br></p>", "2866": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Neither of them will be the actual cake. I'm just using it as a bargaining chip to get Amy to agree to the whole wedding party getting rings and us getting one ring to rule them all.</p>", "2867": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, what's going on with your hair?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, nothing. I just decided to stop straightening it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, so you were making your hair look like that on purpose?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> When I first moved to America, I wanted to fit in. And Howard's hair was straight, and he was the coolest person I knew.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Then you never saw any other people?</p>", "2868": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I had a falling out with Raj. He said I make fun of him too much and it's wrecked his confidence.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Please, confidence is like red blood cells: it's nice if you got some, but you don't need 'em.</p>", "2869": "<p><strong>Clerk:</strong> Here's your license. Now, if you wait over there, we'll call you when the officiant's ready.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do we need a blood test?<br/><strong>Clerk:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, then, how will you know whether or not we have syphilis?<br/><strong>Clerk:</strong> I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you don't have that.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, Sheldon, you officially exceeded the number of times I hoped to hear the word \"syphilis\" on my wedding day.</p>", "2870": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I can't believe we're doing this.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know. I'm getting married. The new Star Wars movie's coming out. We are really finishing this year strong.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, but of the two of tho- You know, I'm not even gonna ask. I'm not gonna ask.</p>", "2871": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Can you believe it? We're about to walk in that door, Dr. Cooper and Dr. Fowler, and walk out as a married couple, Dr. Cooper and Dr. Fowler.</p>", "2872": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I want a real wedding.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, Sheldon, it was just making us fight.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know. But, Amy, I never thought I'd want to marry anyone. So the fact that I found you is astonishing. It's-it's like finding dark matter, except they're looking for dark matter. I wasn't even looking for you. S-So you're even better than dark matter.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (chuckles) Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Plus, plus, you interact with light, so I can see you. And, also, you don't account for the missing mass in the universe. Oh, and-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, I think you're getting caught up on the ways I'm not like dark matter.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Right. Sorry.</p>", "2873": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, we did get dressed up and come all the way to City Hall.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What are you thinking?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have always wanted a permit to dispose of hazardous waste.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Let's do it.</p>", "2874": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Should we go congratulate him?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll do better than that, I'll give him constructive criticism.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Here's some constructive criticism: don't.</p>", "2875": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're gonna make me forget I've been stuck in bed while a baby uses my bladder as a kickball? <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, you had unprotected sex with Howard. You deserve to be miserable.</p>", "2876": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Howard doesn't mean anything by it. I think it's cultural. His people come from a very sarcastic village called Brooklyn.</p>", "2877": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I mean, it's not that I think we're living in sin, but I do like the idea that our next act of intimacy will be a legal requirement.</p>", "2878": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Wait, what's Bitcoin?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's a new online currency that's been developed. Uh, it's just like actual money, except you can't see it, hold it, or spend it on anything.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Sounds like the kind of money I'm familiar with.</p>", "2879": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'll buy some Bitcoin. I just came into a little extra money when my dad raised my allowance.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You don't have to buy Bitcoin. You can mine it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mine it? Like, mining gold?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sort of. There's a limited amount, and we find it not by tunneling into the earth, but by using a computer to solve complex mathematical problems.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So let me get this straight. We have to write an elaborate program in order to find a fake coin that we can't spend on anything?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That sounds fun.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, I'm in.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Staying up late, writing code, it sounds like a party.</p>", "2880": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So what are you gonna do with your share of the money?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, well, as a responsible adult, I'll put that money into a CD, wait for that CD to mature, and then buy a tiger.</br></p>", "2881": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How about you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, that depends on whether I tell Bernadette or not.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howard, I can hear you. The baby monitor is on.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I know. I was joking. I'm gonna put it in a college fund. (Mimes saying no)</p>", "2882": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Wow, I-I know you were single back then, but that is a lot of porn-<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Science! A lot of science.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wow, you were really into Asian science.</p>", "2883": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> Howard, what's going on?! Are you boys roughhousing?!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, we're not roughhousing! We're scientists! Scientists don't roughhouse!<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> Excuse me, Mr. Grown-up!</p>", "2884": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aw, man, what happened?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It crashed. It's been doing that lately. I think it's got a virus from all the music I've been downloading.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What kind of music?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Mostly Asian. Some oldies.</p>", "2885": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> Howard, I made cookies for you and your little friends!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> They're not my little friends, and we don't want cookies!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Actually, a cookie sounds good.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, we'll have cookies! Thank you very much!</p>", "2886": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's right. It must be on my old laptop.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, let's go.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, Bernie, you mind if I run to Leonard's and-<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Get a laptop full of money? Why are you still here?! Go, go, go!</p>", "2887": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You having a good day?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, I missed an audition because my computer broke, and I didn't get the e-mail. Would've been a perfect part for me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Was it waitress who ignores her customers? Because that's the role you were born to play.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Shut up and eat your burger.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Actually, it's a turkey club.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Didn't you order a burger?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I did, and yet here we are.</p>", "2888": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> It was a long time ago, we were broken up.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Which breakup was that? Was that the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, no. This might've been during the Comic-Con Dump-A-Thon.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You have names for our breakups?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, they would really blur together if we didn't.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The Comic-Con breakup's easy to remember because Leonard was the saddest Pikachu.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Right, and he wiped his nose on your cape, and then you were the saddest Darth Vader.</p>", "2889": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm so sorry to hear about you and Howard.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Thanks. I just didn't think he was the kind of guy who would be doing weird stuff online.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? Wow, I thought it was so obvious, but okay.</p>", "2890": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, I know it's hard, but I think the best thing to do after a breakup is to take some time and be by yourself.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, that's healthy.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Hey, babe, ready to go?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Do as I say, not as I do.</p>", "2891": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> *knock knock knock* Penny!  *knock knock knock* Penny!  *knock knock knock* Penny!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, go away. I'm making a video.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry. I'll come back when you're alone.</p>", "2892": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I went out with him because he's great. And if I kept going out with him, I probably would've married him, and that's a little scary because I just don't think I'm ready for that. You know, plus I have got to learn how to spell Hofstadter. I-I know there's a \"D\" in there, but it keeps moving every time I try and write it.</p>", "2893": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What, y-you stole our Bitcoin?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, calm down. All I did was sneak onto your computer and download your Bitcoin onto a flash drive.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not keeping it. I just wanted to watch you sweat.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> If you want to watch him sweat, walk up a flight of stairs with him.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've waited seven long years, but it finally happened.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where's our money?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's the best part. It's on the Batman flash drive on your key chain. You've had it in your pocket all along.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon I lost that key chain years ago.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? D-D-Did you look under things?</p>", "2894": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Huh. What's that? Ooh, Batman flash drive. Pretty cool. Huh, if I erase this, I could probably resell it for, like, ten bucks. Things are finally going my way.</p>", "2895": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I cannot believe you're mad.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm not mad.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, really? Tell that to your eyebrows. Bet I could place a quarter between them, and it would just stay there.</br></p>", "2896": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And worse than that, Edison filmed the first on-screen kiss, so he's basically a pornographer. Although every time I put that in Wikipedia, someone takes it out.</p>", "2897": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Whoa, whoa, whoa. You didn't tell me we were doing this just to stick it to Sheldon.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well-<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> I messing with you. This sundae just got a cherry on top!</p>", "2898": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, is Sheldon working on our project again?<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Did he say that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, he wouldn't tell us.<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Huh. So he can keep his mouth shut. How do I get him to do that?</p>", "2899": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can you believe they said I was just like Edison? Yeah, and in front of a lady, no less.</p>", "2900": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> All I'm saying is before you attack Ruchi, maybe you should take a long hard look in the mirror, because you know what you'll see, apart from radiant skin and luxuriously thick hair? Hypocrisy!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It is thick.</p>", "2901": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, how's Bernadette handling bed rest?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She lies around all day eating Mallomars and hollering at me, so her transformation from my wife to my mother is complete.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Congratulations. I know that's what you were hoping for.</p>", "2902": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, just give her some space, all right? Don't call, don't text, don't e-mail.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's crazy. What if I see a sunset that reminds me of her?</p>", "2903": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've been modeling different types of dark matter and the traces they would leave on the zircon inside your meteorite.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> What's this one here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's actually a dark matter model of my own creation. I call it the Cooper Boson.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Cool. I got to name a rock once. I named it Moderately Sedimented Shale. Guess I kind of pooped the bed on that one.</p>", "2904": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, this is serious. My reputation is on the line. What are people gonna think when they see us collaborating?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't know. Poor Bert?</p>", "2905": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Are you guys working together on that meteorite project?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (sighs) Yes, fine, you found me out. I'm doing geology. Just, please, don't tell anyone.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Are you embarrassed of me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no, no, no, not you. No, just the work that you've devoted your entire life to.</p>", "2906": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What's going on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What if there was something I wanted to do, but I was worried other people would think less of me?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Is that other person me, and does it happen in the bedroom, in which case I think I'm cool with it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. It's about working with Bert on - You know what? I'm not even gonna say it. I am just gonna say the letter it starts with and -\"ology\". G-- Oh, no, that's not gonna work.</p>", "2907": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, it should be a scientist I respect. You know, someone with a pleasing voice and symmetrical facial features.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Is he talking about himself?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> If he's talking, he's talking about himself.</p>", "2908": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They're going to start making Professor Proton's science show again.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I thought he passed away.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> He did. He was cremated, and his remains were put in a baking soda volcano.</p>", "2909": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> And rolling.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello. I am theoretical physicist, Dr. Sheldon Cooper, auditioning for the role of Professor Proton.<br/>\nNow, excuse me while I get into character. (Turns around and back. In the same monotonous voice) Hello, I am Professor Proton.</p>", "2910": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, what was wrong with it? You know, did you find it borderline psychotic? I mean, I liked that about it, but you guys discuss.</p>", "2911": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you remember when you were a kid and you'd watch Professor Proton?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, did he ever make you-- I don't know-- hate science and the people who do it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What are you saying?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I just think it would be better if your contempt for children wasn't so much in the foreground.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, you want me to lie?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, it's not lying. It's acting. Sheldon Cooper may not like kids, but Professor Proton loves them.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Interesting. You know, I hadn't really thought of it that way. It's similar to how I'm afraid of dogs, but my D&amp;D character likes dogs, you know? But he's allergic, so he can't be around them.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why don't we have a dog?</br></p>", "2912": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Hey, Sheldon. What's up?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I need an acting coach.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Oh.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would you give me Patrick Stewart's number?<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine, I guess you can do it.</p>", "2913": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ugh.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You okay?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. No, all these comments online about Wil, they're nothing but supportive and kind. Where's the mean, snarky Internet that shows up every time I get a haircut?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know that's us, right?</p>", "2914": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, luckily, I got the number of the company who's trying to reboot the show, so I need you all to call and register your displeasure.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon, no one's gonna do that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not true. I know of three calls they've received already: a Southern gentleman, um, a Cockney chimney sweep, and, uh, Mr. T, hmm? Who - spoiler alert - pities the fool who tries to reboot that show.</p>", "2915": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Did you ever consider that maybe Arthur would be happy to know that his show has outlived him?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I doubt it. He was kind of a mean old crank.</p>", "2916": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's fine, I've been driving him for years. What's one more day?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, and I've got a new car game we can play. It's called \"What siren am I?\"</p>", "2917": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Amy, your lab is amazing. A C-arm fluoroscope, a cranial ultrasound, (gasps), and look at that coffee maker!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I know. On our expense report, I listed it as \"Eduardo\", my Colombian lab assistant.</p>", "2918": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, you ready for your next one? Just a warning, this one's a little annoying. (imitates a high-pitched siren)<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Let's take a little little break, I'm getting a headache.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aw, right in the middle of our fun game.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, weird.</p>", "2919": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She's going to be home at \"eight-ish.\" Like, when is that? 8:01? 8:02? And what kind of scientist uses \"-ish\"?</p>", "2920": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I got you a little something to help you relax.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, that is the sweetest, most- What what is this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The notes from our quantum cognition project. I thought we could spend the evening grinding away on it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (sighs) I just got home, I'm tired.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of Howard, I know. So how about you and me make some beautiful science together?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I want to work on this with you, just not tonight. What if we get up early and do it in the morning? I promise, I'll be way more into it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know what? There was a time that you would've been happy to stay up and collaborate all night with me. And then wake up in the morning and do it some more.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (sighs) Fine, but can we make it quick?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. If you're just gonna make me do all the work, then go to bed. But don't be surprised if you walk out here and catch me doing it myself.</p>", "2921": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> At least he can still clean the oven, so that's something.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that's what he thinks. Where's your steel wool?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (picks it up from her lap) Right here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We make quite the team.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sure do!</p>", "2922": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> This is great, the two of us hanging out. Why didn't we think of this earlier?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Agreed. I don't need Amy to watch a movie. I can not hold your hand just as easily.<br/>\n(Sheldon starts the movie)<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In the book this is based on, that man's the killer.</p>", "2923": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Now, why don't you go wash up, and we'll call you when dinner's ready.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. (Sheldon leaves)<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (surprised) What did you do? Are you a witch?</p>", "2924": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's amazing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know. But, you know, it's only birth to five. What do we do when he turns six?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Take him to the zoo and leave him there.</p>", "2925": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You don't even have a license.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Actually, I do.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really? Since when?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Three years ago. I went on a bit of a license kick. I'm also a commercial fisherman.</br></p>", "2926": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> My mother's texting you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. We've been talking a lot lately.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why? She sick of talking to the magic mirror on the wall?</p>", "2927": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on. You can build things. You were an astronaut.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's true. You know, as a kid, I used to make model rockets. That'd be pretty cool to do with a son.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Model rockets. Finally, something interesting! What is your preferred mode of recovery?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, we're helping our friends.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And we got to model rockets, yeah? It was a tedious road, but well worth the effort.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So, have you thought of any names?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, we finally got to model rockets. Why are you turning back?</p>", "2928": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What's up?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Well, I enjoyed our conversation the other day, and I was hoping to continue it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Uh, yes. You may find this surprising, but I don't have a lot of what you would call girlfriends.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (exaggerated) What?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Of course, there are my female colleagues, but, uh, they're all Freudians, so the only boy that I can dish about is my father. (chuckles)</p>", "2929": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny doesn't know how manipulative my mother can be. Did you know there's such a thing as reverse, reverse, reverse psychology? Because there is.</p>", "2930": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, studies have shown that people distracted by emotional issues are poor drivers.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What about people distracted by irritating passengers?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That would be hard to test, because irritating is a subjective quality.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Strongly disagree.</p>", "2931": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I want to know, why aren't you proud of me?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Well, isn't the real question, \"Why aren't you proud of yourself?\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, that is a question - and I ask it a lot - but let's stick with the one I asked you.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> But why do you think I'm not proud of you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because you never say it. But two days into chatting with Penny, and you can't stop telling her how great she is.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> She is great. Honestly, of all of my children's spouses, she's the one that I'm most impressed by.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Seriously?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Yes. She's confident, she's thoughtful, and she never complained about you once. I know what kind of strength that takes.</p>", "2932": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Now you're gonna want to slowly switch lanes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Because there are only two, and you're not in either of them.</p>", "2933": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're a good teacher. Your son is going to be lucky to have you as a father.</p>", "2934": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> It's a date. Just pick one.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not just a date, it's a textbook optimization problem. There is a perfect date. Just like there's a perfect room temperature and a perfect dessert.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mm. There's no perfect dessert.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yellow cake in the shape of a dinosaur with chocolate frosting, a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side, not touching. You'll see. You'll have it at our wedding.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You wanna bet?</p>", "2935": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You give me enough time, I can do the same thing with a wedding date. It needs to be on the weekend, uh, not near any of your birthdays, or the weekend of Comic Con.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ooh, you could get married at Comic Con.<br/><strong>Amy, Penny and Bernadette:</strong> No!</p>", "2936": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, it's strange, Sheldon was talking in his sleep last night, and he seemed like a totally different person. He was relaxed and loose and calm.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, Sheldon's a complicated man.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> He said \"whatev.\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Give him a brain scan, that might be a tumor.</p>", "2937": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Is it possible that the sleep-talking is a part of your brain that's telling you everything's gonna be okay and you just need to relax a little?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So you're proposing that the self is an illusion, and that we actually have multiple centers of consciousness that are communicating with one another?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> In laymen's terms, yeah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Huh. Interesting. So you don't believe there's a Cartesian self that underlies the flux of experience?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Maybe in my twenties, not anymore.</p>", "2938": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When the toupee licked my hand I screamed and hopped down the street on my remaining flip-flop.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Can I just ask?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, this is a long story. Why don't we please save your questions till the end?</p>", "2939": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Is there anything I can do to help?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. I want you to be in charge of our wedding. Just you tell me where and when, and I will show up with a boutonnire and close-toed shoes and a a Star Trek uniform underneath my tuxedo. That last part is non-negotiable.</p>", "2940": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> The university has been throwing money at my study. With any luck, there'll be a brain disease with my name on it.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Fingers crossed.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Which is ironic, because if you had Fowler's palsy, you wouldn't be able to cross your fingers.</br></p>", "2941": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Should he be saying that?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, probably not.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, this is public radio. Doesn't he realize that dozens of people might hear him?</p>", "2942": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Huh. Looks like you've been busy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I have. Uh, dark matter, uh, reconciling gravity and quantum mechanics. Supersymmetry. I've figured out the biggest problems in physics today.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Wow, you solved them all?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I just, I figured out that they're the biggest problems.</p>", "2943": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> This is depressing. Do you have any alcohol around here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, not surprisingly, when Penny moved out, she took every last drop.</p>", "2944": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Lord, thank you. Even though you can do anything, that was mighty impressive.</p>", "2945": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It's for Sheldon and Amy.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> No way! They're engaged?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, that's exciting news. Who would've thought Sheldon and Amy would be the next two to tie the knot?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Tell me about it. I'm the one who caught the bouquet at Leonard and Penny's wedding.</p>", "2946": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Uh you know, they might like this. Superman and Wonder Woman, it's kind of romantic.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hmm. You know what? Why am I buying them a gift? They have love. Screw them and their happiness. What do you have for someone who's bitter and alone?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Literally everything.</p>", "2947": "<p><strong>Dr. Harris:</strong> Actually, I do have a question for Dr. Cooper. When Amy first told you about her approach to synaptic tracing, did you think it was gonna revolutionize the field?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? That's your question? What are you, Entertainment Tonight?</p>", "2948": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Those people were in the presence of a world-class mind, and all they wanted to talk about was their own nonsense.<br/><strong>Stephen Hawking:</strong> Can you see the irony in that statement? How about now? How about now? I'll wait.</p>", "2949": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I realized that Iron Man is great. And also, that Captain America is great. And sometimes, Iron Man is in a Captain America movie, and he's not mad it's not an Iron Man movie. You know, he can fly in, give the audience a thrill, and then fly away. And that should've been me tonight. I should've been the delightful cameo in your movie.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Thank you, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Instead, I was like the Hulk, and I-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, please stop talking about the Avengers.</p>", "2950": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on, looks don't matter to Sheldon. ... Because he only has eyes for you!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Nice try.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thanks, I was scrambling.</p>", "2951": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I've been smacking that ketchup bottle for a long time. All she has to do is tip it over and point it at her fries.</p>", "2952": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, this is making me crazy. Somebody's got to go over there. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You got feet and legs, you do it.</p>", "2953": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That was fun. It was like Mario Kart.</p>", "2954": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Not only did they eat together, Leonard said he made her laugh.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's nothing, Howie said she touched his hand.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Did he Purell?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I cannot believe Leonard mentioned the Toblerone but left that part out.</p>", "2955": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> First thing tomorrow morning, we're back at it.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Without me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I hope his character doesn't make it into the movie; he's kind of a bummer.</br></p>", "2956": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, why would you do that?<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> You guys completed phase one, we'll take it from here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Where did you move it?<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> I can't tell you that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you implementing phase two?<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> I can't tell you that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, so you're just going to take all the work we've done for the last year and toss us aside?<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> That one I can tell you, yes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> This is all very upsetting.<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> I'm sorry to hear that. As you know, the primary focus of the United States military is people's feelings.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If that's sarcasm, please save it for our enemies.</p>", "2957": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I was offered a summer research fellowship at Princeton.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Princeton? A fine institution. The place where Albert Einstein taught. And where Leonard got his PhD, so it may have gone downhill.</p>", "2958": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What does it look like? I'm playing sad harmonica in an apartment as empty as my heart.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I got the blues. My baby done left me.</p>", "2959": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, I know it's not your birthday, but if you're interested-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I am.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. Oh, and just to be clear, I'm not being intimate with you in order to keep you from going.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I wasn't thinking that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, no, it's just, I'm just warning you, you know, if you find yourself 3,000 miles away and craving a hit of this, you know I can't Skype it to you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's a risk I'm willing to take.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, then.</p>", "2960": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard pointed out to me that I'm not always a loving and supportive boyfriend, so here's some quality luggage.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The salesman said it could survive a plane crash, so perhaps you should fly inside it.</p>", "2961": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you think it's possible you might enjoy being on your own for a little while?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's hard to say. I've never really lived by myself. What if I become strange and eccentric?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'll love you no matter what.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard Hughes saved his urine in milk bottles.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.</p>", "2962": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I made your favorite oatmeal - plain.</p>", "2963": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, what's new?<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Oh, tons of stuff. Put artificial grass in my backyard, got engaged, had a scary mole that turned out to be Sharpie.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, congratulations.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> That's what my dermatologist said.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, on getting engaged, good for you.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Oh, thanks.</p>", "2964": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I started doing some reading on cognitive vitality, and I came across an area of research called \"super-aging.\"<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You know who's a super-ager? Jennifer Lopez. Like, what is her secret?</p>", "2965": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How is super-aging any different than, like, doing crossword puzzles?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, it's not just doing simple cognitive tasks. You need to push your brain out of its comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I drive you to work every day, my brain must look like the Hulk.</p>", "2966": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's a nice offer.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> You know, we'd make a great team. Or as we say in the menu business, I can't do this without Me N U.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Right, 'cause it spells \"menu.\"<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Yeah, right? It's funny. I got a lot of menu jokes, but that's my favorite.</p>", "2967": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> See, that wasn't so bad. He even picked up the check.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. Although, when he was trying to figure out the tip, I'm pretty sure I saw smoke coming out of his ears.</p>", "2968": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't you think it might be a little weird to work for someone you used to date?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You work with Sheldon, you tell me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, it's weird.</p>", "2969": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Have you tried letting go of the rope?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What, are you crazy? I'm on a unicycle.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> All right, well, have fun.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, I need help getting down.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, what do you want me to do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Drag out our mattress and put it over here, then go across the hall, get their mattress and put it over here. But before you do any of that, scratch my nose.</p>", "2970": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> His mother warned me. Everybody warned me. Actually, he warned me.</p>", "2971": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I can't believe you made fun of me all these years while you were a closeted ventriloquist.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay, it's not like I wanted to be a ventriloquist. I was in beauty pageants and I needed a talent besides spreading rumors that the other contestants were pregnant.</br></p>", "2972": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I didn't know you could drink while you were breastfeeding.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, they say the yeast in beer helps with milk production.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm pretty sure that's a myth. Let me check.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Ruin it for me, and I'll break this glass over your head.</p>", "2973": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You want food?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, breastfeeding burns, like, 5,000 calories a day. (To Amy) Do not touch that phone!</p>", "2974": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And welcome to a special retrospective, where we will take a look back at the history of Fun with Flags on an episode we're calling,<br/><strong>Both:</strong> \"Fun with Flags - Behind the Flags: A Retrospective.\"</p>", "2975": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Should we get lunch or you want to eat at the zoo?<br/>\n*Bernadette and Stuart staring at their phones*<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (imitating Bernadette):\"Oh, Howie, I don't need food as long as I can look at my phone.\"<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't like when you imitate me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You want to hear my Stuart? (imitating Stuart) \"It's been a while since I've gone on a date.<br/>\nYou mind if we watch the monkeys doing it?\"<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I said that to you in confidence.</p>", "2976": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> How about after this we go see the exotic bird show?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Not a good idea. My hair is a coveted nesting material.</p>", "2977": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Learning anything?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, sloth babies cling to their mothers' bodies for almost a year. I'm going back to work after only four months. So, I've learned I hate myself, I hate sloths, and I hate you for bringing me here.</p>", "2978": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What are you making?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Chicken. Birds mess with my hair, I come back hard.</p>", "2979": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, Bert, you were telling us how you updated your profile?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Right. I wasn't getting any responses, and then I added, \"Recent $625,000 MacArthur grant winner\", and five minutes later, I met my soul mate.<br/>\n*Amy goes to the hallway*<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I was wrong. You can come back in.</p>", "2980": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'd love a personal trainer. I haven't seen my abs since they opened a Shake Shack on my drive home.</p>", "2981": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who's ready to laugh?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (groans)<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. So Feynman, Einstein and Schrodinger walk into a bar. Feynman says, \"It appears we're inside a joke.\" Einstein replies, \"But only to an observer who saw us walk in simultaneously.\" To which Schrodinger says, \"If someone's looking in the window, I'm leaving.\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (chuckles) That's actually funny.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You should send that to Jimmy Fallon.</p>", "2982": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What are you doing here?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Can't a guy hang out at a college he doesn't go to and stare at a baby that isn't his?</p>", "2983": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What are you looking at?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Comments from our Behind the Flags retrospective. Get this, people are calling it \"the longest one yet\".</p>", "2984": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Sorry again for barging in.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You don't have to go. You're welcome to hang with us.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Actually, our friendship group is at capacity. But if anybody drops out, you're at the top of the list. Unless it's Raj, in which case, we'll probably get a person of color.</p>", "2985": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> B.R.B. That's short for \"be right back.\" I'm saving so much time!</p>", "2986": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, thanks again for letting me use your laptop last night.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No problem.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Was just doing my taxes.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Actually, if I could if I could just check one more-<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Already cleared the browser history.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> You're a good woman.</br></p>", "2987": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's okay, I'm just being emotional about this. Can you not tell Howard?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, don't you think it'd be healthier if you told him what's going on with you?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Don't you think it'd be healthier if you had your own apartment, grown man?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Your secret is safe with me.</p>", "2988": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, since when do you do laundry on a Thursday?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I had an accident at work, I slipped and fell on my soup sack.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, there was a time I would say \"What's a soup sack?\" But I'm glad we're past that.</p>", "2989": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, there was a time I would say \"God bless you,\" and then you would say \"If you must invoke an imaginary deity, how about Thor?\" And I would say, \"How do you know I didn't mean Thor?\" And then you would say \"Touche,\" and that there ends the tale of why I no longer say \"God bless you.\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, we have had some fun, haven't we?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, yeah.</p>", "2990": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, here we go. Six years ago, I got a call that Bernie's great-aunt, Trixie, died.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> And?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And I forgot to give her the message.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> That's terrible.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The terrible part is, ever since then, I've been sending Bernie Christmas cards from Trixie.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Howard!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Let me finish. And one card had five dollars in it I took from Bernie's purse.</p>", "2991": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Does this place look familiar?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's hard to say.<br/><strong>Bartender:</strong> Hey, Sheldon's back!<br/><strong>Everybody:</strong> Sheldon!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's getting clearer.</p>", "2992": "<p><strong>Bartender:</strong> Here you go.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, thank goodness!<br/><strong>Bartender:</strong> One top secret quantum guidance system.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You understood the math?<br/><strong>Bartender:</strong> No, but Sheldon told me all about it. He told everybody.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's just great.<br/><strong>Bartender:</strong> Oh, don't worry, he made us pinky swear we'd keep it a secret.</p>", "2993": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My pants are missing, I don't remember anything. Penny, this is your youth. What do I do?</p>", "2994": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, I felt the same way about the spork. Uh, solids and liquids handled by one utensil? That'll never work. Spoiler: works.</p>", "2995": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I felt the same way about the platypus. You know, bird and mammal in the same creature? No way. And spoiler: way.</p>", "2996": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How can he not remember a day?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, people who are abducted by aliens lose time. I mean, maybe it happens to the aliens, too.</p>", "2997": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Why don't you ask me what I'm working on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, very well. What have you been working on? And feel free to honk during the boring parts.</p>", "2998": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, it's just nice to be with people who are happy to have me around. Isn't that right, Halley?<br/>\n*Halley starts crying*<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, at least someone had the courage to say it.</p>", "2999": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> \"Revised ground rule number two: There are definitely stupid questions. And those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face.\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I love that one.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Thanks, babe.</p>", "3000": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> That's great. How so?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, the project is classified. I can't tell you. Oh, I suppose I could redact the classified parts. All right, um, I came up with an elegant solution to the (honks horn). I used the (honks horn) And then I (honks horn) And that did it. (honks horn)</br></p>", "3001": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Wait, are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations, we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It could be the most inspired combination since I mixed red Icee into my blue Icee. It was like drinking 2/7ths of the rainbow. <br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, this is really interesting. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah and this one won't stain my teeth purple.</p>", "3002": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> This isn't about me and Sheldon. This is about Rajesh moving in with Leonard and Penny.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Interesting. They've found a need to take yet another roommate. Seems they're avoiding some harsh realities themselves.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster. Boy, you're good.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> That is the word on the street, dear.</p>", "3003": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> And if my heart stops, just let me go.</p>", "3004": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm sorry, guys. Sheldon was upset, Leonard and Penny were fighting. I just wanted to go someplace where I wasn't causing problems.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (sighs) I'll say it again. India.</p>", "3005": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What if she's correct? Doesn't that say something troubling about us?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't know. I just think you're the kind of person who likes a contingency plan.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That is true. Did you know I figured out in which order I would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You need to stop hanging out with your brain so much. It's not a good influence.</p>", "3006": "<p>(Leonard standing outside the door to Sheldon and Amy's apartment)<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Help! Cinnamon's loose in the building!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Inside) Amy, quick, lock the door!</p>", "3007": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, it's like that science thing. For every action, you have a gigantic and annoying reaction.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just when I thought you couldn't get any hotter.</p>", "3008": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What's so funny?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Raj is looking for a cheap place to live, and I wrote \"India.\"<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Don't post that; be supportive.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe you should be supportive of my hilarious jokes.</p>", "3009": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> There are a lot of memories wrapped up in that room. For me, too. The first time you told me you loved me was in that room.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wrong. We were standing outside my room in the hallway.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And there is the love of which I speak.</p>", "3010": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Now we're going as Hulk and She-Hulk. I don't want to take my shirt off at Comic-Con.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If I may speak for Comic-Con, we don't want that either.</p>", "3011": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I thought your dad paid your cards.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I have a card for emergencies that I pay for myself.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What emergency happened at the L.A. Zoo?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's a penguin I sponsor. They're losing their homes to global warming, and my car gets, like, seven miles a gallon, so I felt bad.</p>", "3012": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, Double Stuf Oreos, I remember when I could afford you.</p>", "3013": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Please? I went to your boring thing last month.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> My aunt's funeral? <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on, even you checked your e-mail during the eulogy.</p>", "3014": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> It's not that I want to go, I just think it'll make Leonard happy. And if I have to watch him squeeze into an Ewok costume, so be it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Look at you, going to Comic-Con, talking about Ewoks. I really have become the cool one around here.</p>", "3015": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I can't believe Penny's gonna get to go, and I'm not.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You can always watch the panels online. Oh, boy, we do say that a lot.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> \"Panels.\" Just wanted to be included.</br></p>", "3016": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, so this is the main Comic-Con floor. It's where all the vendors and exhibits are.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, that is a lot of people jammed in there.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know. Sometimes Howard wears a striped shirt so we can play \"Where's Wolowitz?\"</p>", "3017": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Here's the hotel room we all share.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, you and I would get our own room, right?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Every hotel is booked. But, yeah, see this space here between Sheldon's feet and my head? That's where you go.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, it's no different than when Sheldon used to climb in bed with us during a thunderstorm.</p>", "3018": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> When you moved here, you didn't have a lot of money. How'd you get by?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from the neighbors. Just know you might have to marry one of 'em.</p>", "3019": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I got it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You really figured it out?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, but when we show this nonsense to Sheldon, it will make him crazy, and he'll have to fix it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, you're a genius.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, I know. That's not even a math symbol. That's just Charlie Brown's hair.</p>", "3020": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You know, I just read that a team at MIT developed a device that helps people read human emotions.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And you think we can get those guys to reprogram Sheldon? Cool.</p>", "3021": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, everybody has things that they need help with. Like me. I can't see without my glasses. And right now you're just a cute, pink smudge wearing a childish green smudge.</p>", "3022": "<p><strong>Lucy:</strong> Can I just say something? Going out with Raj was one of the best things that ever happened to me.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes, I'll take you back.<br/><strong>Lucy:</strong> It's like I needed to go through that experience to know what exactly I don't want in a man.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's hard to hear, but I'll still take you back.</p>", "3023": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny's gonna call her dad and tell him it's not a good time for Randall to visit.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hopefully, he won't be too upset.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, you're his little girl. He can't stay mad at you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> He won't be mad at me. I mean, you're the one who doesn't want my brother to come, so-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So you're gonna throw me under the bus?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I'm gonna throw you so hard, I might actually win a stuffed animal.</p>", "3024": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's going on with your brother?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> My dad asked if I can get him a job interview at my work.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Huh. Is that a good idea? I mean, you think they'll consider someone who was in prison for selling drugs?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I sell pharmaceuticals. That's just a really hard to spell word for drugs.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I'm sure he'll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon.</p>", "3025": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now, when the robots rise up, they'll know that I've been rooting for them the whole time.</p>", "3026": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Things going well with you and Sheldon living together?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Better than ever. He asks about my day, takes an interest in my life. He's like my boyfriend in college, except he's real, so people can see him.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I've been seeing him for years. I'm still not convinced he's real.</p>", "3027": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It looks like a map from Dungeons &amp; Dragons.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Mm. Except the creature in the crib is a level-nine poop monster.</p>", "3028": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you say?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I get to write a contract? I say, let's get this party of the first part started!<br/>\n(Amy enthusiastically laughs)<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Do you really think that's funny?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's in our agreement. I have to laugh.</p>", "3029": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> At our age, why don't we call it man's night?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because we just spent our allowance on comic books.</p>", "3030": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Pink wine and pizza bagels? It's like eighth grade all over again.</p>", "3031": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> See you guys at work.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Be there bright and early.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Not me, paternity leave.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh! A small human wreaks havoc on his wife's genitals and he gets time off.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> With pay, sucka!</br></p>", "3032": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It was fine, other than the weird-tasting juice Amy gave me. I slept the whole way.</p>", "3033": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, you know. The Lone Star state. That should be its Yelp rating.</p>", "3034": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Do boys have flowers?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Who knows what he has down there.</p>", "3035": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, it's Bernadette. She says they're running late. \"The baby threw up on Howard, and then Howard threw up on Howard.\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, he didn't throw up on the baby. That's a win.</p>", "3036": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How can she hate me? I make her food in my chest! It's like hating a frozen yogurt machine.</p>", "3037": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It says here that up to 80% of new mothers experience baby blues. And that the best thing to do is reassure them that they're doing a good job. Bernadette, you are doing a good job.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Thank you, Sheldon, I'm feeling better now.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you, Internet. I'm telling you, with the right YouTube video, I can give Howard a vasectomy.</p>", "3038": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Thank you, God, for the food we are about to receive and for the nourishment of our bodies and bless the hands that prepared it. Amen.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Given that your hands prepared it, isn't that a little self-serving?<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> You start changing the words to the prayers, next thing you know, you're in a church with a guitar.</p>", "3039": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Shelly, how do I put this? By your third birthday, you had memorized over a thousand different kinds of trains, and I never imagined a woman getting aboard any of them.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What, so - You thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life?<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> No! Just for the middle part. 'Cause at the end I assumed there'd be nurses.</p>", "3040": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, this is highly insulting.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, don't overreact.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm the child she was worried about? I have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn't power a potato clock ... if I spotted them the potato.</p>", "3041": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> He's been in there a long time. Should I go talk to him?<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> He's upset with me. I should be the one who talks to him. (stays seated and works on her knitting)<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you going to?<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh, heck no.</p>", "3042": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> She said not to come. It's gonna be a while.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (sighs) Well, first deliveries can be slow.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am starting to rethink the Flash onesie I bought this kid.</p>", "3043": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I guess I guess we should stop.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I'm afraid so. Childbirth, looming coitus? This is a banner night for female genitals.</p>", "3044": "<p><strong>Althea:</strong> Okay, Dad, how far apart are the contractions?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No idea. Ask him.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> 12 minutes.<br/><strong>Althea:</strong> 12 minutes? Why are you here?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Aren't we supposed to get here an hour and a half early?<br/><strong>Althea:</strong> This is a hospital, not the airport.</p>", "3045": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Stuart, stop driving like an old man. Speed it up a little.<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'm not an old man! I just can't see at night.</br></p>", "3046": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Howard and Bernadette's kid might be born on your birthday. How cool is that?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yeah, but I thought this baby was supposed to ruin their sex life, not mine.</p>", "3047": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not just Howard and Bernadette. I mean, look how far we've all come.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hmm.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> You two got married.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon and I are living together.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But if my mom asks, we have bunk beds.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny was a struggling actress when we met, and now she's a successful pharmaceutical rep.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, you don't have to say \"struggling\" every time. You can just say actress.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Howard went to space.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Bernadette got her doctorate.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, Howard and I are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> We've all come a long way. There's a lot to be proud of.</p>", "3048": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sorry, Stuart.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hey, I'm in a hospital and I'm not the patient. I'm fine.</p>", "3049": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Does the baby have a name yet?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We have named her Halley.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, like Halley's comet.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Exactly. Also like the comet, Bernadette said she's not gonna have sex with me for another 75 years.</p>", "3050": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy third wheel way before you came along.</p>", "3051": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Look, we can't just throw away Penny's stuff, but we can ask if she wants any of it back.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, I wonder how she feels about all this artwork.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I'm sure she misses this one. I mean, it's the greatest gift I've ever given anybody.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It may have appreciated in value. The artist killed himself shortly after painting that.</p>", "3052": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know what? There is one thing I would like.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, take whatever you want.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I would like to keep the official flag of our apartment.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But you don't even like flags.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, I like this one.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I designed it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But you made me order it because you were \"too well-known\" in the flag community and they'd jack up the price.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But you don't even understand its symbolism.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I do. The-the field of blue represents you being miserable, and the lion sticking its tongue out means I'm happy about it.</p>", "3053": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hello?<br/><strong>Theodore:</strong> Hey, how you doing?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, can I help you?<br/><strong>Theodore:</strong> I don't think so, but you're sweet for asking.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What-What are you doing in our apartment?<br/><strong>Theodore:</strong> Oh, I rented a room from your neighbor, the tall guy dressed like a little boy.</p>", "3054": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, tomorrow who wants to paint the nursery?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'll do it.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Why do you get to do it? I'm the artist.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Just because you're starving doesn't make you an artist.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Just because I look sickly doesn't mean I'm starving.</p>", "3055": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I admire you, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really, why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're happy with who you are. You don't get jealous of other people. Instead of being weighed down by ambition, you just float along like a dead body in a river.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I couldn't just take the compliment. I had to ask why.</p>", "3056": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am not proud of this. But I have been envious of your recent success.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant, everyone's jealous of me. Once I get LASIK, I'll be out of things to wish for.</p>", "3057": "<p><strong>Stephen Hawking:</strong> Hello, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Professor Hawking!<br/><strong>Stephen Hawking:</strong> I understand you're struggling with professional jealousy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thanks, Leonard, now he's not gonna think I'm cool.<br/><strong>Stephen Hawking:</strong> Don't worry, I know how you feel. I have never won a Nobel Prize.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, wow, that doesn't seem fair.<br/><strong>Stephen Hawking:</strong> It's fine. I've been on The Simpsons.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?<br/><strong>Stephen Hawking:</strong> I remind myself every scientific advancement is a victory. Also, I was on Star Trek.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (To Penny) Oh, it was a good one. He played poker with Sir Isaac - You don't care.<br/><strong>Stephen Hawking:</strong> Don't waste your time on jealousy, Sheldon, you're too brilliant.</p>", "3058": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I have to say, it is nice to share this experience with someone who's on the same journey. Although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Are you actually comparing my human baby to your brain in a bowl?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I didn't make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You do realize my baby has functioning organs and can recognize voices.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Mine has a fully developed immune system.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ours doesn't need an immune system because it lives in a state-of-the-art German incubator.</p>", "3059": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, that's enough.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, yeah, no, fine. Let's just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them. Although, we didn't need to have sex with Howard for ours, so we win.</p>", "3060": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Could you two really have some sort of super-intelligent child?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, there is a genetic component, but that doesn't guarantee anything.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's true. Sheldon's father once picked a fight with a cactus.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, but that's just his Earth parents. We don't know anything about the ones that sent him here.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, we know they were smart enough to send him away.</br></p>", "3061": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And you realize what the next step is?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Set up a second culture and try to replicate our results.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, no. We lock that door, lower our underpants a little, and make a baby.</p>", "3062": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> How come you never eat broccoli?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm married, I don't have to be attractive.</p>", "3063": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How much will it hurt?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's just a tiny skin sample. You saw me do it to myself.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> On a scale of one to ten, where one is a pebble in your shoe and ten is the monkey you thought was your pet biting your face off.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> A two.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Eating a whole Altoid?</p>", "3064": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, in the spirit of cohabitation, the theme of today's episode is flags of two regions coming together as one.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Such as the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, let's roll up our \"sleevis\" and get to know Nevis.<br/>\n*Howard plays a rimshot sound*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I-I like that, but next time check with me.</p>", "3065": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What's going on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Can it be more of an internal struggle?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have to see it. While I'm gone, don't breathe on my pillow.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> How about if I just don't breathe at all?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's my girl.</p>", "3066": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> If we're all gonna die, why am I eating so much kale?</p>", "3067": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why would she keep something from me, you know? I shared my body with that woman. And my Netflix password. They recommended \"Stella Got Her Groove Back\" because of her.</p>", "3068": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Everybody wants to spend more time with me. I'm like a man made of sugar in a world of ants.</p>", "3069": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Buddy, buddy, listen, nothing bad is going on, she just she just didn't want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't understand.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She's enjoying living with you and she didn't want it to end early.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, she's deceiving me in order to spend more time with me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Well, I feel both flattered and hurt. Like when people say I look like that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh my God, that's who you look like.</p>", "3070": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So until Amy's apartment is fixed, she and I are living here together.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> I lived with my old girlfriend. She was a geologist, too.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Things didn't work out?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> I came home from work one day and she had taken everything. I'm warning you, hide your good rocks.</p>", "3071": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, have you ever heard of the Van Nuys Comic-Con?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, it's a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I got asked to sign autographs there.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's awesome! Is this for Serial Ape-ist?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, it could be for the monkey movie. It could be my hemorrhoid commercial. The list does not go on.</p>", "3072": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> There's nothing to be afraid of, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The average cork speed is 25 miles per hour. If that is too fast around a school, it is certainly too fast around a kitchen.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Been 15 minutes. Just sayin'.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, I can do this. Just give me a moment. (Cork pops and Sheldon shrieks) Oh! Mimosas coming up.</p>", "3073": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Uh, I left my phone downstairs!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Damn, so did I.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Wait, I have my iPad.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What are you going to do, e-mail 911?</p>", "3074": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, let's just get them apart for a while so they can cool down.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Good. Then before we reintroduce them, we'll give him one of her sweaters so he can get used to her scent again.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So it's okay for you to joke around?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, that's actually what we did with him when Howard came back from space.</p>", "3075": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm in this relationship, too. I need to stand up for myself.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Of course you do.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And if he doesn't like it, he can move back here.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, he can try. He'd just need a good locksmith.</br></p>", "3076": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you. Given the five-week end-date, isn't it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't try luring me in with sexy talk.</p>", "3077": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No matter where I am, this will always be my spot.</p>", "3078": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You can stay in Leonard's room, and we'll stay at my place.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You're sure that's not an inconvenience?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, not at all.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And we live with Sheldon, so the word \"inconvenience\" has really lost all meaning.</p>", "3079": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Do they know why the pipes burst?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> They didn't say.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water.<br/>\nCan't have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did and not pick up a few things about plumbing.</p>", "3080": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Comfy?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I'm just happy I don't know what this memory foam remembers.</p>", "3081": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> It's pretty late. You think I've got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure, I'm still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, while you do that I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the day's thoughts.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's called sleep and it's my bedtime. Nighty-night, y'all.</p>", "3082": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't even know where to begin.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, in The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews says, \"Let's start at the very beginning. A very good place to start.\"<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, I was gonna start at the end. Thank God you're here.</p>", "3083": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Not every girl dreams about being a mom. Sometimes you think you're never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and you're pregnant. And it doesn't matter that your career's going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog!</p>", "3084": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> It makes sense you two are friends. I mean, hot girls always stick together.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And you thought this wasn't gonna be a great party.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, I had no idea Caltech is exactly like my high school.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, it's not exactly like it. We're all extremely smart.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow. You popular girls are mean.</p>", "3085": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Okay, well, thanks for coming by. You're nice people.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, so are you. In fact, you know what? We will never take you for granite. Did you get that? Granite? A little geology joke.</p>", "3086": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> But I thought I'd be more excited.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Oh, being excited isn't a guarantee of anything. Rajesh's mother was thrilled when she was pregnant with him. After he was born, she doted on his every move. And you know what happened? He broke her heart, moved halfway around the world, and dates only poor white women. So you never know.</p>", "3087": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sir, we've hit a bit of a snag. We're already behind schedule.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I understand that we're under contract, and I don't know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh we're not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised.<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> (gets up and sighs) How long do you need?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We're thinking two years.<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> All right.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (chuckles) That's it? You're okay with that?<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> (scoffs) You think you're the first government contractor who isn't gonna deliver on time? We're still waiting for a big space laser Reagan ordered to beat the commies.</p>", "3088": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I was counting on that money. I need to make as much as my wife so I don't have to try so hard in bed.</p>", "3089": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Are you kidding? I've always been treated differently! Look at me. Listen to me. I mean, the first thought when you see me isn't, \"That's a scientist.\" It's, \"I wonder if her mommy knows where she is.\"</p>", "3090": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, this military guy showed up at Howard's door. He was terrifying.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh no, what did he say?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That doesn't sound terrifying.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Not to a white guy born here, no. To a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it - terrifying.</br></p>", "3091": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm worried about Howard. Ever since that guy from the Air Force showed up, he's been a nervous wreck.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We work at a giant pharmaceutical company. Get him some anti-anxiety meds.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> He won't take any pills that aren't chewable and shaped like a Flintstone.</p>", "3092": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We don't need Howard's cousin, no. We have me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're not a lawyer, Sheldon, you're just a know-it-all.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am not a know-it-all. I'm a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they're wrong.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's the definition of being a know-it-all.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Or in German, a Besserwisser.</p>", "3093": "<p><strong>Marty:</strong> Howard, why is he yelling at me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, you were on Jeopardy. Allow me to Alex Trebek this and put it in the form of a question: Who has been a complete waste of our time?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Marty, let me call you back.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Someday, when I'm up on murder charges, you'll be hearing from me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You don't need him. I'll represent you.</p>", "3094": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't understand why I can't talk at this meeting.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> 'Cause when you talk, it enrages people.</p>", "3095": "<p><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> So, which one of you is the brains behind all this?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's a group effort, but I guess if we had to pick a main brain, it would be me.<br/>\n(Sheldon whimpers)</p>", "3096": "<p><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> And because of the quantum vortices, this can run perpetually?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Exactly. Yeah, you have a good grasp of the physics.<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Well, I'm a scientist by training.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really? You're a physicist?<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Better. I'm an engineer.<br/>\n(Sheldon stops himself from speaking)</p>", "3097": "<p><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> I'll cut to the chase. The Air Force believes there's an application for this technology, and we're interested in funding your research.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, thanks, but you should know we're a little concerned about this being used in weapons.<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Oh, well, let me put your mind at ease. What we use it for is none of your business.</p>", "3098": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm not even sure that's possible.<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Well, I ran it by some colleagues at MIT, and they thought they could get it done in four months.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Four months?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, we'll do it in two! (laughs) Hi, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I'm the actual brains behind this project. Also, engineers aren't real scientists, MIT's a trade school, and the Death Star is from Star Wars, not Star Trek! But otherwise, thank you for your service.</p>", "3099": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Do you know what? It's just a research project. The most important job in the world is gonna be raising this child. It's all I need to give my life meaning.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's so beautiful.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You believe me? Oh, good. Eleven more chumps like you, I'll have the jury eating out of my hand.</p>", "3100": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, I would not have done that for you.</p>", "3101": "<p><strong>Randall:</strong> You know, It's hard to believe I've never met Leonard.<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs from a local vendor.<br/><strong>Susan:</strong> Not funny, Wyatt.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I thought it was really funny.<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Thanks.</p>", "3102": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you think your father's doing unspeakable things to my mother?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Your parents are old. Anything unspeakable was finished by 9:30.</p>", "3103": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, did you defile my mother or not?</p>", "3104": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I don't see why I should have to watch your father parade around with some Bible-thumping bumpkin.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Excuse me, that is my mother you're talking about, however accurately.</p>", "3105": "<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Very nice, Wyatt. And you wonder why this one turned out the way he did.<br><strong>Randall:</strong> You see what I've gotta put up with.<br/><strong>Susan:</strong> What you've gotta put up with? Why did you have to go to jail?<br/><strong>Randall:</strong> It's called getting caught, Mother!</br></p>", "3106": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did that conversation include the phrase \"your genitals are a joy to behold\"?<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> Look, I promise you, neither I, nor anyone, has ever said that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You don't know his girlfriend very well.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.</p>", "3107": "<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Penny, I don't know what I was worried about. Your friends are just lovely.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, thanks, Mom.<br/><strong>Susan:</strong> Although that Sheldon is a bit peculiar.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Is he? I never noticed.<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> He reminds me of that turkey we had who drowned looking up at the rain.</p>", "3108": "<p><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Welcome to the family, Leonard. Don't lend your new brother-in-law money.</p>", "3109": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Love is patient, but it's not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so let's knock it off!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> At least she's yelling at someone else for a change.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howard!</p>", "3110": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, I understand everyone's a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff. Leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. But also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for marrying me. Hopefully for the last time.</p>", "3111": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. But I don't think I'll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. You know maybe I don't need to understand it, I just need to be grateful. I love you, Penny.</p>", "3112": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hi, how was the screening?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad, but only the white people felt bad.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ugh, I should've never bought him that colouring book that explains Black History Month.</p>", "3113": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How'd it go with my mother?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but I think we got to a good place.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wow. Well done.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did she think you were choking or ...?</p>", "3114": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Um, so listen, I don't know if you have any plans next weekend, but I kind of promised your mom we'd have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait, we're gonna get married again?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.</p>", "3115": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, then it's settled. Yay. So funny. I never thought my second marriage would be to you.</p>", "3116": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother. She is coming to the wedding.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, wait, you're inviting people to our wedding?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, I'm inviting people to our wedding. Yeah, I've already asked Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr, and, now don't get your hopes up, 'cause he's pretty busy, but Erno Rubik.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Who's Erno Rubik?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Seriously? He invented the Rubik's Cube.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, fine, but why would you invite him to our wedding?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man.</p>", "3117": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> How dare you invite your father without consulting me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sorry, but I don't think I need your permission to have my father at my wedding.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> You do understand our marriage ended because he had an affair.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know, and there's no excuse for that.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> He claimed I was cold, emasculating, and hadn't shown him any physical affection for years.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I was wrong, there's three excuses for that.</p>", "3118": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, I just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Open it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hmm. \"We request a meeting at your earliest convenience regarding your quantum guidance system, provisional patent 62/295118.\" That's weird.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Is there a window around here we don't know about?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm sure it's just a coincidence.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, of course. What else could it be? (loudly) Boy, do I love America!</p>", "3119": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Thank you for picking me up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, you're welcome.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> I was speaking to your young lady.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh, please call me Mary.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, Mary.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, that doesn't work for me, let's stay with Mrs. Cooper.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Sheldon, don't be silly.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wh-, what? That's what I called you 'til I got to know you better.</p>", "3120": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm sorry, you find this funny?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> No, I was just thinking about Jurassic World. Boy, that was terrible.</br></p>", "3121": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, we have to use the stairs.<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> When are they gonna fix your elevator?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, I don't- Any day now.<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> Well, the stairs are fine. Besides, your mother is up there. Maybe I'll have a heart attack and not have to see her.</p>", "3122": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> And, of course, Mom.<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> Hello, my hateful shrew.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, now I'm starting to sense a little tension.</p>", "3123": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, you two, don't start. Penny and I are throwing this second wedding for your benefit. Can you please not ruin it?<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> Of course. I'm sorry.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oh, look at that, you can apologize.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mom.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I'm sorry.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> You know, the Bible says forgiveness-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mom.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> I'm sorry.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, who's hungry? We have a reservation at the best restaurant in town.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not sorry. That's true.</p>", "3124": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Penny, I hope the example of my failed marriage to Leonard's father doesn't discourage you from the commitment you've made to one another.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, of course not.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Although Alfred and I had a lot more going for us than you two.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mom, please save something for the toast.</p>", "3125": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> So, Alfred, what is it that you do for a living?<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> Oh, I'm an anthropologist. I study ancient peoples and cultures.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> My goodness, so all the way back to the Flood.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't laugh, she wasn't joking.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Play with your phone.</p>", "3126": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You really want me to pick up your mother all by myself?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hmm, I just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Or a way for you to avoid her?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know what he's putting on those cards, but you are smarter than ever.</p>", "3127": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Did you guys see there's an Avengers screening? Joss Whedon's gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, well, I have a few questions for him about the last Avengers movie, and a whole lot of answers.</p>", "3128": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> If you really care that much, there are apps now that'll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> People are actually waiting in lines as a job? Boy, makes me feel better about my life.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Some of these guys make over $20 an hour.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> And now I feel worse again.</p>", "3129": "<p><strong>Beverly:</strong> I'm not surprised Leonard chose to avoid picking me up. He's battled intimacy issues his whole life. Does he have difficulty maintaining erections?</p>", "3130": "<p><strong>Beverly:</strong> Penny, it's only natural to want your mother-in-law to like you, and I acknowledge I can be an intimidating person. So what can I do to make this process easier for you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> And how does it make you feel when I psychoanalyze everything you say?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uncomfortable.<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> That was a joke, dear.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. Sorry. Didn't know you made those.</p>", "3131": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, listen, what if we have a little mother-in-law, daughter-in-law dinner tonight?<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> So just the two of us?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Or I invite a few girlfriends, 'cause hearing you say the two of us just sent a chill right down my spine.</p>", "3132": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hold on. He paid you to get out of spending time with me?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> No, it's not like that. There's a long line he'd rather stand in. So what are we doing? Old Navy, Build-A-Bear? I get paid either way.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> We're not going shopping together.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> You sure? I'm happy to hold your bag. And Sheldon gave me money for a hotdog on a stick.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Can you understand why I might be annoyed right now?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Look, lady, I just work here.</p>", "3133": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Stuart, what are you doing here?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Sheldon, you are the most inconsiderate person I have ever met in my entire life. Where do you get off sending me to shop with your girlfriend?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't understand. You were happy to do this when I hired you. Why are you upset with me now?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, I'm not upset with you. But Amy's pretty bent out of shape, so she hired me to let you have it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> You're darn right it's fair play, you selfish jerk.</p>", "3134": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, she's my mother-in-law. Why can't I bond with her like that?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Amy's with Sheldon, who she loves like a son. You're with her son, who she doesn't.</p>", "3135": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Boy, all this standing's making me tired. Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Not the stick chair. You look like an idiot on that thing.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy.</br></p>", "3136": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You look like you come with a kickstand.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You can't make me feel bad.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hmm, maybe not. Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?</p>", "3137": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did you see that? He just cut the line.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He's just joining his friends; it's fine.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, it's not fine. It is a breach of line etiquette.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We're near the front of the line. We'll get in either way.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What if every person in front of us let someone cut?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We'd still get in.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What if each of those people let someone cut?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Still get in.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But then each of those people let someone cut?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We'd still get in, but first I'd hit you over the head with his stick chair.</p>", "3138": "<p><strong>Guy:</strong> Is this guy for real?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Boy, I wish I could say no.</p>", "3139": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me, excuse me, can I please see a show of hands? Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?<br/><strong>Guy:</strong> Told you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, what a sad state of affairs. That you've all been so ground down by life, you don't even notice when someone disrespects you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I can't believe we're gonna get beat up, and it's not because of your chair.</p>", "3140": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, dude, you're killing me with Claire.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> What are you talking about?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I mean, come on, look at you. You're classically handsome, you've got a swimmer's body. Next to you, I look like me.</p>", "3141": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, okay, just do me a favor and stop talking about how great Claire is.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Anything for you, my little foreign friend.</p>", "3142": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> I see what you're saying. She's not so great.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Don't listen to him. He says crazy things all the time. Uh, watch. Marco.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Polo.</p>", "3143": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, uh, what are you guys talking about?<br/><strong>Claire:</strong> Your friends were just telling me about all the other girls you're dating.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We didn't.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You just did.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Wow. Maybe none of you guys are smart.</p>", "3144": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Does it bother you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, it did at first. But then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia, and they really helped put things into perspective.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Who are these people?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, friends are like toilet paper. It's good to have extras under the sink.</p>", "3145": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, well, let me know if you guys want to go.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I would love to. I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.</p>", "3146": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wine again? Yeah, no, thank you. I like my grapes the old-fashioned way, in a juice box.</p>", "3147": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, it makes perfect sense. Because you're an expectant mother, you can't drink alcohol. I don't like to. You can't have sushi. I don't like to. You can't go in hot tubs. I consider them vats of sweaty people soup.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Gee, Sheldon, I dont know.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, come on. Roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs, I've been avoiding these things all my life. And now, because you're pregnant, you have to.</p>", "3148": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> The difference is she's bringing life into the world, and you suck it out.</p>", "3149": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So what do you want to do tonight?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I have quite the evening planned. Our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains, and then we'll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> There's more than one?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You've heard of French toast?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (upbeat) Yeah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Cinnamon toast?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (upbeat) Yeah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Melba toast?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (upbeat) Yeah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You get where I'm going here?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (downbeat) Yeah.</p>", "3150": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> So how's the science world? What are you guys up to?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> We've actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But we won't bore you with the details.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Are you kidding? I love science. Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Mike deGrasse Tyson.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Mike deGrasse Tyson?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a mustache and became a scientist.</br></p>", "3151": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> So what's your invention?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, we're using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Angular momentum. I was wondering about that.</p>", "3152": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What is it about trains that you like so much?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What an interesting question. When I was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order. I could line them up, categorize them, control them. I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn't.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's lovely, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, other than when they're chugging through your bowels, these things are magic.</p>", "3153": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Your name is Bernatrix. You are a warrior queen. You're strong, beautiful and tall.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh. I like the idea of being tall.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think you're gonna like a lot of things I have in store. For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> This is getting fun. What's next?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're parched and weary from battle. You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest, most delicious ale in all the realm.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, I haven't had a drink in months.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What do you do?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He wants to see I.D.</p>", "3154": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Zack, this is my friend Claire.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> You're hot. You seeing anybody?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, she's seeing me.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Why'd you say she's your friend?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> We're just keeping it casual.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Why is he being casual with you? You seem great.<br/><strong>Claire:</strong> I don't know. Ask him.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Why are you being casual with her? She seems great.</p>", "3155": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, let me stop you right there. We absolutely know our invention will not be used to destroy the world.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Because no one from the future has come back to kill us.</p>", "3156": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have a question about Batman. Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be Man-Batman?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, he'd be Bat-Man-Bat.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> But wouldn't Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But Batman is a man. You're talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. That's just Man-Man.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, isn't Man-Man just Man?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, that's just Batman.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, if a man dresses as a bat, that's Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, that's Batman-Man.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So does that answer your question?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I haven't asked it yet.</p>", "3157": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? The guy who for years couldn't even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them? How is that possible?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I know. Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Seriously, that guy's dating two women?</p>", "3158": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm not sure if I'm hoping for a boy or a girl. I mean, if it's a boy, I'm gonna have to teach him to play catch. Which means I'm gonna have to Google how to play catch.</p>", "3159": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> There you go again.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Actually, what you're doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How could you say that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (imitating Raj) Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I never said that.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (imitating Raj) Don't you hate it when you can't remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, that I said. But that's a real problem. You give a girl another woman's bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl, but not her.</p>", "3160": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I was told this is where to go if I'm mad at Howard.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> May I take your cloak?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Thanks. This thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike.</p>", "3161": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> So what happened with you and Howard?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily, and I accused him of being jealous.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'm jealous. Closest I've come to dating two women was that time I dated one woman.</p>", "3162": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> All right, it's almost game time. Get it? Game of Thrones, game time?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Two women, huh?</p>", "3163": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What about your weird relationship with him?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's different. I'm like the little girl in Poltergeist and he's the creepy thing in the TV.</p>", "3164": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why are you dressed like that?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, uh, Howard thought it'd be funny to tell me it was a costume party.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That wasn't nice.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> No, but he almost died, so we're cool.</p>", "3165": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You all right?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm fine. Just a little embarrassed I had to be carried down the stairs like a baby. (To Penny) Thanks.</br></p>", "3166": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'll see if it's available.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, if that study's real, Leonard might come back smarter than you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you trying to manipulate me?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well done, it worked, we're going.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yay!</p>", "3167": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I didn't know you needed help running errands today.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I didn't, but Raj volunteered.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant, he's really been making a fuss over me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. Well, I guess that's kind of sweet.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Bernie, I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite, but I'd love to hear what you think.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And it just got weird.</p>", "3168": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> He's just trying to be supportive.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Just supportive. Not over-the-top in any way?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hello. (Raj walks in with a gigantic teddy bear)<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You saw him carrying that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Astronauts saw him carrying that.</p>", "3169": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Of course. I'll give you guys some space. Let me just get this out of your way. (Raj fumbles around trying to move the gigantic teddy bear. He knocks over various objects in Howard &amp; Bernadette's living room)<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You need some help?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, I got it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Raj, Raj, wait.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Please, Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity. (Raj falls over the teddy bear as he tries to move it out the door)</p>", "3170": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, what did you do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I'm not proud of it, but I jaywalked.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, no, it's like a horror movie. We're trapped in a cabin with a maniac!</p>", "3171": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (Hearing their baby's heartbeat) Wait, that's it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wow.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Isn't that the best?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You guys made a person.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We did.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And I like to think I helped.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You didn't.</p>", "3172": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, why don't you get a new computer? You know that one's out-of-date.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, but I like this computer.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, I didn't get that.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, one more time. The sound is cutting out. (Amy holds up a sign) I can't read that. The video is failing.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Get a new computer.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Get a new computer.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What? (Answering phone) Hello?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Get a new computer!</p>", "3173": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> This is cool. When was the last time you and I built something together?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Scientifically? A little over a year ago. LEGOs? Last week in my room.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If there was a Nobel Prize for Millennium Falcons that fall apart when you pick them up, we'd be set.</p>", "3174": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, the guy at the store said this one is great.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Oh, the guy. Oh, pardon me. I didn't realize you'd spoken to the guy. Yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah? Oh, well, was this guy Rick from Computer Solutions on Colorado?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, well, he does know his stuff.</p>", "3175": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I suppose I should set this up. Or would you like to rob me of that, too?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Knock it off or I'll start making W-H sounds for words that just have a W.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You wouldn't.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Whatch me.</p>", "3176": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, just tell me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It might be easier to show you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We'd have to take your car.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> All right.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And I'm gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I signed one before we slept together. Why not now?</p>", "3177": "<p>Cinema Worker: Hey, guys, thank you for being a part of our test screening. You're about to be one of the first audiences to see Suicide Squad.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, you were right.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, I keep telling you, good things happen to bad people.</p>", "3178": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh. You know what? I'm gonna let them know that I'm here with you and that they're busted.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No. You know what? Don't, don't. Let's let them think they're getting away with it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, let's see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mmm-hmm.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Interesting. I mean, it's not testicles on a cryostat, but I like it.</p>", "3179": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay. Okay, how about this? They don't know you're here with us, so you hide in the closet. When they show up, we'll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were, we'll pretend to believe them and just when they think they got away with it, you jump out.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, that's pretty good.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I love it, I'll be all like, \"Busted!\", and they'll be like, \"What?\", and then we'll all be like, \"Oh, yeah!\" Yeah, I get it. I wouldn't make out with me, either.</p>", "3180": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, no one else knows about this?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Only you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Thank you for trusting me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What good is having a girlfriend if you can't unload your psychological sewage on her?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's me, your emotional outhouse.</br></p>", "3181": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You look amazing. I mean, this resolution is remarkable.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (On Skype) I really had to go home for this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, but it's like you're right here in the room.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And yet, I'm not.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I feel like I could reach out and touch you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And yet, you can't.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know.</p>", "3182": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> See, he's not wearing a tie.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, he's a patent attorney. Maybe his tie is pending.</p>", "3183": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hold on, hold on. So the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%? Patent Attorney: Dr. Hofstadter, this university has been paying your salaries for over ten years. Did you think we do that out of the goodness of our hearts?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, until you just said that mean thing, kinda.</p>", "3184": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> That was rough, you guys.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know, but you did it. I'm so proud of you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, anyway, I'll leave you to your girls' night.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you sure you don't want to stay here with us?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, I kind of feel like being alone right now.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, if you change your mind, we'll be here.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Say hi to Emily for us.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Will do!</p>", "3185": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Guys, everyone is involved in this, okay? Howard's invention, Sheldon's math, my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid. Which I'm sure Penny would've mentioned if she wasn't working on that hangnail right now.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What?</p>", "3186": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> They've been out there a while.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I hope everything's okay.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I wonder what they're talking about.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (eavesdropping at the door) If you guys would shut up, I could tell you.</p>", "3187": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hang on. Maybe there should be a \"no insult\" clause about me, too.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you still like cilantro?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're tying my hands here.</p>", "3188": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't think I can go back out there.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's fine. You know, I hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. But what I hate even more is, if I was there, I would have tortured you, too.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Based on this pep talk, I'd say you're still doing it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> My point is, there was a time I never would've been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favorite people. So, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, I'm happy to do it with you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, everyone will think I'm weird.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sweetie, you are weird. Everyone knows you're weird, but they're all still here because they care about you so much.</p>", "3189": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> (Knocking) Hello! Some of us need to check our hair because we might have a shot with Leonard's mother.</p>", "3190": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, everybody, Sheldon is gonna come back out, but I think he's a little embarrassed, so let's all be extra nice, okay?<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> What are you looking at me for? I'm a saint. (chuckles) But a sinner in the sack.</p>", "3191": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> If I may, I'd like to propose a toast. Um, thank you all for coming tonight. I know it's customary for the birthday boy to receive presents, but I feel like I got the greatest gift the day he was born.<br/>\nEverybody: Aww.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hear, hear.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, that was lovely. You know, this is fun. Let's do more. Someone else say something wonderful about me.</p>", "3192": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wil Wheaton, go.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Sheldon, I know that we've had our ups and downs, but I can honestly say that my life is so much more interesting because you are in it. We may have met because you are a fan of Star Trek. But I have become a fan of Sheldon Cooper. Live long and prosper, buddy. And happy birthday.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's how you do it, Wolowitz. Now you see why he's famous and you're not.</p>", "3193": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Sheldon, I know the future holds great things for you, and we all can't wait to see what they are. Happy birthday, dear.</p>", "3194": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Someone call Animal Control. There's a cougar on the loose.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Barry, stop.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Seriously, Barry, stop.</p>", "3195": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So Sheldon, there's something I've been wanting to talk about but I know it's kind of a touchy subject.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Way to narrow it down to everything.</br></p>", "3196": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait a minute. You mention his birthday and he vanishes?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, where's that information been this whole time?</p>", "3197": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, what is the problem? Is it about getting older?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Please! Look at this porcelain skin. I'm like a human sink.</p>", "3198": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You mean, some guy in a lame suit?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Or a real Batman. Hey, Stuart? Didn't you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Yeah, but there was kind of a scheduling conflict. He, uh, wanted to know when he'd get paid. And I wouldn't tell him.</p>", "3199": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can I get his contact info?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Sure, uh, but just so you know, he's kind of a diva.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He is?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, yeah. Won't take the bus. He won't pack his own lunch. Won't let you spend the night on his couch.</p>", "3200": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, so what was Adam West like on the phone?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, nice guy. But it was a little weird to hear Batman say, \"Don't ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy.\"</p>", "3201": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, I was just glad to be invited. To be honest, I don't always feel like I'm part of the group.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, sweetie, we're on the clock here. Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?</p>", "3202": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, Mother, I'm surprised you came all this way for Sheldon's birthday.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oh, I was happy to. He did come to my 60th.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, you had a party for your 60th?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oh, I wouldn't call it a party. Just a few close friends. And your sister and brother.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas and didn't invite her.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> And I never did thank you for that, dear.</p>", "3203": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, Raj, I read a couple guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I heard about that. Why didn't you discover it?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Because instead of being in the telescope room, I was busy making you guys homemade jam for the holidays.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry</p>", "3204": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Buddy, I think you might be overreacting.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And then there's this nose. I mean, what if he looks like me? Or worse what if she looks like me?</p>", "3205": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not to mention the impact on our social circle. Everything's going to change. Howard won't be able to come over as much.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, he could bring the baby here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, but then we'd have to baby-proof the apartment. You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom. I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.</p>", "3206": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> A million dollars? God, it's like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts.</p>", "3207": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> That's it. I got to start earning more money right now.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I know, you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> This isn't a joke.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I wasn't joking.</p>", "3208": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, let's go do something to get your mind off this.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, yeah, we should go out.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Where?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, I don't know, a bar?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Can't drink.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We can, but all right.</p>", "3209": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'd like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard. His, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.</p>", "3210": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> If I'm gonna have any chance of raising this kid, I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> There's no reason you can't.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's easy for you to say. You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's just research. We're never gonna make any money from it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Forget helium. The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug. It reminds me of my daddy's secret \"Don't Tell Mama\" juice.</br></p>", "3211": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, how about this for an invention: slightly bigger cocktail umbrellas?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How is that a new invention?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. All Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.</p>", "3212": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's some smart talk from a guy who can't even keep his face in focus.</p>", "3213": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, yeah. You get to buy toys and little clothes.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I kind of already do that for Howie.</p>", "3214": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, you gonna get up there later?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? You bet I am.</p>", "3215": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'd like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my wife, best friend, and now the mother of our child. I love you, Bernie.<br/>\n\"Havin' my baby / What a lovely way of sayin' / How much you love me / Havin' my baby / What a lovely way of sayin' / What you're thinkin' of me\"</p>", "3216": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If any of you are looking for something to do on Valentine's Day, Amy and I'll be streaming our first-ever live episode of Fun With Flags. You're welcome to join us as we celebrate the timeless love affair between wind and flapping fabric.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny and I have dinner reservations that night, but any other time, no.</p>", "3217": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You've been talking about breaking up with Emily forever. Why don't you just do it already?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, just get it over with.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, you say it like it's easy. Have any one of you ever broken up with anyone?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not really.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, uh, once I ordered an Uber by accident. I just got in and went somewhere.</p>", "3218": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, my advice to you is do it at her place so you can leave when you need to. Uh, tell the truth, make it quick and be prepared for tears.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, I'm gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there. Really dry myself out.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She meant Emily.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, I - I really didn't.</p>", "3219": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm gonna check the temp on the tub.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Don't make it too hot.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sorry, but \"too hot\" is the only temperature I come in.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Look at that. You shaved it all.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're welcome.</p>", "3220": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's not moving, but I think it's still alive.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?</p>", "3221": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Should we name him?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It is Valentine's Day. How about Valentino?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Nice. A classic rabbit name. Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit. Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit.<br/>\nOh, look at all that chest hair and overbite. Of course you're a Wolowitz.</p>", "3222": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Son of a bitch! He bit me!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Are you okay?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, I'm not okay! Wild rabbits can have rabies!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh. Well, why did you put your finger near its mouth?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Poor judgment, obviously.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> He's so little. I'm sure it's fine.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> How can it be fine? I just got attacked by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.</p>", "3223": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so ... you think you got problems.</p>", "3224": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> He's not showing any symptoms. I guess I'll just go to the emergency room to be safe.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie, this is just your hypochondria.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, when I sat on the mute button and thought I'd gone deaf, that was my hypochondria.</p>", "3225": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right. Nothing about this is fun. No one wants to talk about flags, and I haven't spoken in over ten minutes, so, enjoy your new show, Internet. \"Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler Present ... With\".</p>", "3226": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Raj, now, I'm sorry you're suffering. When Amy and I were broken up, I also suffered. And this may sound surprising, but I'm grateful for having gone through it.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. I believe our relationship now is stronger than ever.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So do I.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When we were apart, I learned how important you are to me. And I realize that when two people are in love, sometimes they-</br></p>", "3227": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did you know the singular of confetti is \"confetto\"?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Interesting, and when would you use the singular?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm glad you asked. Amy, you have a confetto in your nose. No, no, no, no. Other side. There you go.</p>", "3228": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's not her. That's not her. That's not her. That's not her.<br/>\nThat's not her. That's not her. That's not her. That's not her.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And that's not helpful.</p>", "3229": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, I got her an iPhone for Christmas. I'll see where she is.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, that's nice. Most people her age don't embrace technology.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no, she doesn't even know she has it. No, I had my sister slip it in her bag so that I can track her like a sea turtle.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Same as when we lost you at the zoo.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, for the hundredth time, I smelled kettle corn and couldn't find the cart.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Still doesn't explain how you ended up on the freeway divider.<br/></p>", "3230": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Here we are talking about Frozen, and yet, you got burned.</p>", "3231": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you comfortable?<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Very. It's nice to rest after 800 flights of stairs.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You were so cute, huffin' and puffin'.</p>", "3232": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A Texas Special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell! Thank you, Meemaw!<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Oh, you're welcome, Moonpie.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, why don't you look excited? You get to watch me play with this!</p>", "3233": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I've seen you here before, Claire.<br/><strong>Claire:</strong> It's my first time. I'm looking for inspiration for this movie I'm writing.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're a screenwriter?<br/><strong>Claire:</strong> Well, screenwriter / bartender / a month away from living in my car.</p>", "3234": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, I get that. I'm a scientist / party planner / small-dog enthusiast / guy who probably should have stopped at scientist.</p>", "3235": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What are you doing? You have a girlfriend.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So, how do you think she'd feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I wouldn't say she's beautiful.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really? You don't think she's attractive?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I do. I just wouldn't tell my girlfriend.</p>", "3236": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Constance, are you sure I can't pour you some wine?<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Oh, no wine for me. Sheldon's bringing me my whiskey.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Here you go, Meemaw. I made it just how you like - a lot in a glass.</p>", "3237": "<p><strong>Meemaw:</strong> So, Penny, I understand you have a new job.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes, I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Oh. It's so wonderful that you modern gals can have it all. A husband and a full-time career.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I have a relationship and a full-time career, too.<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> That doesn't bode well.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why not? You just said it's okay for her to work.<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Well, Leonard doesn't need as much tending to as Sheldon does. And as Moonpie explained, Leonard's work is more of a hobby.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's my best friend.</p>", "3238": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Look, I get that you're protective of your grandson, but he's an adult now. Maybe I understand what he needs better than you do.<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> I appreciate your honesty, dear.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> And here's some more honesty: I don't like you very much.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, maybe I don't like you either.</p>", "3239": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to like each other. Well, we have a 4:30 reservation at Applebee's.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I think I should leave.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But why? Other than you two fighting, we're having such a good time.</p>", "3240": "<p><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Let her go. And under no circumstance will you give her that engagement ring.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> What ring?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe we should give them some privacy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah. You go ahead. I'll catch up with you.</br></p>", "3241": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, it's not my fault if American women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes.</p>", "3242": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow. The last time I saw my grandma, the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything.</p>", "3243": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> All right. I've made up my mind. I'm gonna do the right thing, call this girl, and let her know that I'm in a relationship.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, so far we've heard, \"Made up my mind, I'm dumping Emily.\"<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> \"Made up my mind to date both of them by pretending to be twin brothers.\"<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And \"Made up my mind, 'll ask for a threesome and if they say no, play it off as a joke.\"<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm calling her. And the threesome didn't deserve the belly laugh it got.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're right. It could totally happen. (laughing)</p>", "3244": "<p><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Fine. If you feel so strongly, I won't stand in your way.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So if he wanted to give me that engagement ring, we would have your blessing?<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> I suppose.<br/>\n(Amy rub's Sheldon's shoulder and smiles)<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I just gave you my virginity, woman. Cool your jets!</p>", "3245": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, so I saw a movie trailer the other day. How could Batman possibly fight Superman? I mean, isn't that dumb?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Maybe he uses Kryptonite.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Well, Batman's got a lot of money. Maybe he builds a suit that can do everything Superman can do.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, no, no, no, no. I've seen that movie. It's called Iron Man.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (softly) What is happening?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> But it's beautiful.</p>", "3246": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> And now Ben Affleck is Batman?<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Oh, he was great in Shakespeare in Love.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, we should watch that next girls' night.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We could do a double feature with the Leonardo DiCaprio Romeo + Juliet.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I love me some Leo.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And it's gone.</p>", "3247": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I had a 101 fever. If that's not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, when you're sick, you can be unbearable. That's why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it's ended.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, no, not just that. I mean Detroit is beautiful when it's sleeting.</p>", "3248": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, Stuart.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hey. Where's Sheldon? Still sick?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, he's fine. We just needed a little break.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Yeah, I get that. When I brought him his comics the other day, he said, \"Oh, great, Death is literally at my door.\" He was being a jerk to everyone. Don't take it personally.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, I'm on so many antidepressants, I couldn't if I wanted to.</p>", "3249": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn't invite me?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't believe you're not on my side. I was on your side when someone stole your car radio.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Who else's side could you have been on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know. A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?</p>", "3250": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I understand that you're upset because you feel left out, but I don't know why we're even talking about this. Just apologize to them.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine, if that's what it takes to go on their dumb trip.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad. It's called empathy. It's something you could work on.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have empathy. Watch. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Great. Now try it as if this isn't your first day as a person.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. Hey, I felt a little something. Let me try again. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. I was mean to him. He must have felt terrible. Oh, now I feel terrible.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Neat! Glad I could help.</p>", "3251": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, here it comes. You tried to take care of me when I was sick, and I was mean to you. There's no excuse for that. And I'm truly sorry.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you. I appreciate that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I want you to know that that is sincere. I do feel bad. I'm not just saying it to be included on your trip.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Appreciate that, too.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Terrific. Now all that's left is for you to invite me to come. Me to ask, \"Are you sure?\" You to say, \"Absolutely.\" And then me to bring it home with, \"How could I say no to that face?\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're still not coming.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What? But I apologized and I meant it. I know that we don't play this game very often, but you're doing it wrong.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick. I'm not in a position to just say you can come.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, all right. What if I apologize to all of them?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fine, if you apologize to everyone, they all say it's okay, then yes, you can come.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Challenge accepted! Sounds like it's time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I hope it's as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My goodness! Do you remember \"comes with apsparagus\"?</p>", "3252": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You couldn't give us just one weekend?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I told him this was a bad idea.</p>", "3253": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good news, gentlemen. Amy's at a conference this weekend, which means I'm available to be entertained, hmm. As today's youth might put it: Who wants to get their Sheld-on?</p>", "3254": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, then it looks like we have a winner. Congratulations.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I should warn you, it's just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, stop selling it, kid. You won.</p>", "3255": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How was your day?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, not good. Still couldn't get in to see Dr. Gallo.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A doctor? Well, I hope you're not contagious. I've got a weekend in the telescope room I've been excited about for almost three minutes.</br></p>", "3256": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I can be helpful. Give me something to do. You know, my father took me to work once, and in ten minutes I figured out who'd been stealing from the cash register.<br/>\nIt was my father. Yeah, Dad lost his job, but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle.</p>", "3257": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.<br/><strong>Dr. Gallo:</strong> Ah, it's my pleasure. I'm curious, are you related to Dr. Beverly Hofstadter?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, she's my mother. You know her?<br/><strong>Dr. Gallo:</strong> No, not personally, but I have read all of her books.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, then you know her better than I do.<br/><strong>Dr. Gallo:</strong> Well, I'm not so sure about that. But I can tell you I do not agree with her theories on child rearing at all.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? Any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?<br/><strong>Dr. Gallo:</strong> Well, I didn't want to say it-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, no, say it. Sing it. Rent a plane, write it in the sky.</p>", "3258": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother - nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life - I told her about you and your drug; she said she'd be happy to meet you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? Oh, you're the best husband ever!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So you'll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I guess.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time.</p>", "3259": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's a great idea. I've got it. We'll call it \"Cooper\".<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How is that both our names?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> \"Koo\" from Koothrappali and \"per\" from Cooper.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, so it's, like, \"Kooper\" with a \"K\"?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nah, you're right, that's dumb.</p>", "3260": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Leonard, great news. We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wow, that's amazing! I'm in a pretty great mood today myself.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. Guess we're gonna talk about you now.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo made me realize that I'm a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you.</p>", "3261": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Arthur, what brings you back?<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Beats me. I just hope this is not a sex dream.</p>", "3262": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Where are you going?<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> I don't know, but hopefully somewhere I can wear pants.</p>", "3263": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Okay. Once the man gets the woman out of her bloomers-</p>", "3264": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Tonight's the night!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, the wait is finally over.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know, then you'll finally stop talking about it.</p>", "3265": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, hey, Wil. What'cha doing?<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> I was on Star Trek. I'm just rooting for the home team.</p>", "3266": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, if you don't like Star Wars, why are you here?<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Oh, I'm just having fun. Everyone takes Star Wars so seriously, like if the movie's bad it's going to ruin their lives.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Is it bad? Did you hear something? Oh my God, it's bad. Somebody kill me!</p>", "3267": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> See, that's what I mean. When you wake up in the morning, whether this is the greatest movie ever or a total piece of crap, your life isn't going to change at all.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> He's right.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. No matter what happens, we're coming back tomorrow to watch it again.</p>", "3268": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I'm going to stay positive. I told him what women liked and, after he stopped giggling, he seemed pretty sure of himself.</p>", "3269": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.</p>", "3270": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, yes, I was hoping you could help me. What song is this? (Hums a tune(<br>\nYou don't know? Well, how dare you call yourselves a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. My goodness. Do you sing along to the greatest hits of Elvis Presley with that mouth?</br></p>", "3271": "<p><strong>Dave:</strong> Let me just check my schedule, he said, trying to seem like a man with things on his schedule.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> How about Saturday?<br/><strong>Dave:</strong> Uh, hmm Let me see. Uh, Friday, farmers' market with Jay Z. Sunday, piano shopping with Elton John. Saturday works.</p>", "3272": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Did you know, at the United Nations, there's a Department for Outer Space Affairs? <strong>Howard:</strong> Really? Why?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Mmm, boy, that's one of those jobs that's boring, boring, boring. Then, \"Oh, God! Where's the memo with what we do now?!\"</p>", "3273": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> We did raise the roof that night.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, we totally did.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?</p>", "3274": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What do you want to write?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Something bad-ass. You know, like \"Thanks for diggin' our vibe. \"We'll keep rockin' if you keep rollin'.\"<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Dude, if I was wearing a bra, I'd throw it at your head right now.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'll keep rockin'. You don't do that.</p>", "3275": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I shouldn't be surprised. There's a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on, Sheldon. There are plenty of smart people who don't have mental problems.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yup, she's right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue, there's an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you.</p>", "3276": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Better. You're the lint trap of my love.</p>", "3277": "<p><strong>Dave:</strong> Okay, then. I'll, uh, see myself out. Amy, thank you for dinner.<br/>\nDr. Cooper, pleasure to meet you, sir. Uh, if perhaps sometime you have a spare moment, I'd, uh, love-love to discuss physics, or shoot the breeze, as you Yanks say.<br/>\nAh, what a lovely evening.</p>", "3278": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Wipe that smug smile off your face.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe I'm happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Are you and I close enough for me to say-<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That he's an ass? He beat you to it.</p>", "3279": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Ready for the aquarium?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am. You know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends, I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> If that makes you more comfortable.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable, lists would be on the top of that list.</p>", "3280": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So we don't even get to be up front where the action is?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What difference does it make?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. I was hoping some poor kid would come up to me and say, (affecting a high-pitched, British accent) \"Please, sir, I want some more.\"<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You're in a soup kitchen, not a production of Oliver!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's not like I'm expecting them to sing.</p>", "3281": "<p><strong>Elon Musk:</strong> You think you might ever get back out to space?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Is that a job offer? 'Cause I really want to go to Mars. Assuming I can bring my wife. She hardly takes up any room. She's basically a carry-on.<br/><strong>Elon Musk:</strong> Well, we're not quite there yet, but we're always looking for engineers.<br/>\nSo let me give you my e-mail. We can stay in touch.</p>", "3282": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You're just upset 'cause they ran out of Pilgrim hats.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They gave one to that baby. He wasn't even awake.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, it wouldn't be a holiday without you being mad at a baby.</p>", "3283": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, your turn.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hmm. Seal, hagfish, SpongeBob SquarePants.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I'd befriend SpongeBob but he's not real, so I can't do that, can I?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> But you can pal around with a hagfish?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, let's not pull at that thread.<br/>\nOkay, I'll fight SpongeBob, because he's so friendly we'll just end up tickling each other. Um, I'll befriend the seal, because he's trainable, which was the problem I'm having with my current friends. Which means I'll have to eat the hagfish.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Isn't that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know. It makes its own gravy, it'll slide right down.</p>", "3284": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus, so I'm gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob.</p>", "3285": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Don't take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.</p>", "3286": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> We were on a date. Very much like this one.<br><strong>Dave:</strong> Mmm, I doubt it was like this one. I mean, he's a genius, and I wasn't even smart enough to figure out why my wife always smelled of croissants.</br></p>", "3287": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> 37 minutes left until the deadline.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Someone will show.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And no matter what happens, this is still a fun experiment.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives.</p>", "3288": "<p><strong>Dave:</strong> You know, I once drove 500 miles to hear him speak at Stanford.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I have a DVD of that lecture.<br/><strong>Dave:</strong> Really? Wasn't it great?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Not as a Valentine's present, no.</p>", "3289": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe she's waiting to show up at the last possible moment.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ugh, sounds like a drama queen. Oh, no. It is Jennifer Lawrence.</p>", "3290": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes. Don't take your shirt off just because the director said so.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is a documentary about Mr. Spock. I'm sure if there's nudity, it will be tasteful.</p>", "3291": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, Amy. It's Sheldon. Yeah, I know that we're broken up, but I'm leaving this message because I thought perhaps you'd like to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about Mr. Spock.<br/>\nOr as I like to call it, a Spockumentary.<br/>\nYeah, I'm going to use that joke in the interview, so try to laugh like you're hearing it for the first time.<br/>\nYou know, hysterically. And with a tinge of sadness that I'm no longer in your life.</p>", "3292": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> But what room?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How 'bout this one?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No way. No, this is the room I associate the most with my mom.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Then how 'bout the bathroom?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I want to change my answer.</p>", "3293": "<p><strong>Adam Nimoy:</strong> And what is your earliest memory of the character Spock?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The first episode of Star Trek: The Original Series I ever saw was \"The Galileo Seven.\" Uh, Spock had just landed on the planet Taurus II.<br/>\nThen my brother came in, sat on my head, and said, \"Eat farts.\" After that day, I was hooked.<br/>\nOn Star Trek, not my brother's sphincter-based cuisine.</p>", "3294": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Look, uh I don't even think you can take this wall down 'cause it's load-bearing.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, it's easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> When is your visa up?</p>", "3295": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy's DNA.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Um, doesn't Adam count as Leonard Nimoy's DNA?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No offense, but this is pure 100% Nimoy. Because of your mother, you're only 50%. Which isn't bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.</p>", "3296": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What else you hiding in there?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wouldn't you like to know?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I would.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right then. See, just my valuables. My passport, uh, my will-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You have a will?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah. My 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure.</p>", "3297": "<p><strong>Adam Nimoy:</strong> What about from when you were a kid?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, certainly.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground.<br/>\nI asked myself, \"What would Spock do?\" Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.<br/><strong>Adam Nimoy:</strong> Did it work?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no. He broke my collarbone. I can still hear it click.</p>", "3298": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, look! I found a seashell.<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> Yeah, that's a rat skull.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (shrieks)<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> Relax. There's enough droppings down here without you making more.</p>", "3299": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I can't believe Sheldon was gonna ask Amy to marry him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know. I also can't believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it.</p>", "3300": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So I should probably explain why I kind of fibbed.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> That would be nice.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I told my dad that you were the one who didn't want kids because I didn't want to disappoint him.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But you were okay throwing me under the bus?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Turns out yeah, I didn't think twice about it.</br></p>", "3301": "<p><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> Bernie, you don't need to worry about me. But I don't want to see you miss out. Raising children was the most rewarding experience of my life.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, please. Mom did everything. All you did was come home from work, sit on the couch and drink beer. How is that raising kids?<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> This is really a conversation for husband and wife. I'm gonna go clean up, hit the road. If your mother asks, I was here till 10:00.</p>", "3302": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It's interesting your father didn't help around the house and Howard doesn't help, either, so in a way, Howard's not only like your father, but he's also like the child that you're afraid to have.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why are you still here?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Fine, I'll leave. But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper.</p>", "3303": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, now instead of idolizing fictional characters, you can focus on the real people who are already in your life.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Those are very wise words.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They'd just be so much more comforting if they came out of a television.</p>", "3304": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, Barry, we're in trouble. We need liquid helium. Does the department have any we can use?<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Sorry, there's a shortage. And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But you won't need much for that.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> True, but if it's successful, I'm having a party with balloons.</p>", "3305": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us, I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs are my favorite toothpick-delivered meatball.</p>", "3306": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, you know who went out on a date the other night? Stuart.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, good for him.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I thought so, too.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?</p>", "3307": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, so how does it work?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Ah, well, it shows me all the single women in a five-mile radius who are using the app. If I like the way they look, I hit thumbs up. If I don't, thumbs down.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> First time it happens I will let you know.</p>", "3308": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What'd he say?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He's got what we need and can meet us tonight.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, really? You know I don't like buying things at night.<br/>\nJanuary 7, 2009. I went to the Ralph's at 11:30pm to pick up Cracklin' Oat Bran for the morning, and what did I see?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The man restocking the cereal shelves.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's right. And what did he do?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (shudders) It's like it was yesterday.</p>", "3309": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That must be him.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, of course. A nondescript, white panel van.<br/>\nYou may be familiar with it from the sentence: \"Their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van.\"</p>", "3310": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And I'm sorry I lied about being a wedding planner who can't find love. Although I am currently single, if you know anybody.</p>", "3311": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> He wants more money.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. That's all I've got on me.<br/><strong>Dealer:</strong> That's exactly how much it is.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Finally, something breaks our way.</p>", "3312": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, the Swedes might beat us, but at least we won't get gang-noogied in prison.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you've seen?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It scared me straight, Leonard.</p>", "3313": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, ready for lunch?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, one sec.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit so she can track how much I'm exercising.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That'll teach her to care about your health.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, I can't wait to see the look on her face when I die young.</p>", "3314": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> When was the last actual exercise you got?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The other day when she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her.</p>", "3315": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I think it's great you guys want to get more exercise, but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you saying? We're not coordinated enough to play sports?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, Leonard, sweetheart, you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I got a triple-word score with a double letter Q. If that's not a time to bust out the Scrabble dance, what's the point of having one?</br></p>", "3316": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Barry Kripke started a fencing club.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's indoors, so no sunscreen.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No throwing, no catching, no running.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No gym shorts that can be yanked down.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Or worse, up.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Preach.</p>", "3317": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And as an added bonus, the word touche comes from fencing. It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What about a game of tag on a French school yard?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah, touche.</p>", "3318": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Gentlemen, welcome to the fencing club. Before we start, I just want to warn you, fencing isn't a joke. I hope you're not here because you think it's going to be like Star Wars.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's not why we're here.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, I'm here because I think it's gonna be like Game of Thrones.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And maybe a little Princess Bride.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ooh, ooh! I forgot about Princess Bride! That's my answer!</p>", "3319": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, have you read the online reviews for this place?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Eh, the Internet's so negative. I try to avoid it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All right. Well, Heather H. says, \"The owner stared at me the whole time and didn't blink once.\"<br/>\nKelly M. says, \"The creepy guy who runs it asked me out, then called himself stupid before I could say no.\"<br/>\nJessica K. says, \"I told the weird owner that I liked his shirt. He took it off and gave it to me.\"<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> See? Negative.</p>", "3320": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> En garde, Leonard. Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching.</p>", "3321": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look at this blister. Like it or not, we're athletes now.</p>", "3322": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, what are you gonna do?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't know. I guess I assumed that I would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What can it hurt?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I was hoping the next person I dated would be a little less like Sheldon.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You mean, not a scientist?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I think she means not a weirdo.</p>", "3323": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I tried fencing today.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> How'd that go?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It was pretty easy. And I think my background in \"mathletics\" helped.</p>", "3324": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What's up?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why does your Fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday?</p>", "3325": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just a few more signatures, and we'll be finished.<br/>\nInitial here to acknowledge that you've returned your key.<br/>\nOkay.<br/>\nAs my future neighbor, I'd like you to have a key.<br/>\nInitial here to acknowledge you received it.</p>", "3326": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm proud of you. You're taking this really well.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, it's not like I'm never going to see you two again. Which brings us to article 23 subsection C. Please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do I really have to do that now?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, but if you want chicken and get stuck with the fish, that's on you.</p>", "3327": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, remember The Ark of the Covenant?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's how much we're gonna melt people's faces off.</p>", "3328": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In general, would you say that you smell better, worse or the same as you do right now?</p>", "3329": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're healthy. You have a job in the sciences. I've got to say, if this credit report comes back good, you're the frontrunner.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (via video chat) I'm not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I met with 11 people, and they all walked out. And that Hollywood phony Chris Pratt never tweeted me back.</p>", "3330": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What happened to me, Amy? Years ago I was completely disengaged from my feelings. I'd say it was a happier time, but I was disengaged from my feelings, so who can tell?</p>", "3331": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't know how to help you. You know, feelings are a part of life.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They didn't used to be. You and Leonard and Penny, you all poisoned me with emotions. I was like the Tin Man, perfectly content until that evil Wizard gave him a heart.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't think that was the point of the movie.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine, then I was like Pinocchio before that jerk Geppetto went and made him a real boy.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> There you go.</br></p>", "3332": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hang on. Wait, you actually think it's 2003?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, just because I'm living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn't mean I'm delusional.<br/>\nAnd since it is 2003, I don't know who you are, so please exit the premises before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone.</p>", "3333": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you doing okay?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I guess. I'm just, you know, worried about Sheldon.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, come on, he's a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s. He's fine.</p>", "3334": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What else can you do? Move back in with him?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, of course not. I just feel bad.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, so do I, but don't you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want? And have your body tell you when it's time to go to the bathroom? You know, not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I did like that he had the weather on it.</p>", "3335": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Trust me, this is the right thing.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know. And it's not like we're abandoning him.<br/>\nPlus, we can FaceTime him whenever we want, you know, once iPhones are invented in his universe.</p>", "3336": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, if you're open to living with someone great, I'll give you $1,000 to take Stuart.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You really should've gone on the Internet and checked how long that kind of thing lives before you got one.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm sorry. I just thought you might have a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life.</p>", "3337": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know what you're doing. You're trying to get attention so we'll feel bad for you, but it's not happening.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, what I'm doing is trying to figure out how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Will you knock it off? We're across the hall.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As the kids are saying today, \"talk to the hand.\"<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> They're not saying that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They are in 2003.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, no. They're really not.</p>", "3338": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> \"Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One runs from Loki, the other runs from stones.\"<br/>\nSo, what do you think?<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Wow.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Runs from stones means that-that big boulder, but I couldn't rhyme anything with boulder.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Colder, shoulder, soldier, folder.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Right, yeah, right.</p>", "3339": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just give me one minute, and I'll get started on a new Roommate Agreement.<br/>\nYeah, nothing from Pratt. We're good.</p>", "3340": "<p>Raj and <strong>Howard:</strong> Indy' whip snapped. Thor's hammer missed. It was Avenger vs archeologist. Indy held his ground. And straightened his fedora. Thor said, \"That's a nice look In 1944-a\".<br/>\nThor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning. The other plays with bones. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning. The other plays with bones.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Play something we can dance to.</p>", "3341": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I'd hardly call this kidnapping. Where's the blindfold? Where's the duct-tape? Where's the part where you call me and demand ransom? And I try to keep you on the phone but you hang up seconds before I can trace it. And then I say, \"I'm getting too old for this crud.\"</p>", "3342": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's bad enough that I'm being taken against my will. I don't see why it has to be in some hippie's mobile sex dungeon.</p>", "3343": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, are you going to give us a clue where we're headed?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay. Let's see. They've got spicy food and there's a chance you'll get diarrhoea.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> India.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> We can drive there.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Your house?</p>", "3344": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Come on, Leonard's doing bachelor stuff. You sure we can't take you to a strip club?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Nah, if I want to see a naked dancing man, I just flush the toilet while Leonard's in the shower.</p>", "3345": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, watch your speed. I hear the Mexican police target tourists.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, not a problem. If anything goes down, we just put Koothrappali in the driver's seat and slap a sombrero on his head.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Dude, how many races can you offend in a single breath?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. Have you watched the Olympics with me?</br></p>", "3346": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I usually don't put too much stock in charms and talismans. However, even I must admit feeling Richard Feynman's butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, I have to return this van.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Keep your creative juices in your pants.</p>", "3347": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What was that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I think it's a tire.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What if it's banditos shooting at us? What if we get kidnapped? What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson pinatas for the rest of our lives?</p>", "3348": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How long do you think you can keep it from him?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, isn't it gonna get worse the longer you wait?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, not necessarily. You know, Dad's not getting any younger, so if I wait long enough, I'll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical.</p>", "3349": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> When did you learn how to change a tire?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Every self-respecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If I see one scorpion, I am getting on someone's shoulders and never coming down.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And there's your damsel.</p>", "3350": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> There you go, you're all done!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That wasn't so bad. Nice!<br/>\nBoy, if my mom could see me now, she'd lock me in the sin closet.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's a joke, right?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Actually, the joke was on her. I could still see the TV through the slats.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm starting to see why you and your mom aren't very close.</p>", "3351": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You put up a good fight, lug nut, but you've met your match.</p>", "3352": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why are you up?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How am I supposed to sleep? I've been married less than twenty-four hours and my wife isn't speaking to me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perhaps you can think of this in a more positive light. In one day, you've managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve.</p>", "3353": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What are you doing here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm here to return your belongings. That's what people who've broken up do.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And you didn't do your compulsive knocking ritual so I'd open the door?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> On the contrary, you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. We're not friends with benefits.</p>", "3354": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> If you think about it, without you he never would have grown into the person he is now. I mean sure, more women may notice him, but I think it's better to have a guy be with you because he wants to be, and not because he doesn't think he has any other choice.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I never thought about it like that.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Me neither. Not until just now.</p>", "3355": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Tonight's theme: Flags of countries that have been torn apart, and the women I have a feeling were responsible.</p>", "3356": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh-huh.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I've been thinking about it and you might be right. But the good news is I'm pretty sure I know why.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm listening.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny, after all these years I still feel like maybe I don't deserve you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, that is the lamest excuse you could have possibly come up. But I get it.</p>", "3357": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Buddy, I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me, like I do to you when you say dumb things.</p>", "3358": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You wrote vows?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't have any. You're kind of making me look bad.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't have to say them.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, go ahead. I'll come up with something mushy, you'll cry. We've got this.</p>", "3359": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Nicely done.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Finally there's a Mrs. Hofstadter who isn't disappointed in me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, the night is still young.</p>", "3360": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Listen. If you're imagining that it was sexy, it wasn't. We were both drunk and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Did you feel guilty?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, she had dental insurance.</br></p>", "3361": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Well, honey, don't send it back yet. Your sister's married, and I'm not letting your brother give my grandmother's ring to that whore he's dating.</p>", "3362": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wow. Marriage must agree with you. You are just glowing.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm not glowing. I'm upset.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.</p>", "3363": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Knock, knock, knock, Penny. Knock, knock, knock, Penny. Knock, knock, knock, Penny.</p>", "3364": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, this might sound far-fetched, but I'm on the market now. If I dated Mandy, that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's ridiculous.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, you're right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem is so low she could be with Leonard.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm with Leonard.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I know. Forever.</p>", "3365": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do what makes her happy? She plays the harp and her car is paid for. How much happier can she be?</p>", "3366": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you.<br/>\nAnd slam it hard, because I am pretty steamed.</p>", "3367": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You're one to talk. You've been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I don't see you showing him the door. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's not the same thing. Emily's a person. Stuart's more like an infestation, something you spray for.</p>", "3368": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someone's feelings as I am.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's not true. We were just laughing right in your face.</p>", "3369": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Still haven't heard from her? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, and I'm confused. It's been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out she's wrong by now.</p>", "3370": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Did you eat all my yoghurt? <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You mean the one that makes ladies do the thing that ladies pretend they don't do even though they do? <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You know... which yoghurt I mean.</p>", "3371": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> When he gets home, I'm dropping the hammer. <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Ooh, I like when you take charge. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, I'm not taking charge. You're the hammer.</p>", "3372": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not just the date. We haven't talked about anything. Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor... <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Outdoor? Oh. I can RSVP no right now.</p>", "3373": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, well, I want it in a church. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fine. I want black-tie. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Fine. I want to release butterflies. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Seriously? Airborne worms?</p>", "3374": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay. Well, then it's settled: small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sounds perfect. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Great. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You still didn't pick a date. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Stay out of it! <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Shut up!</p>", "3375": "<p><strong>Emily:</strong> It's a beautiful night. <br><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, yes, we've got the moon and the trees and Elizabeth McNulty, who apparently died when she was the same age I am.</br></p>", "3376": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, next, why don't we tackle your penchant for whining and Penny's love of the old glug-glug?</p>", "3377": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I felt bad for finishing your yoghurt, so I bought more. And, Howard, your favourite fruit is in season. Crunch Berries. <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Don't let that sway you. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's hard not to. They taste so much better than real berries.</p>", "3378": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Look, I care about you a lot, but we are very different people. <br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Are you breaking up with me? <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, no, I'm just pointing out that you're dark on the inside and I'm dark on the outside.</p>", "3379": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So... we're still getting married? <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because we love each other. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And it's the happiest day of our lives. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> *short laugh* Don't push it.</p>", "3380": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can do that. From now on, this mouth, you and food. That's it.</p>", "3381": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sure, his mom gets roses. When I want them, they're a \"bouquet of severed plant genitals.\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You act like I didn't get you that mushroom log on Valentine's Day.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> He's right. Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years.</p>", "3382": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I change my answer. It's amazing. It's hot. We can barely keep our hands off each other. <br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Seems odd to try and impress your mother with your sexual prowess. But then, you always did have that unresolved Oedipal complex. </p>", "3383": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I read your paper. It was very impressive.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, thank you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper? <br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Of course I did, but it's a mother's job to make sure her child's self-esteem is not dependent on anyone's approval. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's so sweet, you think I have self-esteem.</p>", "3384": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> How was your flight? <br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Very pleasant. And yours? <br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Lovely. Almost as if someone - not saying who - was watching over the plane.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> You're kidding, right? <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Subtle, mom, real subtle.</p>", "3385": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Mary, I'm curious. When did you first realize that your son had such a remarkable mind? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.</p>", "3386": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Sounds like Sheldon was a handful. <br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh, he was a handful. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was a handful. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You still are.</p>", "3387": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Guys. In the time you've been sitting here playing video games, I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank. <br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I put on pants. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Kiss-ass.</p>", "3388": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Shelly does not like change. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> True. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen.</p>", "3389": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> We're not in a rush. We'll set a date when the time is right. <br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> It doesn't matter, sweetie. The moment a man lays with a woman, they are married in the eyes of the Lord. <br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Ugh.</p>", "3390": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Bernadette's not wrong. She does work hard around here. <br><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, maybe it's a good thing if she stops babying you so much. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She doesn't baby me. <br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I saw her pull you home in a wagon. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> For your information, I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck.</br></p>", "3391": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I'm terribly sorry that I upset your mother. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, it's all right. She'll forgive you. She has to or she goes to hell.</p>", "3392": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term you're looking for is a double mother suckler<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, you're right. That is the term I'm looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler! <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out, how dare you?</p>", "3393": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Fascinating. How can someone as enlightened as Sheldon come from someone like you?</p>", "3394": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not my fault your mother likes me better than she does you.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, don't flatter yourself. She likes everybody better than she likes me.</br></p>", "3395": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But still, you need to consider how successful Leonard's brother and sister are.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I suppose.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.</p>", "3396": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Do you suppose you would have flourished more in a more reward-based environment?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perhaps. But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped up hot dogs whenever I wanted, so who cares.</p>", "3397": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, and you certainly don't have to earn my love.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Of course you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit.</p>", "3398": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> There's something I need to say to you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh really? That's too bad.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Leonard, I always made you earn my affection. But today I realized that there's more than one way to raise a child.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I taught her that!<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Therefore, I would like to initiate a new protocol wherein I shower you with unconditional love.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wow. When does that start?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> So needy.</p>", "3399": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. It's pretty exciting.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aren't you afraid of being blinded?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How would I be blinded?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> At the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointed hats in the air. It's all \"Pomp and Circumstance\" until someone loses an eye.</p>", "3400": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I'm excited to show you around. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You think we'll have time to visit your mom over there? <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes. We'll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press, but I'm not doing that either.</p>", "3401": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the camera's on, they're both on the same network. We should be getting an image.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All I see is a black screen, and my own reflection. I look sad.</p>", "3402": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I have to return the helicopter. My father-- What did you do?! <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't worry. He went to MIT. He can solve any problem. As long as it doesn't originate in a Russian man's colon.</p>", "3403": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why don't you just call tech support? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey! <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Whoa! <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Not cool! <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What? <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> There's two kinds of people in this world. Those who call tech support and those who make fun of the people who call tech support.\n</p>", "3404": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, the power supply is reconnected. I think we're back in business. Let's just run a few tests before we take it outside. Sheldon, we got WiFi? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Check. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> GPS? <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Check. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Battery charged? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Check. <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Four hours of our lives gone? Check.</p>", "3405": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> All right. All systems go. In five... <br><strong>Boys:</strong> ...four, three, two, one. <br/>\n*An electrical crackle is heard and smoke comes out of the drone*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's what my train used to do.</br></p>", "3406": "<p><strong>Tech Support:</strong> Tech Support. Can I help you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, it's a robot uprising! Call the police!</p>", "3407": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sweetie, you know you're supposed to wear clothes under a graduation gown?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> A. Surprised you know that. B. I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you.</p>", "3408": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You are a wise man. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, Penny, who's smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice? <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I guess you're right. Maybe it is the person who asks. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, it's the wise man.</p>", "3409": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That would be more helpful if E.T. were real. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> My God, when he's on the table and they use the paddles on him. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And he's all white. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> They zip him up in that bag. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And Gertie can't stop crying. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The flower dies. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, let's talk about something else.</p>", "3410": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So it sounds like we need a way to communicate that's simple. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And doesn't require outside machinery to be built to access it. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's also a problem because we don't even know if the aliens who find this can see. I mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Like when my dog is mad at me, she tells me by peeing in my slippers.</p>", "3411": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's actually a valid example. Animals do deliver messages through scent.\n<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny has about 20 different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.</p>", "3412": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message, maybe we should talk about what the message could be. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I never cared for that. It's advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy *squeezes Leonard* we are. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Squeeze yourself! <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, don't be offended. You know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency.</p>", "3413": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing Leonard.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's not always. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabba's head, and I got to be his fat slug butt. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We looked great. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You let a guy sit on me. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> He was dressed as Princess Leia. It made a nice picture.</p>", "3414": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I mean, the whole experience reminded me about how much I hated about that world. You-you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity. I don't want to feel those things. I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things.</p>", "3415": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I can't believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I did. I mean, I walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out.</p>", "3416": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just out of curiosity, why didn't you ask Leonard for advice about this?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Urgh, because I already know what he'll say. Wah, wah, wah. You shouldn't do it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah, it's just like he's here.</p>", "3417": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You guys know the new discovery class missions that NASA's been working on?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, they're looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> When I encountered alien life, I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.</p>", "3418": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You can't breathe our air without an inhaler. He's allergic to Earth nuts, but I'm the alien.</p>", "3419": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now, we can play this one of two ways. You can say, \"Trains! Tell me more,\" or, you can just look at me like that and I'll start.</p>", "3420": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What's going on in here?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> I am making molecular cocktails. This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh. How do you drink it?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit.</br></p>", "3421": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You don't think I'm a leader? <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I was kidding. Of course you are. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Right. I couldn't change if I wanted to. <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You better not change, because I love who you are. Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you're done or can you do it all by yourself? <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> All by myself. <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> There's my big boss man.</p>", "3422": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, Bernadette, have you thought about how you're going to redecorate this place? <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You know, I'm thinking ripping up the carpets, maybe lose the wallpaper, all new light fixtures.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, if you knocked out this wall, it would give you an open floor plan, and then-- it's a little scary, but could be fun-- indoor fire pit.</p>", "3423": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why don't you help with the coffee? <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, but something smells fishy. And not just because you work around sea animals. That actually sounds interesting, and I'd like to learn more about it.</p>", "3424": "<p><strong>Josh:</strong> I can't believe my brother's an astronaut. That's amazing. What was it like? <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Listen, dude, it's time for you to hit the road. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, hey, the young man asked a good question.</p>", "3425": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> *to Wil Wheaton* Give me back that juice.</p>", "3426": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I went to school for half my life. I have a doctorate. I'm still paying off college loans. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, how much do you owe? Maybe I can help you out. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit? <br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> For those of you at home, I am shaking my head \"no.\"</p>", "3427": "<p><strong>Kevin Smith:</strong> Anyway, man, I dug the ape movie, Penny. And I thought you were, like, really great in it. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aw. <br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> You know, I'm in the movie, too. <br/><strong>Kevin Smith:</strong> Yeah, whatever.</p>", "3428": "<p><strong>Kevin Smith:</strong> Oh, I'm hanging up now.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Don't you listen to him, buddy. You're awesome. You're one of the greatest directors of our time. <br/><strong>Kevin Smith:</strong> I don't have a part for you, Wheaton.</p>", "3429": "<p><strong>Kevin Smith:</strong> Hey, man, yo, is everything okay, Wil? 'Cause it's been, like, two minutes and you haven't even brought up Stand By Me.</p>", "3430": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wil, I'm begging you. Please turn that off.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Sure. *turns recording off* *turns recording on* And we're back.<br/></p>", "3431": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than Sheldon.</p>", "3432": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> We had one of these growing up. I used to play all the time.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh yeah, I loved ping pong.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I meant beer pong.</p>", "3433": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, they're requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And this music we're listening to right now is funky as well?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It could be.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So it's like the musical equivalent of Russell's Paradox. The question of whether the set of all sets that don't contain themselves as members contains itself.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Exactly.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well then, I hate it. Music should just be fun.</p>", "3434": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aren't you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If we do, we'll just tell him to hit the bricks, see.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Seems a little confrontational, but all right.</p>", "3435": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yoda's swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. That's code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in.</br></p>", "3436": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You can't just decide. How about I arm wrestle you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's not fair. That's like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest.</p>", "3437": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How is that fair? You grew up with a table.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the Thundercats for control of a bra I had found in the woods.</p>", "3438": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who Leonard has made me sit through, I will play on your behalf and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey, where I hate that I know it belongs.</p>", "3439": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> If you still have that bra, I'll give you a nickel for it.</p>", "3440": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We don't have an appointment. And we don't belong here, but we're like crazy big fans. Crazy for Star Wars crazy, not like we have a backpack full of duct tape. Although we do have a backpack that you really don't want to look in.</p>", "3441": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him.</p>", "3442": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, we have defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We're trying to get past a security guard. Not rescue Zelda.</p>", "3443": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? A recording session I must attend.</p>", "3444": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Come on, Raj. You are the King Kong of Ping Pong. You are the Menace of Table Tennis. Put her away, 'cos I don't have a third one.</p>", "3445": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you think they're gonna call the police?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. Maybe they'll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think that's below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer. Storm troopers would really be the ones-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, shut up!</p>", "3446": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And, for all the times you find me irritating, today you got to watch someone shoot me with a taser.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That part was pretty good.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> See.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You did flop around a lot.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll take your word for it. I was too busy trying not to defecate.</p>", "3447": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you still mad at me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes. We missed our lecture, we were almost arrested, and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee.</p>", "3448": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can see the ranch, Leonard! Oh, it's rustic, it's lovely. I'd take a picture, but people are chasing me. I'm going to make it! I'm going to make it! They have tasers, but they wouldn't dare use-- Aaaaaaah!</p>", "3449": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> New salon topic: What's more important-- an idea or its execution?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, that's fun.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good for you, Leonard. That's a lovely little notion. Kind of like \"I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago.\" Yeah, and I'll stand back while I invent the telephone. *holds invisible telephone to ear* Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, it's your uncle. He says you just got burned.</p>", "3450": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have mixed feelings about interviews. I like the part where I talk, but I do not like the part where the other man talks.</p>", "3451": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, this article doesn't mention Leonard at all.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that can't be right.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It only refers to Dr. Cooper and his team. Did you even talk about him?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All I did was answer a few questions about the theory, and then express my gratitude that Scientific American doesn't include any of those smelly perfume cards.</br></p>", "3452": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Poor Leonard.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific  American. He ought to be thrilled.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> He might not be.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Maybe you're right. He is kind of a lump.</p>", "3453": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Remember that time you didn't get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that kid!<br/>\nPoor Leonard.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Exactly. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For the record, that kid was a terrible choice. If you cry when you drop your churro, you do not have what it takes to rule England.</p>", "3454": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, how about this? Let's invite everyone over to dinner. It'll be like Ma's feeding us one last time.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I love that.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Me too. Oh look, we've got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it.</p>", "3455": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Please, I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people.<br/>\nA new clothing size between medium and large called Marge.<br/>\nSnow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won't Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.</p>", "3456": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay. So we've got three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagne.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, that's noodle kugel.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> One Jewish lasagne.</p>", "3457": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> And one giant container of matzah ball soup.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Ma, always kept it on hand. In case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning, from her cooking.</p>", "3458": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm never gonna talk to her again.</p>", "3459": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Stuart, have you thought about what you'd do if Howard sells the house?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> And there goes the mood.</p>", "3460": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> This food is amazing.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And not a vegetable in sight.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's not true. We've got tomatoes right here.</p>", "3461": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. It feels like we could be an eighteenth century French salon.</p>", "3462": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about the issues of the day.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Huh. So it's like The View.</p>", "3463": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women.</p>", "3464": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> The lead of the Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made Tor a female.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Who's Tor?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, Tor, the god of tunder.</p>", "3465": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> It's true. In the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet.</br></p>", "3466": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, new Salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago, or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss.</p>", "3467": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, now he's a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, please. His mother just died.</p>", "3468": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, well apparently, Leonard thinks he's better than everyone in the whole world. Including those fighting for our freedom. Well, I don't know about you, but I support our boys overseas.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And girls.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, you already ruined Thor, give it a rest.</p>", "3469": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey! Sheldon, Leonard, living room right now.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She said my name first. That must kill you.</p>", "3470": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't know what you think you're doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband. We're eating the last food his mother ever made. And you are going to throw it at each other like children? Whatever it is you're fighting about, put it aside, go back in there, be a good friend to Howard, or there's no dessert for either of you.</p>", "3471": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Look at me when I'm tawking to you!</p>", "3472": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You guys ever notice, sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't hear it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, not at all.</p>", "3473": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that's nonsense. I proclaimed my love for you. And the last time I looked in your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Other than the fact I had it, that was a magical night.</p>", "3474": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We're scientists, we can conduct our own research. I propose that we imprison two street people-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You didn't even let me finish.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Forget it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, so you can experiment on all the apes you want, but I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings, suddenly I'm the monster.</p>", "3475": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't believe in tempting fate. Same reason I wouldn't use a ouiji board or pick a fight with an Asian guy. Probably doesn't know karate, but why risk it?</p>", "3476": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As a Texas gentleman, I'm inclined to say ladies first. Although, I'm concerned that level of politeness and charm may make you fall in love with me before the test even begins.</p>", "3477": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As much as I'd love to meet Euclid, inventor of the geometric proof, he probably wore sandals and I can not look at toes during dinner.</p>", "3478": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What would constitute a perfect day for you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I'd probably sleep in. Do a little yoga. Then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks, and probably get a massage. Then probably cap off the night with some dancing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You didn't mention Leonard.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> He's there.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't think so. Leonard can't stand yoga, the beach, massages or dancing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, well, he brought a book.</p>", "3479": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What's yours?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I wake up. I enjoy some french toast with butter and syrup. Then a wormhole opens and whisks me millions of years into the future, where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Interesting you didn't mention Amy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who do you think made the french toast and syrup?</p>", "3480": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ladies,<br><strong>Emily:</strong> Are you being polite or scared?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yep.</br></p>", "3481": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, let's hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear.</p>", "3482": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I can't read people's minds. Actually, that's not true, I can read men's minds, but only because it's usually the one thing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When are we going to get robot eyes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're all alike.</p>", "3483": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So it would be today? Huh. Well, I suppose there's something satisfying about dying on my birthday.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Today's your birthday?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well that's always been a secret. Not even Amy knows.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I don't enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words \"George Lucas Director's Cut.</p>", "3484": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Given our new found intimacy, I'd say we have some hard choices to make.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Like what?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Gary Con. Do we fly or drive? Do we wear costumes? And if so, who gets to be Gary?</p>", "3485": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Just think about something else.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can I think about the spiny anteater?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke.<br/>\nThat didn't help at all.</p>", "3486": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You helped him?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own.</p>", "3487": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Whenever I'd see her, she'd say I was too skinny and would try and feed me.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> She did that to me, too.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Don't take this away from me.</p>", "3488": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My name is right on there with yours. That is a sure fire mark of quality. That might as well say \"Directed by Joss Whedon\".</p>", "3489": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Search for it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What? No. Why?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Because it would be fun to watch.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It would be humiliating.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well now we have two reasons.</p>", "3490": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, this is super-fluid helium. Put this in your mouth, your tongue will freeze and fall off.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Does it smell like blueberries?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Then we're probably okay.</p>", "3491": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> How are you today, Mr. Can You Believe These Jackasses?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Just dandy, Mr. I Wish I Was Better At Improv.</p>", "3492": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I've been poking around the internet and I think I've found something we'll enjoy watching even more.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What is it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, just a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay, I learned my lesson. Making fun of people is wrong.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I haven't learned my lesson, play it. Play it.</p>", "3493": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> \"With a heavy heart, Amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine. She  regretted giving Cooper the part he needed.\"<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Because she wanted him to give her the part she needed.</p>", "3494": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Have fun.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I will. Nothing more fun than a paradigm shifting evening of science.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (To Leonard) And you thought it was soaping me up in the shower.</p>", "3495": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not going to work today. And would you like to know why?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didn't make a break through, and now you're worried you made a huge mistake switching fields, and you're gonna sit around and sulk all day.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Like a big old baby.</br></p>", "3496": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You sounded in distress. I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you, like a murder or spontaneous coitus with Leonard.</p>", "3497": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'd like to ask you all to do something for me. Keep me on my toes. Just throw me off my game. Essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hold on. What's in it for us?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I suppose-<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, we'll do it!</p>", "3498": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What exactly do you think goes on here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, conversations that you wouldn't be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. You know, who has the best cervix. Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. Men's buttocks and how you want to pat and squeeze them.</p>", "3499": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What is going on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I need to keep my anxiety at the right level. So I'm using Darth Vader, the Joker and Godzilla's roar to keep me in that sweet spot. I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix, but turns out I love her.</p>", "3500": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, so it's one vote Emily, one vote Cinnamon. Penny, you're the tie breaker.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Say the quote again.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> \"It's just so perfect that we're both Libras.\"<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, this is just so hard. I'm gonna say Cinnamon.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Come on!</p>", "3501": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know he can be a lot of trouble, but when I see him laying here asleep like this, I just think, how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face.</p>", "3502": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> There's got to be something fun we can do that the guys will hate.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hang on, why do we have to hate it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Three words: Doctor Who convention.</p>", "3503": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ladies do love a guy dressed like a kitchen garbage bag.</p>", "3504": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you know what a disaster this is?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You mean because this room isn't supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine.</p>", "3505": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So your evil plan here is to buy your girlfriend a present?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's right. So stay on my good side, or maybe I'll get you a little something, too.</p>", "3506": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, if you don't mind me asking, do you think you might start dating again?<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> It's much too soon for that. Why, do you know someone?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, but if things don't work out with me and Leonard, I'll call you. Wait, how much do you talk about Star Trek?</p>", "3507": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> It's kinda boring. Although it did get exciting for a minute when Amy inhaled a wool ball.</p>", "3508": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-Giving, you're all crazy.</p>", "3509": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not the same thing. I don't think you know how I feel at all.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sad?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm, you do get me.</p>", "3510": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on, she's not that bad.<br><strong>Dan:</strong> Oh, yeah? At the company picnic she yelled at me and my grandson for losing the three-legged race. He still calls her that mean kid with the big boobies.</br></p>", "3511": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> When stuff like this gets me down, you know what I like to do?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sing Hakuna Matata like an eight-year-old girl?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wrong, smarty pants. It's \"Everything is Awesome\" from the Lego Movie.</p>", "3512": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It just builds character. Like my dad said, \"Nobody likes a cry baby but their moms and Democrats.\"</p>", "3513": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Penny told me that everyone's scared of me.<br/><strong>Dan:</strong> What? Why would she say that? You know she drinks, right?</p>", "3514": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> How can I be okay? I come from a broken home!</p>", "3515": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I really don't like how your wings poke me when we sleep because you're an angel.</p>", "3516": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Raj's parents probably split up because of Raj.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You always say the children aren't to blame, but (holds up a Raj coaster; chuckles) come on!</p>", "3517": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was not panicked, and I am not overly attached to Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me. You looove me.</p>", "3518": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> When Leonard comes out, he is not gonna feel great, so please don't give him a hard time.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Penny has a good point. This is like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck. Whatever you're thinking, just keep it to yourself.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It was like a grapefruit.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And I'm sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up next to it!</p>", "3519": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> So I met Jeanie at your Aunt Gladys's. She passed me the Manischewitz, I took one look at this punim, and almost plotzed on the kugel.</p>", "3520": "<p><strong>Dr. Lorvis:</strong> Can I ask you a question? You're a guy like me, how'd you get a girl like Penny?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, just being myself really.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh please. I'll tell you how he did it. Implacable relentless badgering. In urology terms, he was a drug-resistant staph infection and she was a urethra that could not shake him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know that I'd call myself an infection.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> A gallant man would defend his fiance for being called a urethra.</p>", "3521": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay. How about a little Miley Cyrus next?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who's he?</p>", "3522": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I remember it distinctly because I had just finished writing my poem commerating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss's death.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No one wants to hear it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why die? Why did he die? All told, I was told he was old.</p>", "3523": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, don't feel bad. I think we've all been distracted since the girls entered our lives.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You admit Amy's a distraction.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh very much so. Listen to this. This is from two days ago. \"Hi, hope you're having a good day.\" Who has time for this constant sexting?</p>", "3524": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait, wait, is 'brought' right?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Marty never had have had brought?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know, you did it to me.</p>", "3525": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Penny, let's go. We found a place that has Australian male strippers.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.</br></p>", "3526": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Since when do you read social science?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I go to the bathroom like everybody else.</p>", "3527": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, you bought cookies?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, fig newtons. I was going to ask which scientist both helped to discover calculus and had a famous cookie named after him. And then after someone said Newton, I was going to tell them they're wrong. The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts. And then I'd throw the cookies away.</p>", "3528": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I haven't been on a job interview in years. I'm really nervous.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Don't be. You're built for pharmaceutical sales. You're cute, you're flirty, and I started that like there were gonna be three things.</p>", "3529": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You just started seeing women naked again. I don't want you to be confused about where the boobs should be.</p>", "3530": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Let me save you all of your hemming and hawing. Sheldon already told me that you and Penny are engaged.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Would you like for me and you to talk more?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, it's probably fine.</p>", "3531": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Leonard, would it make you feel better to hear that your mother approved of your life choices?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, it would.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Yeah. Well, you should work on that.</p>", "3532": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, listen. There was something I was hoping to float past you. Now that Penny and I are engaged, I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course. She's spent many nights here, and you're worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm not.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good. Because not only has that ship sailed, if it hit an iceberg countless men would perish.</p>", "3533": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe I'll move in with Penny, or maybe she and I'll take this place and you can move across the hall.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Move across the hall?! Did you take a marijuana?</p>", "3534": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I see. You're putting your future bride's happiness above mine.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, yeah!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wow.</p>", "3535": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, this might work out for the best. You're always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when you're not there.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Euck, it's like walking into the Amazon. And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping, the awful one with birds and snakes.</p>", "3536": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Maybe you'll like living alone.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perhaps.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And if you don't, maybe you and I could live together.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, sure! While we're at it, why don't we get engaged, too? Why don't we get a little house, start a family, enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself woman?!</p>", "3537": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm helping you get back on your feet. I would like to purchase this comic book, please.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> It'll be $2.99.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? It's soaking wet.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Fine, $1.</p>", "3538": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> He can take care of himself. We went over Stranger Danger and gave him that whistle.</p>", "3539": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's dark out and he's alone. I don't like it. Let's go get him.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's sweet how you look out for him. You're a good guy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not just that. My mother would kill me if I let something happen to him.</p>", "3540": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I was wondering if I could crash at your place for a few nights.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Sure, of course. Oh, actually Emily was going to spend the night.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> You slept with her? Nice.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I can't take all the credit. She let me do it to her.</br></p>", "3541": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Seriously? You don't even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It's called living off the land.</p>", "3542": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> He'll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good Lord. Padawan is the student, not the teacher.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Seriously, let him go.</p>", "3543": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Aren't you going to get 3D glasses?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I brought my own. No sense in risking \"bridge of nose Herpes\".<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Is that a real thing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, until they invent nose condoms, I'm not finding out.</p>", "3544": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I'll make English Breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture, that's close enough.</p>", "3545": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> (Off screen) I'm hungry again!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's like the world's fattest cuckoo clock.</p>", "3546": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Penny, it's not about being famous. It's about the art. It's about the passion we have for our craft. *cell phone beeps* I have an audition for Sharnkado 2! If I book this, I am so going to pay you back for this beer.</p>", "3547": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> And you were so good in the commercial.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It was for haemorrhoid cream.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And I got itchy and swolen just watching you.</p>", "3548": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What took you so long? The grocery store's only a few blocks away.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.</p>", "3549": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> But before I take my shirt off, I need like ten minutes to do some crunches.</p>", "3550": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> May the force be with you. Get it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh no, this face wasn't because I didn't get it.</p>", "3551": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm working on the Star Wars day schedule. Now, I have a window built in, after Phantom Menace, for complaining. But I'm worried an hour won't be enough time.</p>", "3552": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Comforting you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly aren't.</p>", "3553": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Watching your old friend?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. Look at him, Amy. It's such a shame. Struck down in the prime of my life.</p>", "3554": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And watching a bunch of goofy space movies you've seen a hundred times isn't?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If we were in a physical relationship, you've just lost sex tonight.</p>", "3555": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Arthur Jeffries was a scientist. I'm sure he didn't care about stupid superstitions like funerals. If he were here, I think he'd say \"Enjoy Star Wars day\".<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> He was eighty-four. He'd say \"Where's my pudding?\"</br></p>", "3556": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Before you go, at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ohh, like Attack of the Clones. ... We are leaving right now!</p>", "3557": "<p><strong>Arthur:</strong> It's fantastic. This is the longest I've gone without running into a men's room in years.</p>", "3558": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why are you here?<br/><strong>Arthur:</strong> I don't know. I was hoping I was going to haunt my ex-wife.</p>", "3559": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why do I need you now?<br/><strong>Arthur:</strong> Well, as near as I can tell. You fell asleep watching Star Wars and now you're dreaming you're watching Star Wars.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Arthur:</strong> Don't you see a problem there? How you're spending your limited time on earth?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not at all.<br/><strong>Arthur:</strong> Okay. Good luck to you.</p>", "3560": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So we're about to film this scene in the movie where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> But I realize they're gluing  fur everywhere except my cleavage. So I ask the director and he says it's important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's sweet that he thinks there's a story.</p>", "3561": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> There's not even a bathroom on set. I have to go to the gas station across the street. I mean, I was dressed like half an ape and still not close to the most disgusting person in there.</p>", "3562": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy's sick.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aww, what's wrong with her?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, she talks a lot. Always wants to hold hands.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's not what I meant.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, if you were referring to her illness, your question should have been \"What ails her?\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What ails her?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, who knows.</p>", "3563": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Why would they lie to us?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's a good question.<br/>\n*Sheldon knocks three times on the restaurant window* Amy and Bernadette! [x3]<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why did you lie to us?</p>", "3564": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, let's get this over with. Eww, it's got someone's hair on it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, yeah. You're gonna do great with this movie.</p>", "3565": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know what, maybe I need a break from all of you. Come on, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Where are we going?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We're going to have Anything Can Happen Thursdays, you're going to tell me all about your science stuff and I'm going to complain about my movie, and we're going to support each other because that's what friends do.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. Because if I had to pick now, I'd probably go with dark matter-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Shut. Up.</p>", "3566": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, there's only one cookie with something in the middle that's solves life's problems and that's an Oreo. Or a nutterbutter if you're in a pinch.</p>", "3567": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Fine, I'll go. *Reads fortune cookie* \"People turn to you for guidance and wisdom.\" Hey, that's a good one.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, it's not.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> How's it not good?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Turn to you for wisdom? Clearly that cookie is mocking you. ... You'd never hear that sass from a nutterbutter.</p>", "3568": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense, I'd follow Leonard on Instagram.</p>", "3569": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You and I never hang out like this. Why is that?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I know, it's weird, right?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, we should do it more often.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, no. I mean this is weird right now.</p>", "3570": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's Penny.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Is she mad?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It doesn't seem like it. She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> A psychic? He considers them not only mumbo-jumbo, but extra jumbo mumbo-jumbo.</br></p>", "3571": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, Penny can be very persuasive. She's gotten me to do a lot of things I wouldn't normally do.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Because she has sex with you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, she does.</p>", "3572": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It took him a long time to get comfortable around me, too.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really? What did you do?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Something terrible in a former life? I don't know.</p>", "3573": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know what this is? And I reserve this word for those instances when it's truly reserved. This is malarkey.</p>", "3574": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I couldn't sleep.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I told you those Walking Dead pillows were a bad idea.</p>", "3575": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This seemed so elegant at the time, but now I realize I was just a dumb country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places.</p>", "3576": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As hard as this is I have to move on. I can't keep postulating multi-dimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs too!</p>", "3577": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why do we have a geology book? Leonard, did you throw a children's party while I was in Texas?</p>", "3578": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> How about we toast your new found freedom?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs. Why not soak it in grape juice that's been predigested by a fungus?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And you wonder why other children beat you with books. Cheers!</p>", "3579": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Two women at the same time? Nice job, playa!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Was it the two women thing or the \"playa\"? ... It was the playa.</p>", "3580": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> I tell you, this business is brutal. To this day I hate going on auditions. I walk in and I can just feel them thinking \"He was such a cute kid. What happened to him\"? Then I don't get the job and I can never find out why. Honestly, I get so depressed there are entire weeks where I can't even get out of bed.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, this was helpful!</p>", "3581": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Any news on your co-worker who's in the hospital?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> The poor thing. She was in surgery for eighteen hours. She's alive but she's still in critical condition.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh no.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> The one bit of good news is they put her in a medically induced coma before she read the card. So you know, silver linings!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Were you like this when I married you?</p>", "3582": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I had the same feeling when I made my dad buy a betamax instead of a VHS.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You were just a little kid.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A little kid who picked the wrong format to record the MacNeil/Lehrer Report.</p>", "3583": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I also was certain HD-DVD would win out over Blu-ray.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> How old were you then?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Old enough to know better!</p>", "3584": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Penny? We're working together. Awesome!</p>", "3585": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You can't leave. You're a murder suspect in the mysterious death of Stuart Bloom.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I didn't know his last name was Bloom.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yeah, it's Bloom.</br></p>", "3586": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Got it. Hey, who's the murderer?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Any question but that.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sorry. Hey, who's not the murderer?</p>", "3587": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios. Including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising. FYI, we plan on selling out the human race hard.</p>", "3588": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, Stuart. Now I kinda feel bad for murdering you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, come on!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Penny did it! I win! Suck it, jackasses!</p>", "3589": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Anyway, she broke up with him and she's basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry. Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why.</p>", "3590": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I should let you know the world has changed since you were a young woman. It's not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation any more.<br/><strong>Mary:</strong> How old do you think I am?</p>", "3591": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> It actually was kinda fun.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You're just saying that.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yeah.</p>", "3592": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have an eidetic memory. I don't what his (Raj's) problem is.</p>", "3593": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, I don't think Meryl Streep ever had to say \"Must keep gorilla hands from killing again\".<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> If she did it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong.</p>", "3594": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ten years ago upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C3P0 and Peewee Herman. And he called me C3Peewee Herman.</p>", "3595": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> To this day I still get a monthly copy of \"Granny on Granny\". Which other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page is complete filth.</p>", "3596": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Remember the old days when I would point out that your check engine light is out?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. Penny, your check engine light is on.</p>", "3597": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, could you wrap it up? We're waiting on you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm sorry, is the fact my life's falling apart interfering with your board game?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It is.<br/>\n*Sheldon goes back into the apartment*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You were wrong, Friend Howard. She completely understood.</p>", "3598": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I give you one simple thing to do: contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it!</p>", "3599": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What now?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have to go to the bathroom.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You just went to the bathroom.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I didn't use it because it didn't seem safe. Despite all my emails, the toilet didn't have a seatbelt.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, it still doesn't.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I realize that but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago.</p>", "3600": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm an astronaut and you know it. You just don't like admitting it because you're jealous.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, truth be told, as a child I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because it made me realize they'll just send anyone up there.</br></p>", "3601": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hello, Emily.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy. Let me ask you something: would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say \"Hey, dew-kissed flower. What's up?\".<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> No, but a weird guy with no boundaries might.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, that's a separate issue. Let's put a pin that and just focus on the passive thing.</p>", "3602": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Not my best first date, but not my worst either.</p>", "3603": "<p><strong>In-flight Announcement:</strong> The Captain has turned off the fasten seatbelt sign. You're now free to move about the cabin.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's over.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Should we stop holding hands now?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In a minute.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, good.</p>", "3604": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Ha ha, very funny. Make fun of the foreign guy. For your information, there are four times as many Indians as Americans so the way we say it is right.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Say what?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> \"Moose-stache\".</p>", "3605": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, is this really worth it? We've lived together for years without ne'ery an argument, but we start talking about a table and suddenly we're at each other's throats.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ne'ery an argument?! Ne'ery!?!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That means not one or not any. Maybe instead of a table you should buy a dictionary.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (To himself) Well, I don't know whether I won that but at least he's upset.</p>", "3606": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> This (wand remote control) might be my second favorite brown magic wand.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, that's the last time I play with that.</p>", "3607": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I just want you to know I'm happy to look in on Bernadette while you're gone.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And if anything were to happen to you, we will name our first born son Howard. I'm just kidding, we'll name him Daleep after my grandfather.<br/></p>", "3608": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have spent years turning this lump of clay in to an acceptable conduit for my will. Then you came along and reshaped him with your new fangled ideas and fancy genitals.</p>", "3609": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're too close to it, but Amy has had a huge impact on your life.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're right. Without realizing it, I have allowed that women to alter my personality.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, you didn't have a personality. You just had some shows you liked.</p>", "3610": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, you've opened my eyes to the truth. Amy has made me a more affectionate, open-minded person. And that stops now.</p>", "3611": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> He knew as your girlfriend I wasn't going to let him bring a table in to your apartment. I mean, a table? Come on!</p>", "3612": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Should we take this little party to the bedroom?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We don't have to. We have the whole place to ourselves.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's true.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> In fact, if you want, we can do it right here on Sheldon's spot.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That is the least sexy thing anyone's ever said to me.</p>", "3613": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How many trains have you been on?<br/><strong>Eric:</strong> Tons. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wow. Your life's amazing.<br/><strong>Eric:</strong> Not always. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.</p>", "3614": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I told you, buying scalped tickets is against the rules. If you get caught you get banned for life. Life, Leonard. You're going to feel pretty silly when we're eighty years old and you have to drive me down there and sit in the car for three days.</p>", "3615": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks this is a waste of time.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not true. Wil thinks this is a great idea. He was just concerned he wasn't a big enough celebrity to headline such an event. Also it's the same day he shampoos his beard.</br></p>", "3616": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, I need you to call Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy and Bill Nye the Science Guy. Because legally I'm not allowed to. And also Carrie Fisher, because I hear she's a little nuts.</p>", "3617": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Gentlemen, I am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape?</p>", "3618": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't think that will be necessary for Mr. James Earl Jones. You heard me. The voice of Darth Vader, The Lion King's dad and, FYI, the guy who says \"This is CNN\" - who also sounds like Darth Vader.</p>", "3619": "<p><strong>James Earl Jones:</strong> I say let's go have some fun. My wife's in New York and I got a Lion King residual check burning a hole in my pocket.</p>", "3620": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My friends and I couldn't get into Comic-Con this year, and I was trying to start my own convention, and I was going to ask if you'd be a panelist.<br/><strong>James Earl Jones:</strong>  Why don't you and your friends come to Comic-Con with me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>James Earl Jones:</strong>  Of course. And San Diego is straight across the border from my favorite city on earth, TIJUANA! Where I'm taking you every night!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ay-ay-ay.<br/><strong>James Earl Jones:</strong> Ay-ay-ay bang bang!</p>", "3621": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> You know what, uh, geologists and Bon Jovi have in common?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're both into rock?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Yeah.</p>", "3622": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, if you want to break up just say it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard ...<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I take it back, don't say. Just hate me but stay wiht me. It worked for my parents.</p>", "3623": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> You know what geologists and Bon Jovi have in common?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> They're both into rock?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Yeah.<br/></p>", "3624": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Do you support this?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Of course I do. She's a great actress. I'm proud she's taking this risk.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's nice.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You bought that!? Great! I gotta call her before I forget how I said it.</p>", "3625": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When I decided I was going to be a physicist, I didn't take some other job in case it didn't work. Which wasn't easy, because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson to be chalk monitor that year.</p>", "3626": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> This is awkward. You thought I was going to ask you to go with me to the rock and mineral show.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Weren't you?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Yeah.</p>", "3627": "<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> Hey, Stuart. I haven't seen you in forever. Look how grey you've gotten.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> My hair's exactly the same color as always.<br/><strong>Jesse:</strong> No, I was talking about your skin.</p>", "3628": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Mineral and rock show? That would be awful even without Bert.</p>", "3629": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So we tell him she's a lesbian?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Of course we tell him she's a lesbian.</p>", "3630": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Thanks for coming to the mineral and rock show with me.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> We're sorry Amy didn't want to go.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really, really sorry.</br></p>", "3631": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> This is nice that we all get to eat together.<br/><strong>The guys:</strong> Oh yeah, absolutely.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Can we maybe put the phones down and have an actual human conversation?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We can, but thanks to Steve Jobs we don't have to.</p>", "3632": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So it's just flirting?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, why?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No reason, I just think it's sexier when things are left to the imagination.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (to Sheldon) He's wrong.</p>", "3633": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> If you're initimated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You mean like fatties and uggos?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Or maybe just stop talking.</p>", "3634": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I never told you about my brother's kidney stones. Do you want hear about everything that comes out of my family's genitals?</p>", "3635": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hello. Oh good, I'm glad you guys didn't wait for me to start. Although you said seven and it's seven. It's fine!</p>", "3636": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Sheldon Lee Cooper, you get back in this room right now. And bring a mop!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did you hear that? A mop! I've got two PHDs yet somehow I'm the janitor of my sister's birth canal.</p>", "3637": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Aw, babe, I peed myself.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Me, too.</p>", "3638": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Well not everybody felt that way. A lot of people really hated the character and some of them hated me because of it. I would do interviews and people would be mean to me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That just happened to me. Next time you're stuck for a tweet, feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.</p>", "3639": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> *On the phone with President Siebert* For your information, I have nine friends. Ten if we include you. ... Nine it is.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's ten. I'll count Wolowitz.</p>", "3640": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> There he is! It's my favorite superhero, The Retractor.</p>", "3641": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Cooper, maybe physics just isn't your thing. Have you ever considered a career in retail? Then you could take things back for a living.</p>", "3642": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This day just keeps on getting worse and worse.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, if it makes you feel any better ...<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It probably won't.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're probably right.</p>", "3643": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> To really understand the story here, we need to start at the very beginning. A small town in East Texas where a young genuis named -<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> - Sheldon!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, that's right, Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbor's dog, leading to his first scientific break through: the Doggy Death Ray. Which sadly he couldn't build because Santa wouldn't bring him enriched uranium.</p>", "3644": "<p><strong>Ira Flatow:</strong> You know, I'd really like to hear from Dr. Hofstadter if it's all right with you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me.<br/><strong>Ira Flatow:</strong> Actually, I didn't invite you. You came in, you took a seat, and I'm not comfortable with confrontation.</p>", "3645": "<p><strong>Ira Flatow:</strong>  Some people in the science community are calling it the wonder blunder.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who? Give my their names! I bet it's Wolowitz.</br></p>", "3646": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, I'd be a physicist with a Nobel Prize in chemistry. Everyone laugh at the circus freak.</p>", "3647": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Here comes the Embarrassment Express. It stops at Fraudville, Wonder-Blunder-Berg and Kansas City, because it's a hub.</p>", "3648": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> *knocks* Sheldon, can I come in?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you have cookies?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good, because I don't deserve cookies. Come in.</p>", "3649": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse. So, I'd love to but unfortunately that sounds awful.</p>", "3650": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> My mom's been to Arizona. She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon. Long story short: they had to shoot it.<br/>\n*Blank look from Bernadette's father*<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> ... because she's so fat.<br/>\n*door rings*<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'll get the door while you finish laughing.</p>", "3651": "<p><strong>Mike:</strong> How do you not make a first down there?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They passed against a nickel defense. They should have run it off tackle.<br/><strong>Mike:</strong> How the hell do you know that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My father loved football. He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework.</p>", "3652": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So when you say you're not going to flip out about the DVD, here's what that means. Don't fixate on it, or wake me up in the middle of the night, or nag me through the door while I'm on the toilet.</p>", "3653": "<p><strong>Lucy:</strong> I'm kinda seeing someone.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I think I know the answer to this, but just to be clear. It's not me, right?</p>", "3654": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I've never seen him (Sheldon) this happy before.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's because you've never seen him on \"Restock the Medicine Cabinet\" day.</p>", "3655": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  Oh, right. I remember your girlfriend. *Looking around* Is she here?<br/></p>", "3656": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And to think I idolized that man.  And why? At the end of the day, he's just another Hollywood phoney.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Is it really worth getting upset about?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They say don't meet your heroes. Don't peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity. Because if you do, you'll see them as they really are: degenerate carnival folk.</p>", "3657": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> There are just some things I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls. Because they won't make fun of me, or call me names, or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch.</p>", "3658": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> (To Penny) So, you have any single grandmothers?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sorry, they're both married.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  Good. .... Happily?</p>", "3659": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> (To Raj) Will you play the ukelele?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sure, I'd be happy to shred it on my axe.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Or you could just play your tiny, ridiculous guitar.</p>", "3660": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I've always had this fantasy that involves dancing. The sexual chemistry between my partner and me. But boy oh boy, does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, that's just the plot for \"Dirty Dancing\".</br></p>", "3661": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't call anyone a whore, and the only time I use the phrase \"my bitch\", I'm referring to you (Howard).</p>", "3662": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did you know that Los Angeles has a little Sri Lanka?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I did not.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I do now. They're a lovely people, although terrifying when you wake up face to face with them.</p>", "3663": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, let's try it again. But this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesn't want to hurt you.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I don't think I can give you that.</p>", "3664": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Attention all shoppers, my business is open for business!</p>", "3665": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Bernadette told me everything. Now you don't get the left or the right.</p>", "3666": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? The only time I'm ever picked first for a team and I'm stuck with the liability?</p>", "3667": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. I guess that story's more sad than funny.</p>", "3668": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Faster, faster, faster! Do you not know that word? It means more fast!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Stop yelling at me.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, you'll know when I'm yelling at you.</p>", "3669": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you think Penny's mad at me?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Because you're in the right lane behind a bus and you won't go around it? I'm sure she finds it charming.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, because I didn't want her on my team.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm starting to think she dodged a bullet. The slowest bullet in the world.</p>", "3670": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, Romeo. Repair your relationship on your own time!</p>", "3671": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> This man (Raj), held my breast the other day and I love him for it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> A little loud, dude.</p>", "3672": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, it's your lucky day. Three of these eggs are clearly not jumbo size. Grab your keys!</p>", "3673": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Stuart, I was wondering if you can help me find something.<br/>\nStuart: Happy to, unless it's hope or a reason to live? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown.</p>", "3674": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aquaman? This isn't a gag gift, Stuart.</p>", "3675": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No I should apologize. I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> That is not fair. I complain  about what a burden it is at least once a month.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, no, no. Let's not sugarcoat this. You find me finnicky, pedantic and annoying.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, he doesn't.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I have actually used those exact words before. In that order.</br></p>", "3676": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm definitely up a cup size.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, but they're firm. So you've got that going for you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thanks, I needed that today.</p>", "3677": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I own nine pairs of pants.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, that's a good start. But I was thinking something a bit more personal.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, okay. I own nine pairs of underpants.</p>", "3678": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> If I were hitting on you, you would know it because you would be feeling uncomfortable and a little sad for me.</p>", "3679": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, it's not a great time. What do you want?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (on the phone in the apartment) Hello to you, too. I'm sorry, but this is important.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What is it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case, and Back to the Future III was, get this, in the Back to the Future II case.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an intruder?</p>", "3680": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What's the matter?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind you'd get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> To be honest, I did.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aww.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case. Leonard did it.</p>", "3681": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Dear Lord, you're an astronomer. Although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. Gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Is that true?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Everything I say is true. Now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating feces, living in feces and making little balls out of feces, so, you know, pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace.</p>", "3682": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Why don't you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You overestimate his significance in my life. Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? No. Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? I don't think so. Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code? (taps out \"no\" in morse code)</p>", "3683": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> By the way, how are you with zippers?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I really need to go to the bathroom, and this ones gone all cattywampus.</p>", "3684": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, look, here's something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A., I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh, after I did it, I felt so ashamed. Thankfully, that thing never came out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've seen that. Yeah. \"Serial Apeist\". Howard found it online the day we met you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, God.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. </p>", "3685": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It did not kill me when you went to space. Monkeys went to space.</p>", "3686": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> If you wear something brown and sit on the couch, they won't even know you're there.</p>", "3687": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, you're being selfish. We need to give you a proper send-off so we'll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face.</p>", "3688": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now, Penny, we don't consume alcohol during Dungeons and Dragons. It impairs our judgment.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, this isn't alcohol. It's a magic potion that makes me like you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Double potion, please.</p>", "3689": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know it doesn't seem like it to you, but for me what we have is extremely intimate.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I guess I know that. It's just part of me wants more.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> More? I mean, look at us. It's only been three years, here we are in bed together.</p>", "3690": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> How'd you get him to come to your house?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you can't solve if you use your noggin.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And he wrote him a check.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, that too. A big check.</br></p>", "3691": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Professor Proton hosted my favorite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It was pretty cool.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aw, it's so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasgetti.</p>", "3692": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> I'll give you a hint. I have a bracelet with my own address on it.</p>", "3693": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> If they didn't want to be yelled at by crazy nerds they shouldn't have started the Syfy channel.</p>", "3694": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They can't just cancel a show like Alpha, you know. They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season 'til we were grateful it ended.</p>", "3695": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Missed one. Now your wish can't come true.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Lucky for you because I wished you were dead.</p>", "3696": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I was Googling that girl I've been dating, and I found her blog.\n<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Cool. Anything juicy?\n<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> She said she recently went on a date with a guy named Roger? And he's Indian? And he's an astrophysicist, too?\n<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know what's going on, don't you?\n<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Mummy was right. American girls are sexually voracious devils.</p>", "3697": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I can see my little princess while I'm at work, right?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why can't you just watch porn like a normal guy?</p>", "3698": "<p><strong>Mrs. Davis:</strong> Roots? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The tragic history of slavery in America. Fun for the whole family.<br/><strong>Mrs. Davis:</strong>: Why would you think this is an appropriate gift?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Umm. Well, you are black, right?</p>", "3699": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If we really want science to advance, people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid.</p>", "3700": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That was ambiguous.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, now it's biguous.</p>", "3701": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, screw it. I'm going in.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait. Hold on. I believe screw it, I'm going in, is what I said to your mother last night.</p>", "3702": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> He's our guest. We can't just ask him to straighten our closet.</p><strong>Howard:</strong> No, we wouldn't ask him. We'd just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there.", "3703": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> The letter was found in Bernadette's closet. Doesn't that count for something? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you pointing out that California is a community property state and since Howard and Bernadette are married the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses? <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, obviously. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well played. Sometimes I don't give you enough credit, Penny. </p>", "3704": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was actually trapped by Penny and forced into reveleaing confidential information about Howard's father.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What information?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't tell you, I'm bound by closet organizer-organizee confidentiality.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Just tell us.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Badgering me won't work. What would work is saying Penny would tell us anyway.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Then that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Very well. Everyone's on their game today.</p>", "3705": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sheldon, I've been cooking all day.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, now don't you feel silly.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (To Howard) Show him the closet.</br></p>", "3706": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, aren't you going to spend a little time with Amy?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, it's okay, I'm used to it. The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an entire hour optimizing the cheese aisle.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami.</p>", "3707": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What can I do for you ladies?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You have something we want.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, dear. My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, we just want information.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. I've got that spades. Ravage me.</p>", "3708": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, surprisingly, the letter from your father wasn't the most interesting thing I read in the closet. Bernadette's diary has some saucy passages.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sheldon, don't you dare.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's nothing to worry about. Your secret's safe with me.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's more like it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.</p>", "3709": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I found three bowling pins. Do you juggle these or are you missing seven?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Juggle.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You health nuts kill me.</p>", "3710": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, all Snow White needs is one small kiss to wake up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Heard you the first time.</p>", "3711": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I guess you could say Raj is my name and stars are my game.</p>", "3712": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, stop ruining Valentine's day and order my pizza.</p>", "3713": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste.</p>", "3714": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> The theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> That's good. Or maybe something a little less hand in the pants.</p>", "3715": "<p><strong>Alex:</strong> Well, I know she loves playing the harp, so Ifound this beautiful music box that plays one of her favorite songs.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now, Amy already has a real harp and it can play any song. What are you trying to pull here?</p>", "3716": "<p><strong>Alex:</strong> I know she's a fan of The Canterbury Tales. So I found this cool map that illustrates the characters' journey through England. I thought we could put it in a really nice frame.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But she's got Google Maps on her phone.<br/><strong>Alex:</strong> I don't know how to respond to that.</p>", "3717": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It's nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine's Day can come here tonight and be together.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it. In fact, there's no place I would rather be than here.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Except on a date with anybody.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Literally anybody.</p>", "3718": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> As you know, I had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, and as you know, I planned to pretend to enjoy it. I've been working on this facial expression all day.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And I appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, I decided I was being selfish. So, I canceled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate Valentine's Day.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What is that?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> By doing none of it. No dinner, no romance, no gifts. We stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved Star War Trek things.</p>", "3719": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone's ever given me. And that's including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today.</p>", "3720": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh really, Leonard? Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, and I have a theory why. Because of your lactose intolerance, you switched over to soy milk. Soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds. I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman.</br></p>", "3721": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Then what the hell, Sheldon? We have been going out for over two years, and I have been nothing but patient with you. I watch your dopey space movies. I signed your ridiculous contract. I even stopped wearing lip gloss 'cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery. I am the best girlfriend youre ever gonna have. You give me one good reason why I can't live here.</p>", "3722": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Check this out. I took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello. This is Sheldon.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And this is Amy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We're not home right now.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> 'cause we out dropping science, son.<br/><strong>Both:</strong> Leave a message.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Beep.\n</p>", "3723": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh my God. She's not going to bathe me, is she?</p>", "3724": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> And we're blending, and we're blending, and we're done.\n<strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know Mr. Data isn't supposed to smile, but here it comes.\n<strong>Howard:</strong> (Dressed as a Borg) Come on, guys. Let's do this.\n<strong>Leonard:</strong> (dressed as Captain Picard): Yeah, I'm sweating my bald cap off.</p>", "3725": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> If Harry Potter's wand can make decisions, why can't Thor's hammer?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, if you are going to start comparing wands and hammers, I can't even take you seriously.</p>", "3726": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I did the research. Tony the Tiger, Dig'em the Frog, Cap'n Crunch, Toucan Sam, Count Chocula, Trix the Rabbit, Snap, Crackle and Pop. Not one cereal mascot is a girl. It's a total breakfast sausage fest.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are we done with this?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Almost. Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee, I believe his name is Buzz.</p>", "3727": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Who's involved?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, a short bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate. Let's call this colleague Ricardo Shilly-Shally.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're talking about Leonard.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, no, Shilly-Shally has red hair and he briefly served in the Mexican Navy.</p>", "3728": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Never heard of it. Must be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy.</p>", "3729": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> It's fine. I'm used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice. I didn't have my first kiss until I was 22. And the guy only did it so I'd give him back his insulin.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants.</p>", "3730": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fun? Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly, the best-tasting jelly, and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly.</p>", "3731": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow. Sheldon, what do you do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove Christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy.<br/></p>", "3732": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh boy, we're just married to a couple of ballbusters, huh, Mike?<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> That's my wife and daughter you're talking about.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Great couple of gals.<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> I wouldn't go that far.</p>", "3733": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So, how have you been?<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> Fine.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Good. Fine is good. How you liking retirement?<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> It's fine.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm sensing a theme.</p>", "3734": "<p><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> So, why'd you agree to come?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> 'Cause Bernadette made me.<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> I tried to back out, too. My wife said I had to go.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really? Your wife makes you do stuff? You're a big, scary cop.<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> You're an astronaut, and your wife makes you do things, and she's only four feet tall.</p>", "3735": "<p><strong><strong>Amy:</strong></strong> Well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won't be thinking about his mother. And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard's lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb.</p>", "3736": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, you brought this on yourself. Sheldon, get him.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie. However, if a mummy bites you, all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite. So, like a zombie that's been eaten from the waist down, you, sir, have no leg to stand on.</br></p>", "3737": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> More coffee?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, Leonard's taking me to a physics lecture, and coffee'll just keep me awake.</p>", "3738": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Get away from me or I swear to God I will rip out what's left of your pubes!</p>", "3739": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> He can't handle the fact that I'm a bigger deal than he is now.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, preposterous. I have been solely responsible for this university's six loop quantum gravity calculations, I have changed the way we think about Bose-Einsten condensates, and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending machine. Maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space.</p>", "3740": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, Howard's never gonna go to space again, but Sheldon will always be a genius.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're right. And, I'm sure Sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> If and when?<br/></p>", "3741": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> (Slams his car door) Will you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're both acting like lunatics!</p>", "3742": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What am I supposed to say?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Say \"Can't talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. England sucks. You suck. USA number one.\"</p>", "3743": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Wow. An end of an era.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Boy, if these walls could talk.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> They'd say, why does he touch himself so much?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah.</p>", "3744": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No husband of mine is gonna break his mother's heart!</p>", "3745": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll be right back. Feel free to play with yourself.</p>", "3746": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, I've had enough of this. I'm a grown man, I have a successful career, for the love of God, I've been to space. I will move out when I'm ready, and I don't need anyone badgering me into it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, excuse me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That was just for her benefit. I'll move tomorrow. I love you. Don't leave me.</p>", "3747": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay. You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, I guess. Hey, would you do me a favor? Go on ahead. I just want one last moment alone in my old room.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We're not standing outside by the U-Haul while you fondle yourself.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine, let's go.</p>", "3748": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy deserves better. You know, when we buy the Planter's deluxe mix, she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don't have to look at them. She's a unique blend of saint and squirrel.</p>", "3749": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ooh, now that is a treat that's hard to beat.  Get the Mad Hatter on the horn.  I'm having a tea party!</p>", "3750": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> *knock knock knock* Amy.\n<br>\n*knock knock knock* Amy\n<br/>\n*knock knock knock* Angry Amy.\n</br></p>", "3751": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Eat one of your Luna bars.  Very often when women think they're angry, they're really just hungry.</p>", "3752": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Someday scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle.</p>", "3753": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny started taking a class. She wrote a paper, she didn't want me to read it, I went behind her back and I read it anyway.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Stephen Hawking hates me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know what to do. I mean, the paper's terrible. But if I tell her, she'll know that I read it and she'll get really mad.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was beating him so bad, he doesn't want to be friends anymore. Why does everyone love me except Stephen Hawking?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is it possible we're having two different conversations?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How would I know? I'm not listening to you.</p>", "3754": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Leonard does things he doesn't like to make you happy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, yeah he's my boyfriend, isn't that like his job?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Then what's your job?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Letting him make me happy.</p>", "3755": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you familiar with the Higgs boson?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Of course, it is - it's been in the news. And it's a very famous boson.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nice try.</p>", "3756": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon told me he had a new assistant named Alex. He didn't mention that Alex was a girl.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Maybe he didn't notice.</p>", "3757": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend. Im a big fan of homeostasis. Do you know what that is?\n<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Of course not.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Homeostasis refers to a systems ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH.\n<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Worst bedtime story ever!</p>", "3758": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> When I get married, I'm going to register at the UCLA Cadaver Lab.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Eww, why?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> 'cause I've always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy.</p>", "3759": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How can she not be sure how she feels? You know, when I have a feeling, I know it. Trains? Love them. Swordfish. I love them, too. They're fish with a sword for a nose.</p>", "3760": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, Stuart.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Yeah?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Do you want to hang out tomorrow night, maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Yeah, I'd like to, but I'm a little tight on funds.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No problem. My treat. I'll swing by after work.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay.<br/>\n(After Raj leaves)<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I could do worse.</p>", "3761": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I can't believe I bleached my moustache for this.</p>", "3762": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I got all your favorites. Beer, wings, sliders. We can watch the football game. I even painted my stomach.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Go Sports?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, in case you were in the mood for football, I didn't want to look ridiculous.</p>", "3763": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Have I ever told you you're like a sexy praying mantis?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Every time you drink alcohol.</p>", "3764": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I love his eidetic memory, it's so sexy. Sheldon, what are the ingredients in Pringles?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Dried potatoes, vegetable oil, corn flour, wheat starch, maltodextrin, salt, and my favorite ingredient of all, uniformity.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> The uterus quivers, does it not?</p>", "3765": "<p><strong>Mr. Rostenkowski:</strong> Here you go.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> \"Here you go?\" What am I, a football?<br/><strong>Mr. Rostenkowski:</strong> Like that guy could catch a football.</br></p>", "3766": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For example, this morning I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum, when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy's dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders. Oh, what has that vixen done to me, Leonard? And how do I make it stop?</p>", "3767": "<p><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> Last murder case before I retired. How many bodies do you see there? Careful, i's a trick question.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Im not sure.<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> Nah, you'll never get it. It's a fraction.</p>", "3768": "<p><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> When I first met you, I didn't like you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm aware of that, sir.<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> But then you and I had some time together.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Uh-huh.<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> It did not get better.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Right, right.<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> That silly Beatle haircut and you riding around on a red Vespa, and you still living at home with your mother. To be honest, I thought Bernadette chose you to punish me. But then I heard about your astronaut thing, and I realized I judged you too fast. Maybe you are the right guy for my little girl.</p>", "3769": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Anyway, if it's okay with you, we should talk about Howard's bachelor party.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, youre half swan.\n</p>", "3770": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Nobody cares, Hofstadter. Wrap it up.</p>", "3771": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As is the tradition, I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humor at Howard's expense. Prepare to have your ribs tickled.<br/>\nHoward, I always thought you'd be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right?<br/>\nLet's see here. Oh, seriously though, Howard, you're actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And that's a zinger, because you're not.<br/>\nI've always thought that you'd make someone a fine husband someday. Assuming you'd be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which I don't see as likely. Ha-cha!<br/>\nOkay, let me see here. Okay, kidding aside, Howard, you are a good friend. And I wish you nothing but happiness. Bazinga, I don't!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon...<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Double-zinga! I do!<br/>\nGood luck following that.</p>", "3772": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> See, there it is, there's that twinkle.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I can't help it. That's an involuntary twinkle.</p>", "3773": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Well, if you're not coming out, why did you call us during the cricket semi-finals?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> 'Cause I, I'm tired of trying to meet someone and, I think I'd like you to help me find uh, a wife.<br/><strong>Mrs. Koothrappali:</strong> And just to clarify, a female wife?</p>", "3774": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe she'll dig it. Women like a firm hand on the tiller.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I can never find the tiller. I got a book, it didn't help.</p>", "3775": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How do I get him to treat me better?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101. Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex, but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty. So, I'd say give him the silent treatment.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, he loves that.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hmm.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Our record for sitting in a room together and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours. He said it was a magical evening.</p>", "3776": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, what just happened?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot, I'm guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug, and changed the course of human events.</p>", "3777": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> On the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Oh, you are going down, Cooper.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't think so, Kripke. I've bounced many a rubber ball in my day.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, that's enough trash talk. One, two, three.</p>", "3778": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Yelling at a mockingbird)  And you, the notes are C, D, E, G and A! You pick one or I'm chopping down that tree!</p>", "3779": "<p><strong><strong>Bernadette:</strong></strong> Goodnight, real Penny. Goodnight, transvestite Penny.</p>", "3780": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This place could really use a suggestion box.</p>", "3781": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Why do you put six sugars in your coffee?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because the cafeteria doesn't offer little packets of methamphetamine.</br></p>", "3782": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> No, your Reebok has a gunshot wound and you have an ouchie on your pinky toe.</p>", "3783": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Listen to me. Not westauwant, westauwant. See, total cwap. You suck, Siwi!</p>", "3784": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now, back to our game.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You were in the middle of an erection.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, of course. It's right here in my hand.\n</p>", "3785": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. When I was five, Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> How is that not amusing?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's still there. Takes me forty-fives minutes to get through airport security.</br></br></p>", "3786": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> The thing is, my mother worked full-time. I had to take care of my brothers and sisters.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, so?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Ugh, it was horrible. With their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. I don't want to get dressed. Joey keeps spitting in my mouth. This isn't the way Mom makes waffles. Well, okay, put your hand in here. Let's see how you like this waffle!</p>", "3787": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't think I can meet the girl who was always mean to me. Tammy Bodnick. One time, while I was in gym class, she stole all my clothes and left an elf costume in my locker.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's awful.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Worst part was, it was too big.</p>", "3788": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You are soft. The world is going to chew you up and spit you out.</p>", "3789": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> (To sheldon) Hey, cuddles.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Cuddles?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, \"cuddles\". We cuddled. Grow up, Leonard. </p>", "3790": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> If you're worried, we can go over there and see if she's all right.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. You know, I heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighborhood.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local news item. Now, thanks to you, I'm worried Amy's been eaten by a bobcat.</p>", "3791": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It would mean so much if you would be the maid of honor at my wedding.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What? Wait is this some kind of practical joke? Like in Norway when my \"friends\" trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?</p>", "3792": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> It's called the Born Again Boat Ride. Christian Quarterly gave it their highest rating: five thorny crowns.</p>", "3793": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> This is exciting. Back home, the diner on Route 4 serves sushi. But it's just cut up fish sticks and a side of Uncle Ben's. They put it on the menu in those Kung Fu letters but that don't make it sushi.</p>", "3794": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Kung Fu letters might not be politically correct.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh, I thought the one we couldn't say was Ching-Chong.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, that too.</p>", "3795": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> How are you doing on the young lady front? I hear you're in some sort of a long distance situation.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, yeah. It's Raj's sister. It's kinda tough. She's in India and also her parents aren't happy she's dating someone white.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh, that's a funny turn, isn't it? You never think about it going the other way.</br></p>", "3796": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm glad we're finally getting to do something together. Just the two of us.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Sure. One thing you really miss when you're on vacation is laundry.</p>", "3797": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> The trick to pancakes is bacon grease. I cook everything in it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Everything? Aren't you worried about your health?<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh, doctors are always changing their minds. One week bacon grease is bad for you. The next week we're not getting enough of it.</p>", "3798": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh, this one's sweet. You know, for your rosary rattlers.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mrs Cooper, we say Catholics, not rosary rattlers.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> My goodness. It's a wonder you people in California can talk at all.</p>", "3799": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> Over my dead body my son goes into outer space. </p>", "3800": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, great, more guys. It's gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage-fest.</p>", "3801": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> See, as you know, a few years ago I achieve one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. Well, from time to time, I notarize banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis aren't just rich. They're Richie Rich rich.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, so how much is that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.</p>", "3802": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I have some work to do, so-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I can't imagine that would disturb me. Carry on.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay. Wouldn't you be more comfortable at home?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Not really, no.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> All righty then. Guess I'll just get started.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Leonard, please. I don't need the running commentary.</p>", "3803": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I just can't figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> The hokey pokey is a young man's game.</p>", "3804": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> When you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, the virtual pickle tickle. The digital bow-chacka-bow-wow.</p>", "3805": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Come on dude, that's my sister you're talking about.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it.</p>", "3806": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've been sitting in garbage!</p>", "3807": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> We heard there was a tornado in Kansas City, is that close to you?<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> No.</p>", "3808": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Zandor, wizard of the north. Ha! I win!<br><strong>Howard:</strong> If you skip the part about under a two week quarantine because you were exposed to a deadly disease, absolutely.</br></p>", "3809": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I can't do this any more! I'm a good girl. I went to Catholic school!</p>", "3810": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A girls night? Oh, I don't know if I'm up for an evening talking rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps.</p>", "3811": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance. I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate.</p>", "3812": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, thank you. But for the record, I'm an excellent dancer. Proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't see why that's surprising. I excel at so many things. You've had my sourdough bread.</br></p>", "3813": "<p><strong>Mrs. Koothrappali:</strong> Please tell me you're not dating an American. I knew this would happen. Rajesh, are you letting your sister date that little Howard boy?</p>", "3814": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, Raj, wanna see a new magic trick I've been working on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard, if I may interject here with a piece of friendly advice. Is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time? Granted, you're just an engineer, but that doesn't mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else's Nobel prize acceptance speech.</p>", "3815": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, now hold on, how about this? How about we still hang out, but on the down-low?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you really that kind of guy?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low.</p>", "3816": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, well, I'm happy Leonard's found someone. Not that anybody asked.</p>", "3817": "<p><strong>Priya:</strong> It's a little weird your ex-girlfriend hanging out here all the time.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know. I usually never see my ex-girlfriends, unless their hard drives crash.</p>", "3818": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Pick a card, Sheldon. Now look at it and put it back in the deck. Now do you remember your card? Of course I do, I have an eidetic memory.</p>", "3819": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hypothetically, if I had access to a lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> Leonard, it is a source of great pain to me and my family that my brother has that outfit in his wardrobe.</p>", "3820": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Okay, I'm ready. I'm Zack, and I'm, uh ... oh, crap, why is this so hard?</p>", "3821": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> So, long story short, I nailed her.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When he finished, he shouted Eureka!<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> No, I always shout, Holy Moly! Don't know why. Just do.</br></p>", "3822": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> It seems like the appropriate thing to do when one's best friend finds herself replaced by a smart, beautiful woman with the smouldering sexuality of a crouched Bengal tiger.</p>", "3823": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, it's Saturday night. You'll be doing laundry.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't tell him that. Tell him the mask thing.</p>", "3824": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, like it or not, until you manage to upload your intelligence into a self-sustaining orbiting satellite, equipped with high-speed Internet and a cloaking device, you will be dependent on other members of the human race.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's it. Prepare to be minimized.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm not finished. All scientists have to fund-raise, Sheldon. How do you think I paid for my lab?<br/>\nI went to Saudi Arabia and met with a prince who had an interest in neurobiology.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Technically, Faisal is my fiance. But I do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in Riyadh for the winter.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your Facebook page.</p>", "3825": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm, no. One slip of the hand and suddenly I'm sitting in the Engineering Department, building doodads with Wolowitz.</br></p>", "3826": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm still not adjusted to how the SyFy channel spells their name now. S-Y-F-Y, that's siffy.</p>", "3827": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So is the McRib sandwich. I don't care for that either.</p>", "3828": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Action.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, it's not a movie. It's improv. So no one calls action.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, you taught me something. Who would have thought that.</p>", "3829": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Playing the theremin.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. I mean, what are you doing with a theremin?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Playing it.</p>", "3830": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've loved the theremin from the first moment I heard the original Star Trek theme. And it's been killing me that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, we're working here!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's all right. I can barely hear you over my theremin. (Leonard pulls the plug) Well, that was a little uncalled for.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, that was completely called for. We need quiet.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, your project is more important than mine?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Dont beat around the bush, Leonard. If you dont want me here, just say the word, and Ill leave.<br/>\n(cut to Sheldon in the hallway outside the apartment)<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Could have beaten around the bush a little.</p>", "3831": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> I haven't been to a comic book store in literally a million years.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Literally? Literally a million years? </p>", "3832": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Look up in the sky. It's a bird. It's a plane. I forget the rest.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All right. Let's get this thing over with.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry. But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Relax. No one's going to be looking at her hair. Ow! I mean, ow.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Hold on. The costume came with a black wig. Where is it, babe?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No. I'm not wearing it. It looks stupid.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Come on. We're trying to win a contest here.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Forget it. I'm not wearing the wig.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Penny, there's no I in Justice League.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, actually.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't. He's making our case.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Okay, babe. You're kind of embarrassing me in front of my friends.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I'm not going.</p>", "3833": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Look up in the sky. Its a bird. Its a plane. I forget the rest.</p>", "3834": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> If you die and donate your body to science, I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon.</p>", "3835": "<p>Zack: Hey, Penny, how's it going?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?<br/>\nZack: My dad's company prints the menus for this place. I'm just dropping off some new ones, laminated. Makes 'em easier to clean if people throw up on 'em. Guess how I got the idea?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I got it, I got it.</p>", "3836": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> My gluteus what?</p>", "3837": "<p><strong>Wyatt:</strong> I thought we were past the days when you would try to pull the wool over my eyes. Telling me the baggie in your underwear drawer is potpourri? And the pee stick in your bathroom is to check for diabetes?</p>", "3838": "<p><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Please, please, please don't give up on her.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> I can't go back to the skateboard idiots, the white rappers and all those sweaty dumb-asses with their backwards hats.</p>", "3839": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, I hope they let us in soon. I'm tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom. The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time. It's a vicious circle.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Too bad you don't have a stadium pal like me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's a stadium pal?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Let me put it this way. Takes care of the bathroom problem and it keeps your calf warm.</p>", "3840": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now to business. Eighteen years ago, I sent the FBI Crime Lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch for fingerprinting and DNA analysis. Why haven't I heard back yet?<br><strong>Agent Page:</strong> Well, the FBI Crime Lab does have a lot on its plate.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning faeces off its shoes.</br></p>", "3841": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard, the person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, but before you get upset, I want you to know I went to the FBI and retracted my statement.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And they were okay with that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. If anything, I made it worse.</p>", "3842": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you like trains?<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> Not particularly.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.</p>", "3843": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howard, a girl doesn't go out with a man like you, with your looks, your fancy patter, and your tight hoochie pants if she's not expecting him to eventually make the move.</p>", "3844": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're wrong again. If arrogance were my super power, my name would be Dr. Arroganto.</p>", "3845": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> I think it shrunk. I'm spilling out like the Pillsbury Doughboy here.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And with that mental picture, I think we're done for the evening.</p>", "3846": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, she's real.<br><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Did they sin?</br></p>", "3847": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Well, well. That's a powerful smell.</p>", "3848": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> You should have called sooner.</p>", "3849": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Shelly, dinner's ready.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Coming.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> No cats!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aww.</p>", "3850": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Now, the reason I called Amy over was to find out what kind of person she is. Now, after chatting a bit, I have to say that while she is a perfectly ... unique ... young woman, you two are definitely not suited for each other.</p>", "3851": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Well, putting aside the pig Latin. It's a good a thing you two decided to end the relationship so I didn't have to end it for you.</p>", "3852": "<p><strong>Sheldon Cooper:</strong> You're my 15th favorite technological visionary. <br/><br><strong>Steve Wozniak:</strong> Only 15th? <br/><br><strong>Sheldon Cooper:</strong> It's still 6 spots above Steve Jobs. I care neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship.<br/><br><strong>Steve Wozniak:</strong> Yeah, I never got that turtleneck thing. <br/><br><strong>Sheldon Cooper:</strong> One of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977 Apple. Despite the file system limitations of Apple DOS 3.3, it was a pretty nifty little achievement.<br/><br><strong>Steve Wozniak:</strong> Thanks. We were shooting for nifty. You know if you had it here I'd autograph it for you.<br/><br><strong>Sheldon Cooper:</strong> Don't move for 15 to 30 minutes depending on how the buses are running.<br/><br><strong>Steve Wozniak:</strong> (To his wife) Nerds! <br/><br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>", "3853": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you mean it happened again?!</p>", "3854": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> That's amazing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I wouldn't say amazing. At best it's a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, Sheldon? Ahem.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes?<br/>\n*Howard commands the robot arm to perform a hand gesture*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Peace?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, not peace. Hang on.</p>", "3855": "<p><strong>Amy Farrah Fowler (text message)</strong>: I don't care for perchloroethylene, and I don't like glycol ether.</p>", "3856": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know what, go to Hell and set their thermostat.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't have to go to Hell. At 73 degrees, I'm already there.</br></p>", "3857": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, sleep night. I mean, obviously, good night. I started to say sleep tight then I changed my mind in the middle. I swear to God, I'm smart.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Get it together, man.</p>", "3858": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Go Team Leonard!</p>", "3859": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am the proud owner of WilWheatonStinks.com, .net and .org!.What does that tell you?<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> It tells me that I am living rent free, right here (points to Sheldon's head).</p>", "3860": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> This isn't fair to you, Leonard. I'm sorry. *runs off*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, wait, come back. I'll get you ice cream!</p>", "3861": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Give us the precious!</p>", "3862": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Ow. Damn, paper cut. Nothing worse than a paper cut.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, obviously you don't remember your circumcision.</p>", "3863": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ill tell you where I've been. You boys may have had gelato with Stan Lee and gotten autographed comics, but I saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sweet.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Plus, I get to hang out with him again at the hearing. This is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy.</p>", "3864": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, well, I've been dreaming about spending Valentine's Day with a girl since I was six.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Shame on you! That's no dream for a scientist.</p>", "3865": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Have you tried rebooting him?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I think it's a firmware problem.</p>", "3866": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So you're going to work at the patent office?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't be absurd. That's in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern.</p>", "3867": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I asked myself what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind. Toll both attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don't like touching other people's coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am.</p>", "3868": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. What is mobster sauce?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's obviously a typo.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perhaps. Pehraps this restaurant's now a front for organized crime. For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, no, no, no. I think it jut means it's the kind of sauce that mobsters like.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It doesn't mean any of that. It's a typo!</p>", "3869": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, the more I think about it, the mobster sauce couldn't possible contain chunks of mobster.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And why is that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It was listed under sea food.</p>", "3870": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm lactose intolerant.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And you don't wish to alarm me with any more loud noises. Very thoughtful.</br></p>", "3871": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> It's all right, Sheldon. I will just pretend Leonard's not withholding information. Although, I will point out, Leonard, that I am a trained psychiatrist and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioral ticks that accompanied you learning to masturbate.</p>", "3872": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Speaking of fathers, Leonard, I'm divorcing yours.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Yes, he was cheating on me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Yes. With some waitress from the university cafeteria. Can you believe it? A waitress! Oh, no offense dear!</p>", "3873": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Excuse me, Leonard. I'm the one getting a divorce, Mitsy's dead, why are you the one making a fuss?</p>", "3874": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I've been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yikes.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> *laughs*<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What's so funny?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> That's exactly what I say during orgasms: \"yikes\".</p>", "3875": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> How did his penis turn out?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, Beverly. I can't talk to my boyfriend's mother about his penis.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Fair enough. What, if anything, can you tell me about that busboy's penis?</p>", "3876": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, fig newtons are named after the town in Massachusetts, not the scientist. Hey, don't write that down.</p>", "3877": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Senior fitness was cancelled. It turns out you can forget how to ride a bike. I'm fine, but, oy, did Sam Harpoolian eat gravel.<br/><strong><strong>Howard:</strong></strong> That's great, Ma!<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong></p>", "3878": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Let me ask you a question. At what point did National Public Radio have to start scraping the bottom of the barrel for its guest? Don't answer, it's rhetorical.</p>", "3879": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.</p>", "3880": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I can't read your mind, Penny!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? Why not? You're so smart, and I'm so dumb.</p>", "3881": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> How come I wasn't part of this deal?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You had left the refreshment stand in prder to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> So, that's how it works? I have a teeny bladder and I don't get a hot girlfriend.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, Raj, that's how it works.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Damn!</p>", "3882": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal Wrath of Khan: \"He tasks me, he tasks me and I shall have him.\"<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No doubt!

Shiksa.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Forgive me, Yiddish was not spoken in East Texas, and if it was, it wasn't spoken for long.</p>", "3885": "<p><strong>Crawley:</strong> Ha-ha. Don't knock, just walk in. Why be polite to the world's leading expert on the dung beetle?</p>", "3886": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Could you look at Toby?<br/><strong>Crawley:</strong> Toby? What a stupid name for a cricket.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (To Howard) Told you.</p>", "3887": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Attention, everyone. I'm Sheldon Cooper. As those of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour.<br><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Off a cliff.</br></p>", "3888": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> If you recall, when you were little we sat right here at this very spot and talked about some of the problems you had getting along with the neighbor kids.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that's why they hated me.<br><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh, baby. They knew very well why they hated you.</br></br></p>", "3889": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> There's no alcohol in this household. Stop talking like that. And lose the hat.</p>", "3890": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory, we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program.</p>", "3891": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> (Answering phone) You've reached \"Friends with Benefits\", for a booty call, press 1 now.</p>", "3892": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would you like some advice?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure, why not?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Then this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Gee, thanks a lot.</p>", "3893": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'll take the apartment upstairs. I can finally get away from my mother, and we can spend some more time together, if you catch my drift.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> The horror.</p>", "3894": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The horror!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, Im sure it's going to be fine.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, it's not going to be fine, change is never fine. They say it is, but it's not.</p>", "3895": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, are you familiar with the development that resulted from Honore Blanc's 1778 use of interchangeable parts? The assembly line, of course.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, you know what, if I'm not allowed to be snide, you're not allowed to be condescending.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That wasn't a part of our original agreement, and I do not agree to it now.\n<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?<br/><strong.sheldon:< strong=\"\"> Youre thinking of the moving assembly line, an understandable but not excusable mistake. No, the moving assembly line, that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908. That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods.

I now need you to acknoweldge receipt of the package so I'm fully indemnified and no longer liable.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, it's just a box of rhinestones.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, the content are irrelevant. A legal bailment has been created. Does that mean nothing to you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It means nothing to anybody.</p>", "3897": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> There, nice and comfy cosy. Zero, zero, zero.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sit on the damn couch.</p>", "3898": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> You know, both selective mutism and an inability to separate from one's mother can stem from a pathological fear of women. It might explain why the two of you have created an ersatz homosexual marriage to satisfy your need for intimacy.</p>", "3899": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You must be Leonard's mother.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Well, I don't know whether I must be, but yes.</p>", "3900": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. The rest is divvied up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut brittle, and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. Or her own protection.</p>", "3901": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Kripke, what would you say to the idea of you and I becoming friends?<br><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> I would say \"I have no interest in becoming your friend\".</br></p>", "3902": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What did the toaster oven ever do to you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What did I do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade? He still punched me in the face with my own fists. Sorry, you little nerd. You were just in the wrong boys' room at the wrong time.</p>", "3903": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Gather around, kids. It's time for Sheldon's beloved Christmas special.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In the pre-Christian era, as the winter solstice approached and the plants died, pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic, intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring. This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And that, Charlie Brown, is what boredom is all about.</br></p>", "3904": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't feel bad, Penny. It's a classic rookie mistake. My first Chanukah with Sheldon, he yelled at me for eight nights.</p>", "3905": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> That doesn't count. Do over! Do over!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> There are always do-overs when my people play sports.</p>", "3906": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Dave is not smarter than you. He's an idiot.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? Why would you say that?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He tried to take nude photos of you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's what you took from that? The guy is married.</p>", "3907": "<p><strong>Rajesh:</strong> Oh,snap.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Snap what?</p>", "3908": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong>  Then I suggest you get them down with a long stick and play panty piata.</p>", "3909": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Alright, Klingons, pencils down.</p>", "3910": "<p><strong>Leslie:</strong> So, dumbass, I heard you made a grad student throw up last night.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. But why should I cater to second-rate minds?<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Because first-rate minds call you \"dumbass\"?</br></p>", "3911": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just because your career's been stagnant for a few years, that's no reason to give up.</p>", "3912": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Honey, you'll be fine as long as you don't do that bungee cord thing, okay?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, didn't you recently state that you and I are friends?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Then I hereby invoke what I'm given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship. The favor.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, dear God.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was interrupting your morning prayers. When you're done, we'll go.</p>", "3913": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It's not part of my heart-warming and personal narrative, in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Poverty? Your father's a gynaecologist. He drives a Bentley.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's a lease.</p>", "3914": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven, my sister bought our father a \"world's greatest dad\" coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died.</p>", "3915": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, Saturday night.

Boy, you'd think you could trust a horde of Hungarian barbarians.</br></p>", "3917": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why should I do something? You're the one who introduced her to online gaming.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, yes, but you're the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If you'd just simply restrained yourself, none of this would be happening.</br></p>", "3918": "<p><strong>Sheldon: </strong> Danger! Danger!</p>", "3919": "<p><strong>Leslie:</strong> Anyway, I just figure it's time to slow things down and who better to slow things down with than you?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I'm flattered. So, how do you suggest we proceed?<br><strong>Leslie:</strong> Your place, we'll order Chinese, you'll rent a movie, artsy but accessible, then light petting, no coitus.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sounds fun.<br><strong>Leslie:</strong> I'll leave the details up to you, I think it's better if you assume the male role.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you, that's very thoughtful.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Great. Call me!</br></br></br></br></p>", "3920": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Go get yourself some rebound stress release.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Technically, it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You mean like you and Richard the slave girl?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I bought him dinner and we kissed once. That was it. And he told me his name was Kimberly.</p>", "3921": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I've dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary. The word plenty has been redefined to mean two.</br></p>", "3922": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can't be accurately measured by normal tests, how much scarcer could I be?</br></p>", "3923": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> They don't care for it if  you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that's my homerun swing.</p>", "3924": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Give him time.</p>", "3925": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Apparently, he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog, which I cannot find anywhere.</p>", "3926": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Not now, I have a blog to find.</p>", "3927": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Excuse me.<br><strong>Althea:</strong> Fill this out, have a seat.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> No, listen. See, we're throwing my friend a surprise party and I'm supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours.<br/><strong>Althea:</strong> Uh-huh. Fill this out and have a seat.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, the only way I could get him to leave is to tell him I ate a peanut. Because I'm allergic to peanuts.<br/><strong>Althea:</strong> Oh, well in that case fill this out and have a seat.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Look, all I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a band-aid so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine and then you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour, hour and a half.<br/><strong>Althea:</strong> Is that all you need?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Althea:</strong> Get out of my ER.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, you don't understand.<br/><strong>Althea:</strong> Oh, I understand, but unfortunately this hospital is not equipped to treat stupid.</br></br></p>", "3928": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, guys, some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's called trestling.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, that's terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out.</p>", "3929": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We might as well stop. It's a stalemate. You're beating me at tetris, but you've got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf.</p>", "3930": "<p><strong>Shopper:</strong> Excuse me, do you know anything about this stuff?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know everything about this stuff.</br></p>", "3931": "<p><strong>Shopper:</strong> Which hard drive do I want? Firewire or USB?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It depends on what Bus you have.<br/><strong>Shopper:</strong> I drive a Chevy Cavalier.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh my God.</p>", "3932": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why don't you tell them I take tolls at the Golden Gate Bridge? A Rocket Scientist, how humiliating!</p>", "3933": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> (Mocking Howard) Ooh! Look at me, I don't have a foreskin!</p>", "3934": "<p><strong>Missy:</strong> (Talking to the guys) He was trying to build some sort of armed robot to keep me out of his room.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.</p>", "3935": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> She's not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother, who's apparently very sick. Oh, and I believe she has to wash her hair.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, you poor deluded bastard.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Don't start with me, dude.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You wanna go again? Let's go.</p>", "3936": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You can't. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake.</br></br></p>", "3937": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, here's the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.</br></p>", "3938": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Those are movies.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, of course they're movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That's absurd.</br></p>", "3939": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, it's two in the morning.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, it's my turn.</p>", "3940": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no, not Morlocks, not flesh eating Morlocks! Help!</p>", "3941": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I need my wrist brace. All this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury.</p>", "3942": "<p><strong>Howard</strong>: I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy.\n<br/><strong>Leonard</strong>: Then why do we go home alone every night? We're still smart.\n<br><strong>Rajesh</strong>: Maybe we're too smart. So smart it's off-putting.\n<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, let's go with that.\n</br></br></p>", "3943": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Here's the problem with teleportation.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Lay it on me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How about that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, he would be exactly the same.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That is a problem.</br></p>", "3944": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, Dennis, how long have you been in America?<br/><strong>Dennis Kim:</strong> A year and a half.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No kidding. You speak English really well.<br/><strong>Dennis Kim:</strong> So do you. Except for your tendency to end sentences with prepositions.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you talking about?<br/><strong>Dennis Kim:</strong> That.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He's not wrong.</p>", "3945": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I've been at this lab for three years, you've never came by to say hello.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, up until now I've had better things to do. So, what are we making today?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that's going up on the next space shuttle.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really, how does it work?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, huh. So it's a shelf?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, you don't understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide ... yeah, okay, it's a shelf.</br></p>", "3946": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, as I predicted, I am sick. My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No kidding?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?</p>", "3947": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You just lied to Penny.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, I did.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And you did it so casually. No rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, lack of physiological response while lying is a characteristic of a violent sociopath.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, are you worried about your safety?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. I imagine if you were going to kill me, you'd have done it a long time ago.</p>", "3948": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We just leave the house on Friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So he goes back into rehab?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. But he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You still told her I lied.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. How am I supposed to remember all of this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's the best part. You don't have to. See, I told Penny that you would be embarrassed if you knew that she found out that you had lied. So she's agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So she's expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when in actuality we're pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Un-unravelable.</p>", "3949": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So, road trip to Long Beach.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, we're not going to Long Beach.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because Sheldon doesn't have a drug addicted cousin Leopold.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, too bad. I've always wanted to go to Long Beach.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there. Once the largest ocean liner in the world, it's now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sounds fun.</p>", "3950": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgmental strangers, who wouldn't recognize true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. Which, if I were there, it would be.</p>", "3951": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Is this your only tie?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ah. Technically yes, but, if you'll notice, it's reversible. So it works as two.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, sweetie, I don't think it even works as one.</p>", "3952": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You cannot possibly be that arrogant.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You continue to underestimate me, my good man.</p>", "3953": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Is it me or does web-chatting with your clothes on seem a little pointless?</p>", "3954": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If we're all through playing \"Mock the Flawed Technology\", can we get on with Halo Night? We were supposed to start at 8, it is now 8:06.</p>", "3955": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You have a TV in your room. Why don't you have breakfast in bed?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.</p>", "3956": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, how was paint ball? Did you have fun?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard) You clear a space on your calendar. There will be an inquiry.</p>", "3957": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.</p>", "3958": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard's had girls over before, right?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, yes, but there's usually planning, courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I didn't have to, the dates just happened to coincide.</br></br></p>", "3959": "<p><strong>Leslie:</strong> Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.</p>", "3960": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You can't find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life.</p>", "3961": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> You have to take your time with Sheldon. His father, God rest his soul, always used to say to me \"Mary, you have to take your time with Sheldon.\"</p>", "3962": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Everybody grab a plate and a pretty place-mat that Shelly wove.</p>", "3963": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well what happened?<br><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> The poor boy had a fit. Locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> A death ray?<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Well, that's what he called it. It didn't even slow down the neighbor kids. It pissed our dog off to no end.</br></p>", "3964": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Raj, no, it's a trap. They're flanking us!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oooh, he's got me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, he's got Raj. Use your sleep spell. Sheldon! Sheldon!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've got the Sword of Azeroth!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There is no more Sheldon. I am the Swordmaster!</p>", "3965": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, who am I kidding? I can't go through with this, you need to call her and cancel.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What should I tell her?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she'll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Got it. So I'm assuming nothing venereal.

Because you're a man. The champagne of genders.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I may be a man, but I think I'm the one that screwed up on this one.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And you admit it.

Why not celebrate early?<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So, where do you wanna go?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> I hear that new Mexican place on Green St. is good.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Sure, sure. Or, we could take you to get a bikini wax.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why would I get a bikini wax for my birthday?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I don't know. It was just a thought.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I think I'll just stick to Mexican.</br></br></br></br></p>", "4025": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's Leonard. He said they're about to cross the border.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I hope the boys don't get too crazy in Mexico.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, yeah, right. Lock up your daughters or Sheldon might lecture them about the North American Free Trade Agreement.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Boy, that was a long night for me.</p>", "4026": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's called Lamaze breathing. It helps you push.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Great! He's pushing with his uterus.</p>", "4027": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let's take this problem one step at a time. First, we need to decide whether we're calling it lee-ver or lev-er.<br/>\nAnd the sooner we decide it's lee-ver, the sooner we can roll up our slee-ves - and not sle-ves - and get to work.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We're going to be here for ee-ver.</p>", "4028": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I didn't kill anything. You did, talking about your stupid TV show. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn't a decision to take lightly.

That's the commitment issue you're wrestling with?</p>", "4029": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Fine, what is it?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's to help re-open the Comic Book Store.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Nope.</p>", "4030": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy pointed out you were only trying to manipulate me.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Which you also figured out by yourself.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Which I also figured out by myself!</p>", "4031": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Where is this going?

You broke it!</p>", "4038": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, I've got a gunshot wound. That's pretty bad-ass.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> No, you've got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinky toe.\n</br></p>", "4039": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Leonard, there you are. I need you to check my head for chair lice.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I did it last night, I'm not doing it again.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Just his head, right?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't want to talk about it.\nYou didn't catch bugs from Penny's chair.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, I did. And now they're cavorting at the base of my hair follicles, like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Name one time I have ever done that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How about the time you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced that North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced that you started growing again.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I said name one. You really need to work on your listening skills. </p>", "4040": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can't believe we're going all the way to San Diego to confront this guy.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, we're kind of badasses, aren't we?</p>", "4041": "<p><strong>Priya:</strong> I guess he is a little quirky.<br><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Quirky?

Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there's this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won't lay any eggs. So, he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum.</p>", "4047": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's a lot of harm in trying something new. That's why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.</p>", "4048": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> My mother wouldn't let me ride a bicycle because she was afraid I might hit a bump and lose my virginity.</p>", "4049": "<p><strong>Howard</strong>: Hey, I'm damaged, too. How about a hug for Howie?</p>", "4050": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you drinking whiskey?\n<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Indeed. If I'm to participate in the social convention that is the \"stag night,\" then I must embrace all its components, including tobacco, swear words and, yes, alcohol.\nJeepers, that's yucky!</br></p>", "4051": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> This is going to be the biggest smackdown since my Aunt Noopur showed up at the family reunion wearing the same sari as my cousin Sruti.</p>", "4052": "<p>Raj (shouting from upstairs window): Hey, Jon Snow. How come your horse has a basket on it?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> How come your head has your face on it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They don't wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones. You're thematically inaccurate, but I applaud your commitment to safety.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Don't you guys have anything better to do?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl's bike? Nope.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> That's it, you just lost bathroom privileges at the comic book store.</p>", "4053": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, Meemaw, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is my Meemaw.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hi. So nice to finally meet you. Let me take this for you, Meemaw.<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. Now you call her Constance. I call her Meemaw. You have your own Meemaw.<br/>\nIt's not my fault she died when you were four.<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Is that nice to say to your friend?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It isn't, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can you please live with us forever?</p>", "4054": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's Amy. I just know you're gonna hit it off. You both have the same fashion sense.</p>", "4055": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Wipe that smug smile off your face.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (Laughing) I can't!</p>", "4056": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Let's just play.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll start you off easy. Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hmm. Well, I wouldn't fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse.<br/>\nSo I'd eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days I feel bloated.</p>", "4057": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, don't be offended, but what went wrong with you?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I guess I assumed at this point in my life, I would be married or in a relationship, or even have a pet that didn't run away or kill itself.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That really happened?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I mean, I can't say for sure, but I swear that rabbit looked me right in the eye before it hopped in front of that car.</p>", "4058": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay. Anyway, um, it's nice to see you. You look good.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thanks. And I taste good too.</p>", "4059": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What a wonderful day, thank you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, we're glad you had fun.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Blue Icees and a trip to The Container Store? It's like I died and went to the post-mortem, neuron-induced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven.</p>", "4060": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Dude, if we do this, we're gonna need a cool band name.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, I've actually had one I've been sitting on for years.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It was for this power trio I tried to put together in junior high, but I was short two friends.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What is it?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Footprints on the Moon.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I just got chills.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So did I.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Me, too. But I might have Lyme Disease.</p>", "4061": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, and lastly, please initial here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the universe and all alternate universes except for those universes where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen. In which case, all glory to the hive queen.</p>", "4062": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it's not.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How can you say that? Amy's gone, and you two are married now, so it's only a matter of time before you're gone, too.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, you don't know what's gonna happen.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I do. Eventually you'll want more space and you'll move into a house. And then instead of dinner a couple of times a week, it'll only be a couple of times a month. And then it'll only be on special occasions, like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz.<br/>\nOr-or-or like when Koothrappali's weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body.<br/>\nOr Amy's wedding, where she's marrying someone better than me.</p>", "4063": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Why am I so nervous?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's understandable. Amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with Sheldon.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah? How did it go? Did she make you crawl into the breaking-up drawer?</p>", "4064": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I see what's happening. Sides are forming. Well, if Bernadette's on Amy's team, I pick Howard.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm not taking sides.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. I guess I'm stuck with Raj.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> At least you got picked.</p>", "4065": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can just picture them right now at Feynman's house. Probably discussing Schrodinger, and at the same time not discussing Schrodinger.<br>\nSee, they're missing out on hilarious jokes like that.</br></p>", "4066": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh well, there were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's true.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> *Goes to grab phone* Son of a biscuit!</p>", "4067": "<p><strong>Dr. Lorvis:</strong> I was hoping to impress her by tracking her down on the Internet and then showing up announced at her door.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Making the extra effort. Good for you.</p>", "4068": "<p><strong>Dr. Lorvis:</strong> I met her at my office. She winked at me. And I came hoping to initiate a romantic relationship.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm pretty sure she didn't wink at you.<br/><strong>Dr. Lorvis:</strong> Oh, she did. Seductively, like this. And then she touched my arm for two Mississippis.</p>", "4069": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Please don't go. Up until my vicious attack, you were the one in the wrong.</p>", "4070": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> How'd you get that?<br/><strong>Dr. Lorvis:</strong> Easy. Gene Rodenberry needed a vasectomy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You've snipped Gene Rodenberry's vas deferens?<br/><strong>Dr. Lorvis:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wow, you really went where no man has gone before.</p>", "4071": "<p><strong>Dr. Lorvis:</strong> Welcome to my fortress of solitude. This is where I go to get away from all my other solitude.</p>", "4072": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Still lives with his mom? Yikes, right?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, I'm not quite sure how to respond.</p>", "4073": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thanks again for having us.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Of course. What do you guys want to talk about?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, now that we're engaged, we have some questions about how you handle money as a couple.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Told you they weren't going to ask us to swing with them.</p>", "4074": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> If I do well in sales, I could end up making a lot more money than you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not a problem. I grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life, so really it's what I think love looks like.</p>", "4075": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I would never leave you off my list. And not just because without you we're playing fast and loose with the word \"list\".</p>", "4076": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't know what Emily's so upset about anyway. Even if I had slept with him, so what? Everyone has a past.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Ahem.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Almost everyone has a past.</p>", "4077": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I love how they put a waterfall at centerfield. It really ties the whole stadium together.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Look at you talking sports.</p>", "4078": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can't talk. Spit ball. Probably gonna die.</p>", "4079": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> She's just so impossible, they keep quitting.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So who's watching her now?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> A bowl full of M&amp;Ms with a few Ambien tossed in.</p>", "4080": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> This is pretty cool. You don't see too many spherical cakes.<br>\n*The cake rolls off the table*<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I wonder why that is.</br></p>", "4081": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, you told me you were sick. But you look as pale and tired as always.</p>", "4082": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Only without the sex.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, literally none of it.</p>", "4083": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> How are you going to get James Earl Jones?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Simple. Earlier today he tweeted that he's looking forward to going to his favorite Sushi restaurant for dinner. I googled an interview from four years ago, which was conducted in his favorite Sushi restaurant and that's where he'll be. And that's where I'm going. And that's -<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And that's where Darth Vader is going to pour soy sauce on your head.</p>", "4084": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, she's due to tomorrow. But it did take her six years to finish high school, so who knows.</p>", "4085": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I just threw up on a whole lot of clowns.</p>", "4086": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What is wrong with you, Penny? You ruined any chance I had of getting back with Lucy. Now she knows I'm a desperate mess instead of being pretty sure.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> *Checks his phone* It's Lucy. She wants to meet for coffee. I LOVE YOU PENNY!</p>", "4087": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket clubcard. Do you have any idea the kind of coupons I'm going to get in the mail now?</p>", "4088": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I got a new bikini. The drinks at the pool will be brought to you by these.</p>", "4089": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Just, just call me Arthur.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, did you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we're friends.\n<strong>Professor Proton:</strong> No, a friend would've told me about the elevator.</p>", "4090": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> No offence, but I've been acting since I was a kid. I think I can handle a web show without a lot of direction.</p>", "4091": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You think your thoughts are pure gold, but let me tell you something they are pure caca.</p>", "4092": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I can't believe we spent three months in that frozen hell.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's like a snowy nightmare from which there's no awakening.</p>", "4093": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Ma, I'm putting you on speaker-phone with Raj's parents. Can you tell them that you're okay with me going to the Arctic?<br><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Arctic? I thought you said Arkansas.</br></p>", "4094": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Will you at least stipulate that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is inarguably the best?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I have 3 words for you: Wrath of Khan.</p>", "4095": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I love this time of the year. The leaves are turning, there's a bracing chill in the air.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Plus there's a whole new crop of female grad students about to put on just enough winter weight to make them needy and vulnerable. That's right, honey, have another calzone. Daddy can wait.</p>", "4096": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> (Talking to his private parts) I'm doing this for you, Little Buddy. (Eats the Granola bar)</p>", "4097": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, I get it, I know how the world works. How about if I were to introduce you to the man who freed your people? (laying down a $5 bill)<br/><strong>Althea:</strong> Unless my people were freed by Benjamin Franklin and his 5 twin brothers, you are wasting your time.</p>", "4098": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Unbelievable! Components I built are on the International Space Station and I get a ticket for launching a rocket in the park.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know if the ticket was so much for the launch as for telling the policewoman \"You have to frisk me, I have another rocket in my pants\"!</p>", "4099": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't believe it!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years.</p>", "4100": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So who wants to rent Fiddler?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No need. We have the special edition.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, maybe we are like Haroun and Tanweer.</p>", "4101": "<p><strong>Leslie:</strong> I didn't know you eat here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.</p>", "4102": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You hit me. I'm bleeding.</p>", "4103": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, so the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably won't be relying on Suess here. Although One Fish Two Fish, Red Fish Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable here.</p>", "4104": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> It's amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement to change their sheets.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay!</p>", "4105": "<p><strong>Girl</strong>: What are you? <br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I'm gonna give you a hand: weawww. <br/><strong>Girl</strong>: A Choo choo train? <br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Close! weawwww <br/><strong>Girl</strong>: A brain damaged choo choo train?</p>", "4106": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, what happened between you and Amy?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can you believe she said I embarrassed her?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah.</br></br></p>", "4107": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Are you insane, the guy was wearing an eyepatch.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, then why did you--<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> He said I could drive a car on Mars!</p>", "4108": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny. What happens if I blow it?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, if we accept your premise, and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you, then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny. The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby-Doo cartoons comes to mind.</br></p>", "4109": "<p><strong>Howard</strong>: How's the air matress? <br> <strong>Sheldon</strong>: It's okay, if you don't mind sleeping on a bouncy castle.</br></p>", "4110": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's going on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We scored. I'm the wingman.</p>", "4111": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't understand your objection, Professor Goldfarb. Why wouldn't the Sonora Desert make a perfectly good Promised Land?<br/><strong>Goldfarb:</strong> Go away!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We could call it Nuevo Jerusalem.<br/><strong>Goldfarb:</strong> Please go away!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Said Pharaoh to Moses!</p>", "4112": "<p><strong>Leslie Winkle:</strong> Leonard. Hey, it's been a while.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Leslie. I can't remember the last time we talked. So much has changed.<br><strong>Leslie Winkle:</strong> Has it?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, uh, um, Penny and I got married.<br><strong>Leslie Winkle:</strong> Wow, congratulations. You know, actually, I thought you'd be living with Sheldon forever.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, .... Well, don't be a stranger.</br></br></br></br></br></p>", "4113": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didn't think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, I used to hate these hugs. Now they're just extremely irritating.</br></p>", "4114": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can you focus on what we're talking about?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right. Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Even drunk, he's still smarter than all of us.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And stronger. Yeah, who wants to see me beat up the bartender?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'd enjoy that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nah, she's a good kid.</p>", "4115": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Here's a fun Postal fact. Yeah, the inner side of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction. So, if you broke my right thumb, that's Pasadena city police. But if you broke my left thumb, that's the FBI.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If I'm going to jail, I'm killing him, not breaking his thumb.</p>", "4116": "<p><strong>Claire:</strong> Wow. You've been talking about Frozen for an hour?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You should've seen us after The Good Dinosaur.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period, and it changed my life.</p>", "4117": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Boy, who would've thought when you asked me to move in and help take care of your mom, I'd still be here two years later?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No one.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Nobody thought that.</p>", "4118": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hi, Sheldon. What's up?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good news. You're an asteroid.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Uh, please tell me what to say next.</p>", "4119": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you, Arthur. You are the wisest of the wise.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Well, that's very nice of you to say, but I think I'm just an expression of your unconscious mind.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, sure. Well, you're fun to look at.</p>", "4120": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Do you think Sheldon's actually going to go through with it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't know. He said he's ready.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, but he also swore this was the year he'd be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin.</p>", "4121": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hi, Sheldon. What's up?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I'm calling because Thanksgiving is coming up, and I wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No one can go with you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. They'd rather spend the holiday with each other than find out if this is the year I finally touch a starfish.</p>", "4122": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you have any questions for me?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Just one. Are you doing okay?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Good. I want you to be happy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe you. I'd believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here.</p>", "4123": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Listen, I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isn't a good idea.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Barry, a word?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And now the crazy version of what I just said.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you intend to pursue Amy, you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> And how are you gonna do that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> By challenging you to a duel.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> You've had one lesson. I'll destroy you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today. If you're worth your salt as an instructor, I should be ready by then.<br/>\nYeah, and be warned. I'm going to touch you all over.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wow, that was crazier than I thought.</p>", "4124": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, there's a woman. I'll make her my girlfriend.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Whoa, whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn't work.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're forgetting something. Ladies love jocks.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How many sips of that beer did he have?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Three.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, boy.</p>", "4125": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I still don't understand why you bought that pill caddie. You're a young man.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Age is a state of mind, Leonard. In here I'm 90.</br></p>", "4126": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know what they don't sell at The Container Store? Something large enough to contain my disappointment.<br/>\nAlthough, if anyone did, it would be them.</p>", "4127": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Have you seen this Archie comic? It's actually Archie versus Predator.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> How could Archie defeat Predator?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know. Maybe Jughead's a Terminator.</p>", "4128": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I appreciate your interest in the apartment. I just need to ask you a few standard questions.<br/><strong>Applicant:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It says here you're a chemist. Which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches?<br/><strong>Applicant:</strong> Is that supposed to be a joke?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Looks like argon's not the only one with an attitude problem.</p>", "4129": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it there's a simple solution.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!</p>", "4130": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, I got you a little gift. <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, that's a lot of Girl Scout Cookies. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You know me. I'm from India. I can't resist children begging. </p>", "4131": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> No, come on, I wanna do it. Let's you, me and your very, very pale feet make some art.</p>", "4132": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Please go to Mars.</p>", "4133": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You will not believe what Stephen Hawking just said.<br/><strong>Penny, Amy and <strong>Bernadette:</strong></strong> Get out!</p>", "4134": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, I can't even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of my mother saying \"Stuart, which one is Thrones?\"</p>", "4135": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Usually when someone's being talked about behind their back, it's me and it's right in front of my face.</p>", "4136": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You tracked my phone?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We were worried about you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't be melodramatic. I'm just getting on a train and leaving for ever.</p>", "4137": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know he can't take a trip like this by himself.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> He's a grown man.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, he looks like a grown man. You've seen Freaky Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies.</p>", "4138": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You're a big cry baby. You start, I'll join in.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I am not a cry baby.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Toy Story 3.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The toys were holding hands in a furnace!</p>", "4139": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. So what have you got for me?<br/><strong>Arthur:</strong> Uhmm ... Always get a pre-nup.</p>", "4140": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You're a good friend. I'll owe you one.<br><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz (off-screen):</strong> Howard, help me get out of the tub!<br/>\n*Howard looks at Raj*<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Not that one!</br></p>", "4141": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don't tell her how disappointed I am and how I'll never forgive her.</p>", "4142": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, my beer isn't flat and my rack's not saggy, so far the future's great.</p>", "4143": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nine years, eleven months and three weeks ago, he followed that up replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I was there. It was funny!</p>", "4144": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What's going on?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Maybe you should have a seat.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I know my mom's not dead, there'd be balloons.</p>", "4145": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> This is really sad, and in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago.</p>", "4146": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What else would you love? Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayze's head.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, you could stand outside with a boombox in the air.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's from \"Say Anything\".<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Look, I'm a lonely guy. I watch a lot of movies.</p>", "4147": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look at her, desperately wishing she was over her at the cool table.<br/>\n[Cut to Amy laughing with her colleagues at another table]<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't worry little moth, the flame will come to you.</p>", "4148": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> My heart is stone. From now on, I'm a monk. I renounce all worldly pleasures. Except for lobster. And garlic butter.</p>", "4149": "<p><strong>Santa:</strong> (By a cannon, pointed at Sheldon) This is for leaving me in the dungeon to be eaten alive by ogres!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, uh, uh, hang on. In my defense<br/><strong>Santa:</strong> Ho, ho, ho, ya big dork. (Fires cannon)</p>", "4150": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, okay, Howard wins.</p>", "4151": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why would I feel safer with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know, he was pretty bad ass on Heroes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nope. Sorry Quinto, you're going back!</p>", "4152": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Hello, dear.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> You called my mother?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Leonard, is it really necessary to caption the obvious?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> He's been like that since he was a toddler. Look, Mommy, a butterfly. Maddening.</br></br></p>", "4153": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm Batman.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I hardly think so. The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he's running late.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I had to walk. I couldn't get Raj on the back of my scooter.\n</p>", "4154": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> But there is something I should prepare you for.<br><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh, relax, Leonard. I have raised that boy. I have seen him at his best and I've seen him at his worst. There's nothing he can do that will surprise me.<br/></br></p>", "4155": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I saw what you did there.<br><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> He thinks he's such a smarty pants. He's no different from any  man. You tell him not to do something, that's all they want to do. If I hadn't told my brother Stumpy not to clear out the woodchipper by hand, we'd still be calling him Edward.</br></p>", "4156": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What do you mean you didn't get the job? How could you not get it?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, he's British, I'm Indian. Ever since Gandhi, they haven't liked us very much.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because we should file a complaint.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong>That's okay, a complaint's been filed.\n</p>", "4157": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Whatever. Jesus still loves you.</p>", "4158": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong>Hey, isn't that the guy who won the MacArthur genius grant last year? (everyone looks) No, not all at once.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Then how?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Leonard. Now Raj. Now Sheldon.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I didn't get a good look. Can I go again?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No.</p>", "4159": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> When they perfect human cloning, I'm gonna order 12 of those.</p>", "4160": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (On the phone) This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the planetarium. Yeah, well, I'm sorry too, but there's just no room for you in my wallet. No, I understand, but it was between you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have dinosaurs. Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-bye.</p>", "4161": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship. Bazinga!</p>", "4162": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you set on people laughing WITH you? Because if you're cool with AT you ...<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't get it.</br></p>", "4163": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm just really glad you're back.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Me too. I've got a lot of TV to catch up on.</br></p>", "4164": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie, the estrogen is getting absorbed by your skin. That's why you've been all bloated, moody and a giant pain in the ass.</p>", "4165": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Lobster traps?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. That's how Velma and Scooby smuggled Shaggy into the old lighthouse.<br/></p>", "4166": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What just happened?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Beats the hell outta me!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'll tell you what happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian Chicks.</p>", "4167": "<p><strong>Wolowitz</strong>: It is I, Sir Howard of Wolowitz.</p>", "4168": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: If you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?<br><strong>Penny</strong>: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she's kind of family.<br/></br></p>", "4169": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Please be good, please be good. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay, she writes like she cooks.</p>", "4170": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Running from the angry mob) Why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one?</p>", "4171": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Koko learned to understands over 2000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes.</p>", "4172": "<p><b>Leonard:</b> You shush. I'm happy. I want to talk about it.</p>", "4173": "<p><strong>Dr. Plimpton:</strong> Can I ask you a question Howard? Do you like role-playing games?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, sure. In fact, I'm a dungeon master.</p>", "4174": "<p><strong>Kripke:</strong> I'm Barry Kripke and I'm here because you told me there was a raffle. Where is the raffle?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Patience, patience, Barry, the waffle-- ahem. The raffle... is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly.<br/><strong>Kripke:</strong> One more question--<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, you must be present to win.</p>", "4175": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What about you, Stuart? Do you have a girlfriend yet?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, yeah. Yeah, I met her at Comic-con. The one place in the world where saying, \"I own a comic book store\", is an actual pick-up line.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, well, good for you.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Not really, she's horrible. When she wants to have sex, she puts on her plus-size Wonder Woman costume and shouts, \"Who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane?\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong>Why don't you just break up with her.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Heh, no, I can't.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Because then I'd be alone. Like you.</p>", "4176": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You mean, like a date?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not <em>like</em> a date, a date.<br/></p>", "4177": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> The Good Wife is on. I tell you, this is my new Grey's Anatomy.</p>", "4178": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at paintball.</p>", "4179": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Goodnight puny human!</p>", "4180": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Why do you keep tying and untying that bow tie?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't seem to get it even.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I don't think it's supposed to be even. Sometimes a little asymmetry looks good. In the Renaissance, they called it \"sprezzatura.\"<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The Renaissance? Amy, you know I'm more of an Enlightenment person. At some point, we have to decide how we want to raise the children.</br></br></br></p>", "4181": "<p><strong>Missy:</strong> Hey, Shelly.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm so glad you made it, Missy. This is my fianc\u00e9e, Amy. Amy, this is my sister. If I ever need a kidney, this is where you get it.</br></p>", "4182": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I need it. It's the only way to settle the contradictions between gravity and quantum mechanics.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, it's too much money, you can't ask for that all at once.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, what if I ask for it in six easy installments of $83,333,333.33?</br></br></p>", "4183": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Hello, Sheldon. I suppose you've come here to tell me that you've moved me to your super secret enemies list.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't have a super secret enemies list. I'm not a Bond villain. I'm just a regular guy, with a regular enemies list.</br></p>", "4184": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Do you think Zack stole it?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> No, he doesn't know how to steal Bitcoin. I mean, he waves at trucks.</br></p>", "4185": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I thought you were looking at a cliff on the beach.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> We were, but Sheldon didn't like any of them. Some were too beachy, some were too cliffy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And all of them were too outsidey.</br></p>", "4186": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Hey, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've been thinking about it, and I suppose I could help you with your research.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> What changed your mind?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Bert, I'm a gift horse. Don't look me in the mouth.</p>", "4187": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't believe you don't care.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Believe it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I care, a lot, and Wil Wheaton will rue the day he ever met me.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> I think that's true of most people.</p>", "4188": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong>  Uh, no. No, baby. I'm not your mama. Your mama's the nice lady we're gonna go see right now so I can rub this in her face. Do you hear that, suckers? She called me Mama!</p>", "4189": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, uh, hey, Beverly, you called my phone, not Leonard's.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Actually, I was hoping to speak with you. Is this a good time?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, that depends. What time is it where you are?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Uh, just after 5:00.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (clears throat, and swaps fruit juice for a bottle of wine) Yeah, that counts.</p>", "4190": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I thought we agreed on June 15.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's the day after Flag Day. Everyone'll be partied out.</p>", "4191": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I found the perfect wedding date.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's terrific!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, it's not. It was May 19, 1996. We would have had a lovely wedding. And our honeymoon would have coincided with the first appearance of the Hale-Bopp comet.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, you were 16.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And in Texas. No one would have batted an eye. Oh, wait, it's no good. That's the day that Jon Pertwee, the third Doctor Who, died.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And it's in the past.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey-hey, I said it's no good. Just let it go.</p>", "4192": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Some news of our wedding. I have sent you all a \"save the date\" e-mail.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, exciting. You guys picked a date?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Better. I picked 80 dates. And I need you to save them all until we narrow it down.</p>", "4193": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> We just need a weekend date that's completely boring and uneventful.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Too bad you didn't get your ducks in a row, 'cause tonight would have been perfect.</p>", "4194": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, just a reminder, I'm going out for drinks after work.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. Great. Just a reminder, you're pregnant.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm not drinking, just taking a new coworker out.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. Just a reminder, you're married.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Female coworker. She's new in town, and I want to make her feel welcome. And let her know the office is full of liars before everyone tells her I'm mean.</p>", "4195": "<p><strong>Ruchi:</strong> So, what do you guys do?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I am an astrophysicist, so if you ever go out at night and look up at the stars, that's kind of my office. He sells comic books to children.</p>", "4196": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Actually, I own my own store. Uh, if you'd like to check it out sometime, I'm running a new promotion: buy anything, get taken out for a reasonably priced dinner.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, yeah, Stuart's struggling financially. But he doesn't let that get him down. He believes in himself. Even though the whole world has made it clear he should not.</p>", "4197": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You know, there's so much money in pharmaceuticals, we don't even wash out our old test tubes. We just throw 'em out and get new ones.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I just got a brand new, state-of-the-art fMRI machine.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Whoa, those things are so expensive.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I know! Sometimes I just lie down in there and take a nap. It's like a million dollar bunk bed.</p>", "4198": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm surprised Sheldon's not up here playing with all your new toys.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Actually, I haven't told him about it. We've been getting so much more funding than physics, he's been a little sensitive.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So you're just gonna hide your success from him?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I know. Am I terrible?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No. I do that, too! Howie thought my company retreat was in Boise? It was in Tahiti.</p>", "4199": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> That's such a relief. I mean, part of me was worried I was being unfair to Sheldon.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Take that part of yourself and hide it away. Just like I did with last year's bonus check that I didn't get.</p>", "4200": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, I know I screwed up, but it was only one interview. How much damage could it have caused?<br><strong>Ms. Davis:</strong> Would you like for me to read you the e-mails from donors asking why are they giving us money if physics is a dead end?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I didn't say it was a dead end. I just said that I was worried it might be.<br/><strong>Ms. Davis:</strong> So if I just said I was worried you might not have a job next week, how would you feel?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Light-headed, and glad you asked me to sit down.</br></p>", "4201": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Read it back to me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, hang on. \"Yes, one might question the $20 billion \"to build and run the Large Hadron Collider, but on the other hand...\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. Um, oh, oh! \"On the other hand, contrary to predictions, the collider didn't create a small black hole that devoured the Earth and life as we know it.\" So, money well spent.</p>", "4202": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on. You guys are physicists. Okay? You're always gonna be physicists. And sure, sometimes, the physics is hard, but isn't that what makes it boring?</p>", "4203": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, hey, where you been? We've been calling you for hours.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry, my phone was on \"airplane\" mode.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because I was on an airplane. (makes confused gesture to Amy)</p>", "4204": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know what? Let me give you a better question. Here, um, \"Dr. Cooper, \"I heard you were working on a top-secret project \"for the U.S. military. Why don't you tell us about that?\" See, that's a great question.<br/><strong>Dr. Harris:</strong> Okay, what was that like?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I can't tell you that, it's top-secret.</p>", "4205": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, whenever I find a top I like, I always go back and get a second one in a different color. Which I hope is not the case with your baby.</p>", "4206": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, for starters, there's nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, what do you say to that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think we should see other people.</p>", "4207": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Wail till I Snapchat that my friends might be working on a top secret government project.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you crazy? You can't put that on Snapchat.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Fine, I'll put it on Facebook like a caveman.</p>", "4208": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I mean, seriously, you have got to let me scan your brain when you're being dishonest so I can see what lights up.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's super helpful, Amy. Thanks a lot. I can't wait to do that.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I can see a clump of bitch cells lightin' up from here.</p>", "4209": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Oh, man, I didn't mean to do that. But I do appreciate you recognizing my swimmer's body. Which, incidentally, I got from playing Marco Polo at the YMCA.</p>", "4210": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Boy, you get some dirty looks over there when you ask for ice.</p>", "4211": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What is it?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, your birthday's coming up and you've never let us celebrate it. And I was hoping maybe this year we could.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I suppose that's a discussion we could have. (Sheldon runs back up the stairs)<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, great, I mean, it doesn't have to be a big party or anything. I was just - Where'd he go?</p>", "4212": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Very well. You may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love. But then you owe me big-time.</p>", "4213": "<p><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Sheldon, tell this girl that my ring will never be on her finger.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I'm gonna opt out of that one, too.</p>", "4214": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and make him into a better person.<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> I did.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, well, that is exactly what I've been doing the last five years with this little work in progress.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He never disappoints, does he?</p>", "4215": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I brought you a little care package from work. It's our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I hope laughter is the best medicine, 'cause this care package is a joke.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, she came all the way here- (Sheldon sneezes on Howard)<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (Handing Howard the care package) You're gonna want to take these with food.</br></p>", "4216": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard and Bernadette, you tried to comfort me when I was ill, and I treated you terribly. I'm sorry.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wow. I'm impressed.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, no, no, wait. I'm not done. Allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee's \"I'm Sorry\" played on the pan flute.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Apology accepted!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Forgiven, forgiven!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, that's eight hours of practice down the drain.</p>", "4217": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hmm. (looking around at the room)<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I just have never been in this room while you're awake.</p>", "4218": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> And you know we get to name it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We better choose a name no one can make fun of. Sir Frederick William Herschel didn't do Uranus any favors.</p>", "4219": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What is happening? Are we missing him?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, that's not what this feeling is. Is it?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Of course not. He drove us crazy. Like when you were gonna make that pie and Stuart ate all the blueberries.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That was pretty cute.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah. Eww, we are missing him!</p>", "4220": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Good for Sheldon, deciding to stay with Amy on her birthday.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know. It's still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We could wait a couple of days and see it together.<br/>\n*All three laughing*</p>", "4221": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So where's he taking you?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, he's coming here. I'm actually making dinner.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, that's a big step.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It is?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, you're inviting him into your home. It's intimate. It's where your underpants live.</p>", "4222": "<p><strong>Dave:</strong> Well, no need to be nervous with me. I'm just a harmless giant from a foreign land.</p>", "4223": "<p><strong>Emily:</strong> So, how does this work?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> The soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs, and the shifts are six hours.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Six hours? Oh, God, I don't want to complain for that long.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Do you ever do anything for anyone else?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I happen to be a giving and generous lover.</p>", "4224": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Fine. You think you know so much. Who's my favorite Spice Girl?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Baby.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Who's my favorite member of NSYNC?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Justin.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Who's my favorite Backstreet Boy?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (Scoffs) Nice try. NSYNC forever.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Damn it!</p>", "4225": "<p><strong>Elon Musk:</strong> Nice to meet you, Howard. Feels great to come down here and help the less fortunate, huh?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, yeah. Nothing better than helping people.<br/>\nWhich is something I realized when I was viewing Earth from the deck of the International Space Station, where I spent two months as a payload specialist, a job I was qualified for because I'm an MIT-trained engineer.<br/><strong>Elon Musk:</strong> And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.</p>", "4226": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, I made French toast sticks.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> On oatmeal day?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ah, I also made oatmeal.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ooh, that's a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. You know what? You eat it. You're married, it doesn't matter what you look like.</p>", "4227": "<p><strong>Adam Nimoy:</strong> What was it about Spock that appealed to you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion.<br/>\nSpock came from a planet governed only by logic.<br/>\nYou know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks, \"Why are you hitting yourself?\" The answer is, \"I'm not. You're moving my arm.\" To which he says, \"fascinating.\" And then you both watch educational television.</p>", "4228": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> When did we get a wall safe?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When there was no more room in the floor safe.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> When did we get a floor safe?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When we got the security camera.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> There's a security camera?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, my God. We've done things on that couch.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, you don't have to tell me.</p>", "4229": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, he's cute!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Doesn't a teardrop tattoo mean he murdered someone?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And he's sad about it.</p>", "4230": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Uh, excuse me, can I have my phone back?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Hang on, I'm trying to find you the next great love of your life. The man who will father your children.<br/>\nOkay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?</br></p>", "4231": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Aren't we being a little mean?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's a fair point. We wouldn't make fun of someone like this to their face.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, it's Stuart!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You may want to leave the room.</p>", "4232": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> And how many guys have you gone out with?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Please be less than two.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Three.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Damn it.</p>", "4233": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I thought you were Puss in Boots.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.<br/>\nMy name is Puss in Boots. You killed my father. Prepare to die.</p>", "4234": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So that's all this day was? A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, buddy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I thought we were friends. You asked for a sip of my Icee. If you had your own straw, I might've said yes.</p>", "4235": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I got married recently.<br/><strong>Mandy:</strong> Oh, congratulations. To Sheldon?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ah, ha, never gets old.</p>", "4236": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy's upset? Is it about me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I think it's because we're eloping.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Your marriage is causing her pain? You know great, I take it back. Go ahead and do it. Yay for love!</p>", "4237": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hang on. I believe I'm supposed to carry you across the threshold.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Can you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV?</p>", "4238": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Do you wanna tell me what happened?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you gonna say it's all part of God's plan?<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Good chance.</p>", "4239": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure. Let's make it an even hundred.</p>", "4240": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, you should totally get it. In fact, I'll buy it for you. <br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Sold! <br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Raj, you don't have to do that. <br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Too late! No returns!</p>", "4241": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side? <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You mean 'cause she has weird tattoos? <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard.</p>", "4242": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> The only issue is that everybody has their own thing. And as long as it's two consenting adults, I guess I don't see the harm in it. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, what if it's one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he's afraid of being alone? <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, then I guess bring a blanket. The grass gets damp at night.</p>", "4243": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard's mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she's here? <br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Are you ashamed of me? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course not. I love you. I'm just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Well, I love you, too, my little bowl of lion chow.</p>", "4244": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> You must be very proud of your son. <br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oh, yes. He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> He did? <br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oh, you mean this son. Uh, sure, he's terrific.</p>", "4245": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, maybe there's a way to appear nonaggressive, but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand, but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger. <br><strong>Howard:</strong> You want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? That's ridiculous. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?</br></p>", "4246": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do either of you know Beyonce? I'd love her to get behind it.</p>", "4247": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just this morning, Sheldon wouldn't let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You should've told him to mind his own business.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. That's better than what I did say, which was, \"Fine, I'll eat them with club soda.\"</p>", "4248": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How do you want to start?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know. How do you want to start?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know.\nShould we call Sheldon and Howard?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, we can do this by ourselves.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Great. How do you want to start?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know. How do you want to start?</p>", "4249": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? It's my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I think you just answered your own question.</p>", "4250": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm a little nervous.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Right. *Pushes button*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You pushed it! Are you out of your mind?</p>", "4251": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Come on, get in her head. Be intimidating.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay. I'm gonna own you bitch!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Whoa!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Let's just play.</p>", "4252": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's not necessary.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It is. They're what hold back the urine and faeces.</p>", "4253": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I meant more like a little brother.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Well, I suppose I do think of you like a sister. And sometimes a mother.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's getting creepy again.</p>", "4254": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You look like a talking cupcake.</p>", "4255": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good to see you again, Mr. Stephen Hawking Liked Our Paper.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, and you as well, Mr. Our Premise Is Intriguing.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> How do you do, Mr. I'll Admit That's Pretty Cool.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure.</p>", "4256": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Why'd you pop it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sorry, I was aiming for your heart.</p>", "4257": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ladies.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What's up?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As you may know, I have been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels, and I thought what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless, uncensored crotch talk.</p>", "4258": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> \"Sheldon's Mine Simulation Log, entry 4: My KitKat has melted. All is lost.\"</p>", "4259": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well we're in Vegas. I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What if we don't want to vomit?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, you will. That's why they give you the bucket.</p>", "4260": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You guys, what are we doing? We sent the girls away so we could focus.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't think it worked.</br></p>", "4261": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Boy, if there's one thing that gets my goat, it's those dadgum insurance companies.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why, because they won't get off your lawn?</p>", "4262": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> All I know is he's got my mother buying four ply toilet paper. Four ply! If his butt is so delicate, why doesn't he use an Angora rabbit?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For starters, they shed and bite.</p>", "4263": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So you never played baseball as a kid? Not even little league?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, I was going to but the day of tryouts I found my dad's Playboy collection. Threw my arm out.</p>", "4264": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, can you think of a reason why I shouldn't invite Amy to come with me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, you didn't even try.</p>", "4265": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> No, not like us. Creepy chummy. Like you and your dog.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> She feeds him out of her own mouth?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I mean he calls her Debbie, she calls him Stewie, and they're all giggly around each other. And believe me when food goes in that mouth it does not come out.</p>", "4266": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm your son. What about the fact that she's good enough for me?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> *blank shrug* Sure.</p>", "4267": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So you have tattoos?<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> That's cool.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's a piercing.</p>", "4268": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> This is something interesting, boys and girls. After an owl eats, he spits up part of his meal, that he can't digest, in the form of a pellet. Isn't that a hoot?</p>", "4269": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Great. What do you want to do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know. What do you want to do?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't know. What do you want to do?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm starting to remember the problem with Anything Can Happen Thursdays.</p>", "4270": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boyband. Of course I'd be the dreamy one and the smart one.</p>", "4271": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Where are you going?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I need some fresh air.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Been there!</p>", "4272": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Fate has given me a rare second chance and I swear to Vishnu that I'm not going to blow it. ... Or normal words followed by a charming smile.</p>", "4273": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Actually, you're all just going to be yourselves.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, uck.</p>", "4274": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I called them. The part's gone. They gave it to someone else. Now some girl's going to get discovered and get famous, and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on some cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl though it was beneath her.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> At least they talk about you on Letterman.</p>", "4275": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, this again. So Penny proposed, you didn't say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> It doesn't!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you.</br></p>", "4276": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Great, because I've been thinking if I really want this acting thing to work, I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that, I should quit waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wow, that's a big step.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So before making any rash decisions.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I already quit.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And I support you!</p>", "4277": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know about you but I'm very uncomfortable about this.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've never seen this show before, and now I'm starting with episode 246. It's unnatural.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right.</p>", "4278": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> First, talking to you while you're on the toilet isn't exactly a picnic for me either. Remember, when you can hear me, I can hear you.</p>", "4279": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, riding with Leonard has got a little tedious lately. The only car game he ever wants to play is the quiet game. And he's terrible at it, I always win.</p>", "4280": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You want some mutton and coconut milk?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Boy I can not give this stuff away.</p>", "4281": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who would win in a fight, you or a shark?</p>", "4282": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> (To Penny) Way to hit 'em with both barrels.</p>", "4283": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> People should take care of themselves.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, like yesterday when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners, the pharmacy and the post office?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not saying people can't use tools. Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.</p>", "4284": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Yeah, yeah, you want a cigarette. Well, I'd like a normal boyfriend. Deal with it.</p>", "4285": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard Hofstadler...<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Will you be my valentine?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sorry. Maybe next year.\nI'm just kidding! Romance ninja. Let's have sex.</p>", "4286": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> $5,000 for a couple dolls. Are you out of your mind?</p>", "4287": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll be Coop and he'll be Wheels. If he's okay with that.</p>", "4288": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Actually, Barry, we're not going to have strippers tonight. <br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Aww, then what the flip did I get $200 in singles out for?</p>", "4289": "<p><strong>Stephen Hawking:</strong> You made an arithmetic mistake on page 2.<br/>\nIt was quite a boner.</p>", "4290": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> With women! I like to boogie with women!</p>", "4291": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sometime through the night an armadillo fell in, then he spooned me.</p>", "4292": "<p><strong><strong>Penny:</strong></strong> What's the word, hummingbird?<br/></p>", "4293": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I didn't want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.<br/></br></br></p>", "4294": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I drove, mother. I'm driving now.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Yes, dear. Mommy's proud.</p>", "4295": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I just don't understand why he knows more about your life than I do.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Well, I would assume it's because Sheldon and I stay in touch due to mutual interests and respect, while you avoid me due to unresolved childhood issues.</p>", "4296": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> It's hot in here, it must be Summer.</p>", "4297": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Destiny thy name is Anaheim!</p>", "4298": "<p><strong>Leslie:</strong> PMS? It's a couple of days early, but<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Oh, right, of course, what was I thinking?</p>", "4299": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure, if he wants to spend years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians and you're the one holding her head while she's puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you. And then she gets into Cornell, because you wrote her essay for her and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn't even know you.</p>", "4300": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Good morning, snickerdoodle. Well that looks awful fancy, what is that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon-based life-form.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> But intelligently designed by a creator, right?</p>", "4301": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Boy, I bet Ellen Page's friends aren't giving her this kind of crap!</p>", "4302": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Just think of me as a Brown Martha Stewart.</p>", "4303": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Studies are shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces ones reaction time by the same factors as ounce of alcohol.</p>", "4304": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Kandor was the Capital city of the planet, Krypton. It was miniaturized by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, nice!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.</p>", "4305": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't like the Olive Garden. They treat me like family.</p>", "4306": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> And I wish Leonard never told me. He's the bad guy here.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I guess that's true.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> And you let Penny marry him. Compared to that, who cares if I bought a George Clooney limited edition Manscaping kit.</br></br></p>", "4307": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It turns out being sweet isn't enough to keep a girl these days. I blame Madonna.</p>", "4308": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So me and the guys were talking about this great investment opportunity.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Nope.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But you didn't hear what it was.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I know.</p>", "4309": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, a relationship is more complicated than a french fry.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder &amp; Omoto.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, what did those rascals do now?</p>", "4310": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I don't mean to be rude, Sheldon, but my life is kinda falling apart right now.</p>", "4311": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Amy, it's Penny. Hey. Just a little heads up, Leonard bought a dining room table. Yeah, Sheldon's breaking up with you.</p>", "4312": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> That would really piss me off if I didn't have a buzz going on.</p>", "4313": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> When I was a baby, my mother called me her little possum.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Are possums cute?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Not at all.</p>", "4314": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm serious. Go to the mall, talk to anybody. Practice. That way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl, it won't be so scary.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Or just keep dating the possum.</p>", "4315": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> And this is Dr. Gundersen from Stockholm.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah, Sweden. Home of my favorite Muppet and second-favorite meatball.<br/>\n*Dr. Gundersen and Amy look blankly at Sheldon*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, the Nordic reputation for a lack of humor is well founded. Boy, is his name Gundersen or No-fun-dersen?</p>", "4316": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I suppose there's no choice but to face the crying, angry accusations, and the high pitch wails of despair.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah and who knows how Amy will react.</p>", "4317": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on satin sheets? I slid out of the bed like 3 times.</p>", "4318": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay. Hang on. Are you saying some day that you and Amy might actually get physical?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's a possibility.</p>", "4319": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I play Grand Theft Auto. I know about gats. *gun fires*</p>", "4320": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, Sheldon, guess what I've heard today.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'd imagine you heard any number of things today. When you arrived at work, you undoubtedly heard: Hello, Raj; How are you, Raj; and given you're wearing a new sweater vest, you may have heard: \"New Sweater Vest\" and possible, though less likely \"Nice Sweater Vest.\"</p>", "4321": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I've just discovered I don't have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition, so you and I are going to perform a full backup, re-initialize and then re-install all my operating systems.</p>", "4322": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Raj says he can teach you - what do call it? (Raj repeats it to him again.) Uh, I don't know some Indian meditation crap.</p>", "4323": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are \"stupid\"? No, never mind. It's right here.<br></br></p>", "4324": "<p><strong>Howard</strong>:  Forgive me for being so bold, but I now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.<br><strong>Mary</strong>: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.</br></p>", "4325": "<p><strong>Howard</strong>: I know the type. Cheerleader, student council,\ngoes out with the jocks, won't even look at anybody in the gifted program. If after 2 years of begging, she agrees to go out with you, it turns out to be a setup and you're in your mom's car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you. *sobbing*\n</p>", "4326": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I say we just take him to Tatooine and sell him to some Jawas.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's two, dude. Write your own jokes.</p>", "4327": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to stop.</p>", "4328": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong>  I think it's more like, uh, like Lord of the Rings, and you're the Fellowship. Uh, someone's got to go to Gondor, someone's got to go to Mordor, someone's got to hold off the demon of shadow and flame.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> You mean the Balrog?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I mean my mother.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That is a perfect metaphor, Amy.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because it also involves a ring that binds me in servitude forever.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Aw, he said forever.</br></p>", "4329": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> That was Wil Wheaton. He's really excited about tomorrow.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As am I. If you'd have told me as a child that an actor from Star Trek would be officiating my wedding, I would've said, \"Ooh, William Shatner?\" And if you'd have said, \"No, Wil Wheaton,\" I'd have said, \"Well, did you even try William Shatner?\" And if you'd have said, \"Yes, but he costs too much money,\" I'd have said, \"Ah, well, Wil Wheaton's good, too.\"</p>", "4330": "<p><strong>Mary:</strong> Thank you again for picking us up.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (chuckles) My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.<br/><strong>Mary:</strong> You know, our driver to the airport was also a Indian fella.<br/><strong>Missy:</strong> Mom!<br/><strong>Mary:</strong> Oh, so now it's racist to notice when somebody's Indian.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't think it's racist. I noticed you were both white.<br/><strong>Mary:</strong> See?</p>", "4331": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, you're Sheldon's big brother.<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> Uh, yeah. He got the brains. I got the bod. (chuckles) And the face and the hair.</p>", "4332": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, you said something about my bow tie that I can't stop thinking about.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Don't you mean (in a Southern accent): \"Y'all said something 'bout my bow tie\"? Go on, say it. Say it.</p>", "4333": "<p><strong>Georgie:</strong> Where's Mom?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, she wanted to stop by the hotel and freshen up, and then call her pastor to pray for Missy's soul.</p>", "4334": "<p><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> Oh, my God. There's mama's girl.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hi, Mom. <br/><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> Oh! Oh, Larry, look at her! Can you believe our little lamb is finally getting married? [Mr. Fowler steps forward and opens his mouth to answer] He can't believe it.<br/>\nAnd neither can I.</p>", "4335": "<p><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> Thank you so much for finding this guy. Oh, my goodness. Hey, Bark.<br>\nHow are you, buddy?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Y-Your dog's name is Bark?<br/><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Bark Hamill?<br/><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> Yeah. Well, I let the fans name him online. I got lucky, though. He was almost Honey Baked Hamill.</br></p>", "4336": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hey, dude.<br/><strong>Denise:</strong> Dude?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Yeah, you know, just want you to know that I don't think of you as a woman.<br/><strong>Denise:</strong> Oh, perfect. I don't think of you as a man.</p>", "4337": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Great. So, as two genderless blobs of human flesh, how would you like to go to Sheldon and Amy's wedding with me?<br/><strong>Denise:</strong> Oh, Stuart. Look, I appreciate that, but it just might be a little weird, considering you're my boss.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong>  Guess who's gonna officiate Sheldon and Amy's wedding! Mark Hamill! Luke Skywalker is gonna be at the wedding!<br/><strong>Denise:</strong> You'll need to buy me a dress.</p>", "4338": "<p><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> And did you know that my Amy played Amelia Earhart in the eighth grade?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Amy, you never said you were in a school play.<br/><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> Oh, no, no, at home. I'd never let her do a school play. Those kids just take drugs and have intercourse.</p>", "4339": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, Amy still does some performing. She and Sheldon do an Internet show about flags.<br/><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> Amy? V-Videos on the Internet? You know what men use those for.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> If you're talking about Fun with Flags, I use it to go to sleep.</p>", "4340": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Welcome, Bert. Don't you look nice.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Yeah. Like a geode, I clean up good.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't you crack a geode open?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> It's not a perfect metaphor.</p>", "4341": "<p><strong>Mary:</strong> Let me straighten your tie.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, no, no, it's all right. It's supposed to be a little asymmetrical. Apparently, a small flaw somehow improves it.<br/><strong>Mary:</strong> I can see that. Sometimes it's the imperfect stuff that makes things perfect.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me. *Sheldon rushes out of the room*<br/><strong>Mary:</strong> Case in point.</p>", "4342": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> So, we finally meet.<br/><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> I'm sorry, who are you?<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> (scoffs) I'm Wil Wheaton. I was supposed to officiate this wedding. I was up all night preparing these notes.<br/><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> Well, thanks so much. It's gonna be a great help.</p>", "4343": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, uh, the bride and groom seem to be running a little behind. Do you think you could stall?<br/><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> Stall? How?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, everybody! Uh, it's gonna be a few more minutes, but while we wait, does anyone have any questions about Star Wars? *lots of hands go up* You got this.</p>", "4344": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, yeah, Mr. Mark? When you were on the, uh, Wookiee home planet, how did you even understand what they were saying?<br/><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> I don't remember ever being on a Wookiee home planet.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Uh, actually, Luke was on the Wookiee home planet, Kashyyyk, in the Holiday Special when he helped Chewie get home to his wife.<br/><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> Chewie had a wife?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Her name's Malla.<br/><strong>Denise:</strong> Wow, that's impressive.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Yeah.</p>", "4345": "<p><strong>Georgie:</strong> Hey, uh, I got a question. Why aren't there tires on any of those Star Wars vehicles?<br/><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> (chuckles) I'm sure some of them had tires.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Actually, they don't. I mean, the HAVw A5 turbo tank has metal gripping wheels, but I wouldn't call them tires.<br/><strong>Denise:</strong> You are so hot.</p>", "4346": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What are you lunatics doing?!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon had a breakthrough.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Actually, Amy and I had a breakthrough.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, science? Shocking!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You don't understand. This could be really big.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, Penny's right. We have our whole lives to do science together.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Let's get married.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong>  All right. It's go time! I am pumped!</p>", "4347": "<p><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> Congratulations on your wedding.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you. When this is over, I have 4,000 things for you to sign.</p>", "4348": "<p><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> We're here to celebrate the marriage of Sheldon Lee Cooper and Amy Farrah Fowler. I had more prepared, but I'm just gonna skip to the rings and vows, since I've been answering your questions for 45 minutes.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Yeah, he answered 'em.</p>", "4349": "<p><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> Well, that was unexpectedly beautiful. (sniffles) I might need a minute.</p>", "4350": "<p><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> Do you (clears throat)- Do you-<br><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Hey, I'm just saying, I'm here if you need me to step in.<br/><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> No, no, no. I got this.</br></p>", "4351": "<p><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> Amy, do you take Sheldon for your lawful wedded husband?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I do.<br/><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> (high-pitched) And, Sheldon, same thing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I do.<br/><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> Then by the power vested in me by EvenYouCanPerformWeddings.com, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.</p>", "4352": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Boy, you know, when Sheldon sees you in that dress, he's gonna want to methodically take it off, fold it up, carefully place it in a storage box, label it, and then ravish you.</p>", "4353": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And look at the cool incentives I'm offering.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> \"For $50,000, I will examine your diet and create a customized bathroom schedule.\" That's fitting, 50 grand down the toilet.</p>", "4354": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, how about this? For $100,000, I will design the flag of your house or apartment. And for $1 million, I will come over and tell you what's wrong with you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aw, and all these years, I've been getting that for free.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't be smug, Leonard. That's one of the things that's wrong with you.</p>", "4355": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, you know, Penny's got a point. Sometimes when you want something big from someone, you-you got to be careful not to scare them away, you know? You got to start small and-and build up slowly, even if it takes eight years. Eight long years.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's oddly specific. Have you ever done that?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Nope.</p>", "4356": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> This is just to give you ideas. You know, do-do you want something simple and elegant? I mean, do you want a train?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> [entering the apartment] Ooh, we're talking about trains.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Not the kind of trains you like.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I like all kinds of trains: steam, diesel, coal, elevated, bullet. I defy you to name a train that I don't like.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> The kind on the back of a wedding dress?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I did not see that coming. Good job.</p>", "4357": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How much money are you asking for?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> $500 million.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Then I'd go no bra.</p>", "4358": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, they're not gonna give you half a billion dollars. I mean, they won't even give me that much and I keep promising I can make people's brains \"grow younger\".<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Can you?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (whispering) No. Shh.</p>", "4359": "<p><strong>Hostess:</strong> Would you like some champagne?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, thank you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thanks.<br/><strong>Hostess:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> This is nice.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What? Helping Amy find a dress or day drinking?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's just nice, okay?</p>", "4360": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Amy, oh, my God.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You look so beautiful.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I feel beautiful. And look, both clavicles. Take that, Mom.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You know what they say: if you got 'em, flaunt 'em.</p>", "4361": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Is it possible that the very first dress is the dress?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, don't be silly. You can't buy the first dress you try on. That'd be like marrying the first guy that you- You can't buy the first dress you try on.</p>", "4362": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong>  Uh, guys, we have a problem.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you okay?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What's wrong?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I look amazing in all of these dresses!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Wow. Look at your waist. Where you been hiding that thing?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (giggles) Bernadette, stop. Penny, you say something nice now.</p>", "4363": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you doing anything?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. I'm just sitting here at my desk typing on my computer for nothing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That was my guess, but I didn't want to assume.</p>", "4364": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Should we say something?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, we can't.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> But don't you think she brought us with her 'cause she wants our honest opinion?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No one wants that.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I do.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, ya don't.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't want her to look back and think she made some awful mistake.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You mean like your dumb Cookie Monster tattoo? See? Was that fun?</p>", "4365": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, Stuart, I'd like to sell some comic books.<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh. Well, I know all about that. Step one is flunk out of art school.</br></p>", "4366": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> How much do you need?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For a start, I'm trying to raise $500,000.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, I hope you have that rare Superman printed on the skin of actual Superman.</p>", "4367": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> All right, let's see what you got. Huh. Is this a complete run of Todd McFarlane's Spawn?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (gasps loudly) Yes.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Ooh, look at this. Giant-Size X-Men number one, Len Wein's relaunch of the franchise.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah. I know what it is. I'm the one who bought it, bagged it, boarded it and taped it shut while wearing white cotton gloves.</p>", "4368": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong>  Oh, did your mom pack your lunch?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (chuckles) Of course not. Do you know how much it costs to pack a tuna fish sandwich in dry ice and overnight it from Texas? Well, I do, and my mother says it's too expensive.</p>", "4369": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I like tuna fish.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you want it? I'll sell it to you for $5,000.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How's the fundraising going?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that depends. Raj, was that a \"yes\"?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's going badly.</p>", "4370": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ordinary people can't beat a casino, but mathematicians and scientists, they do it all the time. Yeah, a group of students from MIT took Las Vegas for millions, and that's MIT. Howard went there.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Come on, Sheldon. I'll give you a ride out to the desert right now.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong>  No one is going to Vegas.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, we weren't gonna make it to Vegas.</p>", "4371": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Anyway, who cares what I think?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I do. You're the-the coolest, prettiest, best-dressed person in my life.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, that would be flattering, except I know all the people in your life.</p>", "4372": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Anyone seen Sheldon?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Last time I saw Sheldon was this morning.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Careful. Don't say his name a third time.</p>", "4373": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, my God, this tomato is amazing! I can eat it like an apple.<br/><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> My secret is I fertilize it with my own manure.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The look on your face.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's a sort of grin. You want to know what kind?</p>", "4374": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I suppose we could pick a different date.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, it took you nine months to choose that one. I'll pick a different husband first.</p>", "4375": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm so proud of you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And I'm proud of you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because you can't tell how jealous I am?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, no, no. I can. But I can tell how hard you're trying to keep it in.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really hard.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm gonna go to bed.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, I'm gonna go scream on the roof.</p>", "4376": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, we've been married two years. Should we think about what's next? Like buying a house or having a baby?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, I want to do all those things someday, but there's a bunch of stuff I want to do first.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, like what?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't know, stay thin and have money.</p>", "4377": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Stuart, two questions: Do you have the new Aquaman, and do you mind if I use your back room to smoke some meat?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, since it's you asking, I'm gonna guess that's not a euphemism.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why are you smoking meat?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And why are you reading Aquaman?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am trying to make Amy a historically accurate Little House on the Prairie dinner for her birthday, and I want to be able to say I was reading it before it was cool.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wow, well, that's actually really sweet.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The dinner thing. The Aquaman thing's dumb.</p>", "4378": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? Is this still happening?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm willing to make up, but someone's being a baby.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ooh! I do love a riddle. Oh, let me see. See, my first guess would be Halley, but that'd be strange to accuse her of being a baby 'cause she is a baby. Um, I suppose it could be Stuart; his head does have a certain milky scent.</p>", "4379": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You're a grown man; act like it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Big talk coming from a guy holding an Archie comic book.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, werewolf Jughead is not your dad's Jughead.</p>", "4380": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Come on, you guys have been friends forever. Quit fighting.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> I have an extra ticket to the opening of The Last Jedi tonight. It was gonna be Howard's, but you can have it.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> You two had a good run.</br></p>", "4381": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, who wants to go see Last Jedi again tonight?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Mm, I'm in.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Me, too. It'll be nice to see the parts I missed while I was blinking.</p>", "4382": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, that's enough. This fight either has to end or get way more entertaining.</p>", "4383": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Great. Can you bring a few things?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Sure. What do you need?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Balloons, streamers, ice, snacks, a bounce house, face painter, and a couple kids whose parents are willing to lie and say they know me from the Daddy and Me class I've never been to.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Where do you and Halley go every week?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The important thing is we're together, and if the movie gets too violent, I cover her eyes.</p>", "4384": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I hope you're hungry.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, I'm starving.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, good. Starvation is authentic to the time period. If you also have malaria and a deep distrust of Native Americans, we're really cooking with a woodstove.</p>", "4385": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I've decided to write my own Christmas letter. So I'm gonna make a list of all the cool things we did this year.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, fun. Can I help?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes. Can you think of a single cool thing we did this year?</p>", "4386": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, well, both of our jobs are going great.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure. I mean, my Air Force project got taken away, and you're not crazy about selling pharmaceuticals. I'll just write down \"still employed.\"</p>", "4387": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, we had our second anniversary.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, yeah, but we did kind of forget about it, so maybe just write \"still married.\"</p>", "4388": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Let's look at our pictures; that-that'll jog our memories.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What is that a picture of?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, uh, that's a mole on my back. I wanted to make sure it wasn't growing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> How'd you get a picture of your own back?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon took it. We're kind of mole buddies.</p>", "4389": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, that's a cute picture. Isn't that the day we almost went to the beach?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Memorial Day?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, that was the day we almost went to the mountains.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh. That's the great thing about California; you can almost go to the mountains and almost go to the beach in the same day.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah.</p>", "4390": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Are you gonna help me or not?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, I will not help you. (sighs) But I will help Halley. She's my goddaughter, and I love her. And I have a lot of party favors left over from Cinnamon's birthday, so I hope she likes things that squeak when you chew on them.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sh-She's a human being, not an animal. But that actually would be a hit.</p>", "4391": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I think I'm just gonna go over here and sit on the couch.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, great. Then we will move on to stage two: the pitching of woo.</p>", "4392": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Should I read you some bawdy 19th century limericks?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (chuckles) Okay.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, here. \"There once was a priest from Terre Haute who purchased a sheep and a goat\"<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hold on a second. Is it getting hot in here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I didn't even get to the dirty part yet.</p>", "4393": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> How you two feeling?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, a little better. Those books should have been called Little Outhouse on the Prairie.</p>", "4394": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know it's still your birthday.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (chuckles) It is.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And we are both feeling better.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> We are. And there's no one in that bounce house.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Great. Let's go jump for a bit, and then find a bedroom to have coitus in.</p>", "4395": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I think you'd be great at that. Don't you agree, Bernadette?<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Huh? I'm listening. I'm listening. I'm not watching The Crown.</br></p>", "4396": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We've assigned all wedding decisions randomly, and each of us makes half of them. You know, from venue to officiant to numbering system for the tables: Roman or Dewey Decimal.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why not hexadecimal?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> 'Cause this is our wedding, not a joke.</p>", "4397": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait. The premise is that he is dressed differently?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (laughing) That's true. He is not dressed the same.</p>", "4398": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, this is really fun. I can't believe that people say that planning a wedding is one of the most stressful things in life.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know. Not a day goes by that I don't marvel how much better we are than other people.</p>", "4399": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Have you ever thought about talking to some kind of therapist about all this?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ugh. Maybe. Hey, Leonard, do you think your mom would be available?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, you don't want to do that. Talking to my mom to get more confidence is like talking to a lion to get more alive.</p>", "4400": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well if the ushers are so important to you, what if I propose a trade? You may pick that, and I will decide, say, first dance.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Great. Then the ushers will be my cousins dressed in frontier frock coats.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. And the first dance will be that we won't have one.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> All right. Then our second dance will be the first dance.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Unless we have no dance at all.</p>", "4401": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> And if we're not enjoying planning this wedding, then what's the point?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, historically, a wedding was to let other potential suitors know that we're unavailable. But I think matching T-shirts that say \"Hands off the merchandise\" accomplish the same thing.</p>", "4402": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Tomorrow we'll go downtown and get married.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Or we could go to Beverly Hills City Hall if you want a destination wedding.</p>", "4403": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hey, Howard.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Where is everybody?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I could ask you the same question.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Wow, this conversation got mean fast.</p>", "4404": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I mean, your life's a mess. I don't see you blaming other people for it.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> That's right. I grew up in a loving, supportive household. This is all on me.</p>", "4405": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You and Amy having fun planning your wedding?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We're employing a mathematical approach called decision theory, so, heck, yeah.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Heck, yeah? Looks like someone need to put a dollar in the almost-swear jar.</p>", "4406": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> They asked me what my biggest weakness was, and 45 minutes later, they thanked me for coming.</p>", "4407": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Speaking of something I find interesting, did anyone read that article about Bitcoin I sent you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, I can't believe a single Bitcoin is worth about $5,000 now.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait, didn't we mine some a few years ago?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It was seven years ago.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, yeah, I remember that.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really? All I can remember from seven years ago is I couldn't get Kesha's \"Tik Tok\" out of my head.<br/>\n\"Tik Tok, on the clock\" Whoa, welcome home, Kesha.</p>", "4408": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> If it's not tangible, how do you know it's not just gonna vanish tomorrow?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really? You're dating Penny, and you're gonna poke at something that could vanish tomorrow?</p>", "4409": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, Stuart. You want to mine some Bitcoin with us? We'll write the program, you bring the snacks?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Too rich for my blood.</p>", "4410": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, yeah. We did it without you.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And do you remember what happened next?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Your mom called my mom and said we were being mean?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And after that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You said that someday we'd regret this.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And do you know what today is?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The day we found out we're rich and none of it is yours? (Leonard, Howard and Raj high-five)</br></p>", "4411": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Mining for coins sounds so manly. Ooh, we should sing a mining song.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you know a mining song?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know. Does \"Tik Tok\" by Kesha count? Because it has tunneled its way into my heart.</p>", "4412": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, weddings aren't about the location. They're about standing up in front of your family and friends and promising that Sheldon will never move back in here.</p>", "4413": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey. What are you guys doing?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, we have a bunch of Bitcoin on an old laptop, and it could be worth, like, a lot of money.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What-- You're kidding.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. We-we could be sitting on a fortune.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, let the record show, I did not marry you for money, but you just got way more attractive.</p>", "4414": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You guys ready to order?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Can you take our picture, please?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, sure. Smile! Perfect.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Thank you. (To her date) You may go now. It was nice to meet you, and I mean that politely, not sincerely.</p>", "4415": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What was that?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I need to prove to my mother that I'm on a date. If she thinks I faked the picture, I might need you as a witness. What's your name?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Bernadette.</p>", "4416": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know what, if you need a computer, you can use my laptop.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's sweet, but I'm not gonna take your computer.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, it's fine. I-I'm getting a new one anyway.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you sure?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't be silly. He's desperate to hold on to you. You can get anything out of him. His car, his watch-<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe a kidney. You already have his testicles. You can start a collection.</p>", "4417": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, my God, that's right. You gave me your laptop. That was so sweet.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So you know where it is?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Of course.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Great!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> All right!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I gave it to my ex-boyfriend Zack.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why?!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Come on!</p>", "4418": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can't believe you took a gift from me and gave it to another man.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? Of all the things she's given to other men, that's what you're concerned about?</p>", "4419": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, Penny and I aren't the only ones who've broken up. So did Howard and Bernadette.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, not to brag, but all my breakups have lasted.</p>", "4420": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hello, Leonard. I was gonna write you an e-mail, but I'm a little drunk, and spelling is a sober person's game, so I feel I owe you a 'splanation. I-- I'm sorry. A 'splanation.</p>", "4421": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, that documentary last night was actually better than I thought it would be.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? Should've been about Samuel Morse the way they telegraphed that ending.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I already pretended to laugh at that joke once. Do I have to do it again?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, I'd appreciate it. (chuckles)<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (forced laugh) Samuel Morse. You kill me.</p>", "4422": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, can you drive me to work?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, sure. Oh, hey, the guys and I were talking about going to see the Tesla coil at the observatory later on, if you want to join.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why? What are you doing? <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard, what are you doing? He said he can't go. Make a sad face, move on.</p>", "4423": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's the greatest scientific feud of all time. I mean, you can forget about Leibniz and Newton.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Done.</p>", "4424": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, what are you two doing here?<br/><strong>Ruchi:</strong> We won't stay long. I just wanted to drop something off from me and the girls at work.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> None of the girls at work like me enough to get me a gift.<br/><strong>Ruchi:</strong> Okay, so you'll know why everyone at the office has the same handwriting.</p>", "4425": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, Tesla's the one that invented the electric car?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (laughs) No, Penny. No, the car is just named after him.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, you don't have to be so smug about it. You know, you went to see that movie It because you thought it was about scary I.T. guys.</br></p>", "4426": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know whose fault this is?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I do. Yours.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, my mother's. \"Go make friends, Sheldon.\" What happens? 20 years later, they call me names.</p>", "4427": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't think what they called you is the point here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, yeah? How would you feel if I called you the name of a neuroscientist you didn't like?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you know the name of any neuroscientist?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Not me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Then no.</p>", "4428": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you think they're right, Amy? Do you think I'm like Edison?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I don't think you're upset because of what kind of scientist they said you're like. I think you're upset because your friends' feelings got hurt.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're right. I care too much about other people's feelings. It's always been my fatal flaw.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I don't think-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, no, not now, Amy. I'm growing as a person.</p>", "4429": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Ah, that was fun. Put her there, buddy.<br/><strong>Ruchi:</strong> I am not fist bumping you after we have sex.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You're the one who wanted to keep things casual.<br/><strong>Ruchi:</strong> There's a difference between casual and weird.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Not the way I do it.</p>", "4430": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I want you to know, I did what you asked. I talked to Ruchi and found out what's going on at work.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So is she trying to steal my projects?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, not trying to, sounds like it's a done deal. Here, have a brownie.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm gonna kill her.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, don't take this out on Ruchi. Is she trying to take your job? Yes. Is she parking in your space? Yes.<br/>\nDid she get a laugh at a meeting yesterday by calling you \"Pregnadette\"? Big one. But you would've done the exact same thing, and you know it.</p>", "4431": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Can we start the movie? Before Sheldon gets here?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Last time we did that, he didn't talk to us for a month. So do it!</p>", "4432": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Edison was kind of a publicity hog and a bully.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, he electrocuted an elephant named Topsy just to make himself famous. If I had an elephant named Topsy, he would want for nothing. Also, he'd be named Jumbo.</p>", "4433": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, this is about science. Why'd you come to me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, because it's also about my reputation. And somehow you manage to hold your head high despite your checkered past.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Checkered past?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's a figure of speech referring to how sexually promiscuous you were.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? Well, I've got a figure of speech about how sexually promiscuous you can go be with yourself.</p>", "4434": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Well, you know, we geologists always get a little sad when Rocktober's over.</p>", "4435": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So Ruchi and I decided to keep things casual.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (scoffs)<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What? What? I can handle casual.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (scoffs)<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, why do you keep doing that with your face?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Because you keep saying stupid things with yours.</p>", "4436": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> I'm not asking you to play rocks. I'm asking you to collaborate on a research project. Although, if there's time, I guess we could play a round of zinc, zinc, piece of quartz.</p>", "4437": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't get how you can enjoy cricket. It makes no sense.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Did you just come here to complain?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah. That's the sport of my people.</p>", "4438": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm working with Bert, but I don't want anyone to find out.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, you just told me, so strong start.</p>", "4439": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am a respected theoretical physicist. I aspire to win a Nobel Prize someday. But nobody's gonna take me seriously if they find out I've been dabbling in geology.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, why not? They're both sciences. And I know because they're classes my high school counselor said \"weren't for me.\"</p>", "4440": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Look, while Bernadette's on bed rest, we're gonna have to divide and conquer. I've got one monitor for her, one for the baby. Which do you want?<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'll take the baby. She's less emasculating.</br></p>", "4441": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, when do you see her next?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, we're having dinner tonight.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, put a rubber band around your wrist, and any time you start planning your wedding or naming your children, I want you to stab yourself in the hand with a fork.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What's the rubber band for?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> To slow the bleeding.</p>", "4442": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Sheldon, you left your jacket in my office last night.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, oh. No-no, I didn't. That's-that's not my jacket.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Then why does it say, \"Property of S. Cooper. Stop touching it.\"?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It sounds like someone named Scooper doesn't want you touching his jacket.</p>", "4443": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, you've never cared what people thought, even when you really, really should. That dinner with my parents comes to mind.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If I'm not gonna use \"your momma\" jokes when I meet your mother, why'd I bother to learn them?</p>", "4444": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm just saying, if you think the work is interesting, nothing else should matter.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're right, Amy. That is sage advice. Which is surprising, considering your momma is so dumb, she-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (Gets up and leaves) Nope.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (After Amy's gone) She studied for a urine test. (chuckles)</p>", "4445": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> What do you want, Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I would like us to work together again. I promise to keep my geology comments to myself, because while some of them are funny, all of them are mean.</p>", "4446": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, Sheldon, you were a jerk to Bert, and he walked away from you. So I feel like there's a lot he could teach me.</p>", "4447": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So how was your night with Ruchi?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, great. We ordered in some food, we had sex, I left. I didn't even ask if she enjoyed it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (chuckles) I can field that one for her.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I mean, I did get a little misty when we said good-bye, but I played it off as allergies. I don't know if she bought it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Again, I know.</p>", "4448": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, Arthur.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> What-what part of \"rest in peace\" don't you understand?</p>", "4449": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I suppose you're here because you heard the news?<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Sheldon, I'm a figment of your imagination. I don't hear news.</p>", "4450": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're a grumpy figment. Look, they're remaking your show, and they cast Wil Wheaton as Professor Proton. And the worst part is, he's not even a scientist.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> No, the-the worst part is, I'm sitting on a moist log.</p>", "4451": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You can't be Professor Proton. You're not a scientist.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Well, I was never on a starship, but pretending I was bought me this house. And if I'd pretended a little longer, it would have a swimming pool.</p>", "4452": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie, slow down.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I can't. I'm not allowed to eat for 12 hours before my surgery, and I only got two more minutes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What surgery are you having?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm stress eating. My best friend's getting a vasectomy tomorrow.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And you're sad you won't be able to bear his child?</p>", "4453": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, you ready?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, almost. I'm working on my facial expressions. See, uh, I've got interested. Hmm.<br/>\nI've got very interested. Hmm.<br/>\nOh, and, uh, enraged.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why would you be enraged?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it.</p>", "4454": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, what do you think?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I already told him that I loved it, but if you found it confusing or dangerous or, I don't know, three to four times too long, now is the time to share.</p>", "4455": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, you can always reshoot it.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mm, I suppose. And, you know, maybe I could even get some tips from someone who's acted professionally.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. Sheldon, obviously, I'd be happy to help you out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know what to say.</br></p>", "4456": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, how was the doctor?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Good, but I have some news.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't say twins. Don't say twins. Don't say twins. Don't say twins.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's not twins.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. I mean, because I would have loved them both.</p>", "4457": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I thought Raj was helping you out.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, he had to work. Plus, he has a quota for the amount of Indian servant jokes he can tolerate, and, apparently, I filled it.</p>", "4458": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Would you ever get a vasectomy?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, in case you haven't noticed, Indians aren't too big on birth control. There's probably, like, a million more of us since we started this conversation.</p>", "4459": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What about tiresome lunatic with a bad haircut? Has he called yet?</p>", "4460": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Come on. How many times have we banded together to try to save a show that we loved? Let's shake things up and try to kill one.</p>", "4461": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Isn't the important thing that there's a show to get kids excited about science?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who cares about kids and what they like? This is about me and something I liked when ... when I was a kid.</p>", "4462": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What if the reboot is great?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's even worse. If-if I like it, I'll feel like I'm being disloyal to Arthur. He was a mentor and a friend, and I won't toss him aside for some Hollywood pretty boy like Wil Wheaton.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's hard to argue with him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because he makes no sense? Yeah.</p>", "4463": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Sheldon, I promise that I will work my hardest to make this show great so that a whole new generation of kids will grow up and they will be able to say that Professor Proton was the reason they got into science.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wow, that was very persuasive.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Thanks.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I won't be seduced by your acting skills nor your movie star charisma. There's only one Professor Proton, and he had neither of those things.</p>", "4464": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll give you one more chance to bow out.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Or what?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When we first met, we were enemies, but we worked through that and we became friends. Do you really want to go back?<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Honestly, it doesn't feel very different.</p>", "4465": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Can you get us a little snack?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You sure you don't want your spy to do it?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What are you talking about?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You really don't trust me? You had to have Amy stop by?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We trust you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah. You were a terrible waitress, and we still asked you to get us a snack.</p>", "4466": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Auntie Penny's here. Shh. Let's get you changed. Your mommy and daddy say they trust me, but they're full of the same stuff your diaper is.</p>", "4467": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So this is it?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes. We are using it to map brain wave patterns and then converting them into electrical impulses that can be used to control anything from wheelchairs to robots.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Based on that ring on your finger, I'd say you're pretty good at controlling robots.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Careful, that's my fiance you're talking about. And I can program him to hurt you.</p>", "4468": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What's with the blinking?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's Morse code. So we can talk about without hurting --'s feelings.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I don't know Morse code.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I do. And if you have something to say, you can say it to my face.</p>", "4469": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ahh, Sheldon's texting me to drive him to Bernadette's.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, what are you gonna say?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, they did just introduce the middle finger emoji. If it's not for this, I don't know what it's for.</p>", "4470": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Maybe there's something in the book that will help.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Worth a shot.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay. Let's see, let's see. \"Biting other children\"?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, sometimes, but problem for another day.</br></p>", "4471": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, what are you working on?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, my God, you're still here?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, of course I'm here. I know what you're going through.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Really? You have a needy Indian man in your house?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I did, but then he came over here.</p>", "4472": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Did you do the laundry?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I sure did. Ooh, he's gonna be steamed. Just like his dress shirts.</p>", "4473": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What makes you think you can treat me like a child?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Your shampoo comes in a Big Bird bottle.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's because the adult shampoo burns my man eyes.</p>", "4474": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, that's Sheldon. Oh, he's upset with Leonard and Penny. (phone whooshes) And Bernadette. (phone whooshes) And Mark Twain?</p>", "4475": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, she's nine months old, so unless it jingles or is in my bra, she doesn't care.</p>", "4476": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Like, what'd you do last night?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I had Cuban food at the home of a man with whom I shared unsatisfying intercourse.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow. Okay.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> And to anticipate your next questions, roasted pork and sideways missionary.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sure. Sure. 'Cause you were full.</p>", "4477": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Then why don't you ever drive yourself?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Honestly, I barely passed my test. And the one time I drove on my own, I made a U-turn, got dizzy, threw up and walked home.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You really want to drive?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It seems like the perfect time. The roads are straight, there's no one around, and you don't seem to care if you live or die.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Live, Sheldon. I want to live.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That makes things a little trickier, but I'll do my best.</p>", "4478": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, I barely know how to be a man myself. Now I have to teach someone?\n<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, as the saying goes, those who can't, teach.</p>", "4479": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> It feels like it wasn't that long ago we were here doing this for Halley.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> 'Cause it wasn't. Which reminds me, before we leave, let's get you a vasectomy.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, that's sweet, but today is all about you.</p>", "4480": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Don't you want a little version of Howard?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I already have a little version of Howard.</p>", "4481": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You know what? Forget the past. What do you say you and me build this rocket?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That sounds like it could be a real bonding experience for us.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Right?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I see. Oh, you think that's a positive.</p>", "4482": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Okay, how about we flip a coin?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, hang on. Doesn't this girl get a word in all of this? And isn't that word \"no\"?</p>", "4483": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you sure that's what you want?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As sure as I'm about to go bathe in Purell.</p>", "4484": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm just saying that my research may actually change the world forever.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I hope it does. 'Cause I'm going to see that world from a yacht so big you could land a helicopter on it!</p>", "4485": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I've got something. I'm being interviewed on public radio this Friday.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, cool. How come?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, the university is trying to get more funding for the physics department, so they want me to go out and talk it up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? You? (Amy whispers to Sheldon) Well, they picked the right person for the job.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (To Amy) I think he bought it.</br></p>", "4486": "<p><strong>Ira Flatow:</strong> Hi, I'm Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday. Joining me today is my guest physicist, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, to talk about all of the exciting research they're doing at Cal Tech.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you for having me. Whoa (chuckles) Could never get used to hearing myself in headphones. Is that really how I sound?<br/><strong>Ira Flatow:</strong> (chuckles) It is. It is.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (deep voice): That is good to know.</p>", "4487": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, just tell me what I can do.<br/><strong>Ms. Davis:</strong> I'm gonna need you to make a statement saying that you misspoke, and that you're confident the physics community is close to a major breakthrough.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You want me to lie.<br/><strong>Ms. Davis:</strong> Look, Dr. Hofstadter, I'm counting on you. I think that you are the smartest physicist at this university.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Ms. Davis:</strong> See? Lies. They're not that hard.</p>", "4488": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look, not all science pans out. You know, we've been hoping super-symmetry was true for decades, and finally, we built the Large Hadron Collider, which is supposed to prove it by finding these new particles, and it-it hasn't. And maybe super-symmetry, our last big idea, is simply wrong.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, that sounds awful. Now I get why everyone hates me.</p>", "4489": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, but I do have several bottles of Romulan ale that I bought at Comic-Con.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Isn't that just vodka with blue dye in it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> First, physics, now Romulan ale. What else would you like to defecate on?</p>", "4490": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, I thought you were coming right back.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I was, but we're both depressed, and decided to drown our sorrows.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> With mouthwash? Man, that is so summer camp.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's Romulan ale, from Star Trek.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It was briefly legalized during the alliance between the Romulan Empire and the Federation at the time of the Dominion War.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aw, now I'm depressed.</p>", "4491": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You know, you're a successful woman. You should be able to brag about your accomplishments once in a while.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, so should you. I mean, the guys are never shy about bragging.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Tell me about it. Howie texts me every time his dog levels up in Warcraft.</p>", "4492": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So you guys are upset because the collider thing disproved your theories?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's worse than that. It hasn't found anything in years, so we don't know if we're right, we don't know if we're wrong. We don't know where to go next.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All I know is it looks like I tongue-kissed Avatar.</p>", "4493": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, we don't need to be cheered up. It just turns out that physics is exactly like Lost. Started out great, and turns out just a big old waste of time.</p>", "4494": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I came here to propose. If you'd said no, I wouldn't want to stick around looking at your stupid face.<br/>\nNow, mind you, your face is only stupid in the \"no\" version of the story.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> But I said yes, so I get a lifetime of this.</p>", "4495": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We're engaged.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, my God, that's amazing! Wait, uh, tell me everything.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, Dr. Nowitzki was kissing me-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, you can stop leading with that part of the story.</p>", "4496": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> This wasn't supposed to happen. We were careful.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I didn't even think you could get pregnant while you were breastfeeding.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, guess what? You can!</p>", "4497": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Look at Nowitzki over there.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can't believe she tried to steal Sheldon from Amy.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You know what? I'm gonna go there and tell her that they're engaged now and that her little plan didn't work.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Because you're sticking up for Sheldon, or because you're still mad she rejected you?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Too far away, can't hear you.</p>", "4498": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, Stuart.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, hey, Raj. What can I help you with?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I need to buy an engagement gift.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, well, you came to the wrong place.</p>", "4499": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> But then we realized that it's a gift, in the sense that we didn't ask for it, and we may not have chosen it-<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And we already have one.</p>", "4500": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, so, Ramona, tell us about yourself. Do you, do you have a boyfriend?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, your wife is sitting right here. What are you doing?</br></p>", "4501": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Do you think living with Amy has somehow stirred up Sheldon's sexual appetite?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (grimacing with disgust) Ugh. How can you think that? Why would you even put those words together?</p>", "4502": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Where are you moving?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And when? But a-also where?</p>", "4503": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're so kind. You know, I don't know how I ever got by without you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh. That's sweet, but you you did just fine on your own.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I thought that, too, but I've come to realize, I am completely dependent on you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, you're, you're being silly.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, to wake up every morning and know you're there is a great comfort to me. (Eats oatmeal) Mmm, tasteless. How do you do it?</p>", "4504": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, what you need to do is put this Air Force project behind you and just dive into something new.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, there is our quantum cognition experiment. You and I could spend more time on that.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, I don't know, I mean, let's say we succeed in proving that our consciousness creates reality.<br/>\nI mean, what will we have really accomplished? You know, a loaf of bread's still three bucks.</p>", "4505": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, listen to me. Your relationship can handle being long distance for a while. It's not like you two are very physical.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, you don't know what goes on behind closed doors.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> A lot of lectures?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> All right, so you know.</p>", "4506": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I really can't thank you enough for taking me in. You know, I was in a pretty low place in my life, and-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (from across the hall) Oh, Amy, you naughty vixen.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Anyway, uh, as I was saying, I was at a pretty low place in my life and, uh, if it wasn't for friends like you-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (from across the hall) My goodness, that form of stimulation is highly efficient.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I can't compete with that.</p>", "4507": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Should we give them their privacy?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I want to, but I don't think I can.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (from across the hall) Whoopee!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, I'm good now.</p>", "4508": "<p>(Howard and Raj sing while playing the keyboards and guitar, respectively)<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wondering how it all began?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You'll need a good attention span-<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> For information and entertainment-<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's equally effective-<br/><strong>Both:</strong> It's Fun with Flags - Behind the Flags: A Retrospective. Flags!</p>", "4509": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Now, I'm sure many of you are wondering how Fun with Flags began.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So let's hear from some people who were there at the very start. Howard, flashback sounds.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Could have played that on my harp.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just roll the clip.</p>", "4510": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So tell us in your own words about that magical moment when Fun with Flags was born.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I honestly don't remember.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sure you do. I was telling you both the story about how Haiti and Lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag. It was at the Summer Olympics of 1936, and two plucky nations-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, wait. I remember.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, and do you remember what you said?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes. \"Please find someone who cares.\"<br/>\n*cut back to Sheldon and Amy in the \"studio\"*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And that's exactly what I did. I found a lot of someones.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Almost 200. Many of them on purpose.</p>", "4511": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I haven't had much success meeting people online.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> I didn't either, until I revamped my profile.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What'd you do, delete your photo?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Go.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And don't you slam that door.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aw, man.</p>", "4512": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm sorry, Bert, but aren't you worried she's only with you for your money?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> She better be. On our first date, I bought her an 80-inch flat-screen.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Your first date? Did you even measure her walls?</p>", "4513": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, sorry if last night was awkward.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Actually, it got me thinking that I shouldn't flaunt my money to find love. I might break up with Rebecca.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wow, that's a big step.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I think it shows a lot of character.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> I'm gonna hold out and see if I can find a hot young blonde who likes me for me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (laughs) That's a good one. Okay, now, Leonard, you tell a joke.</p>", "4514": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, I mean, with you and my parents, she's gonna be fine.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Ah, of course she is.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> And that day care is great.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> It is. I went to check it out, and they are very cautious about letting strange men with no kids peek in the windows.</p>", "4515": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you getting sick?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course not. I'm too busy to be sick.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, you're pretty delicate. Maybe you shouldn't be pushing yourself so hard.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm fine.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All right. We'll just pretend that you didn't catch a cold watching Frozen.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That didn't happen.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You also got a nosebleed watching Up.</br></p>", "4516": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why did you tell Leonard you're working on the gyroscope tomorrow?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because I am.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> But you said you were working with me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh-oh, someone's got two dates to the nerd prom.</p>", "4517": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Look, Raj just gets along with women.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know, but he was my friend first. It's like she's stealing him and they're just having the best time doing all their dumb girly stuff together.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You sure you don't fit in? You sound like a catty bitch to me.</p>", "4518": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Now You've recently moved in with Dr. Fowler, yes?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Clearly, your old room represents an escape hatch, and without it, you're forced to confront the terrifying reality of being trapped in a relationship with Amy forever.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I hadn't thought about that.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And don't start thinking about it now!<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Hello, Amy. Your defensiveness may indicate similar insecurities about your relationship with Sheldon.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's not true!<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> She said defensively.</p>", "4519": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, Raj, I owe you an apology. Look, could you please put your dog on a leash?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon, she's fine.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, then at least hold her still so I can pretend she's stuffed.</p>", "4520": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, and FYI, if you cry while they're fighting they'll take you to McDonald's.</p>", "4521": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Beverly believes I unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Is that bothering you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. I don't care for unconscious thoughts. My brain and I are best friends. It should tell me everything.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I mean, how it relates to our relationship, not the bromance between you and your brain.</p>", "4522": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I spoke with Leonard's mother, and she made me feel better.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know who you talked to, but that wasn't my mother.</p>", "4523": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sounds like everyone's staying home. What do you say?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nuts to that, I'm going to Comic-Con!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> By yourself?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not necessarily. I have four months to find some new friends.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'll go with you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's very kind of you, Stuart. Check back in with me in July.</p>", "4524": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's my pretty girlfriend.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm not going with you to Comic-Con.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What? Can't a man just be happy to see his woman and pat her on her second most erogenous ball-and-socket joint?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> He can, but it's still not changing my mind.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, maybe what's in my pants will change your mind. It's a list of this year's panelists. It's long, isn't it?</p>", "4525": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm not sleeping on the couch 'cause you don't know what's private and what's not.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This isn't fair. You've discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's different! She's a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That lady has a name. I don't know what it is, but one time, I accidentally called her \"Mom\".</p>", "4526": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course you're fine. Not every member of a species finds a mate. Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin. Look at the contributions he made.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm not a virgin, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wha- So now you think you're better than Isaac Newton?</p>", "4527": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Is it normal for the husband to kind of completely stop giving a crap?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Uh-oh, what's going on?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, Leonard used to do all these things, like bring me flowers and wear pants.</p>", "4528": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, got to get her hooked on TV, or someday, she'll want me to play outside.</p>", "4529": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> She would've been the best grandma.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> She did always have candy in her pocket.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah. I was 20 years old before I figured out Tootsie Rolls weren't naturally warm.</p>", "4530": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What's wrong?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not sure. Earlier tonight, things began organically, and now it's feeling forced, like all the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels.</br></p>", "4531": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I believe we were kissing like randy teenagers, and your nose was whistling ever so slightly.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm sorry.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, don't be. You were like a foxy tea kettle.</p>", "4532": "<p><strong>Althea:</strong> Sweetheart, go home. Come back when the contractions are five minutes apart for an hour.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm sorry. That's ambiguous. Is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour, or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction, so essentially, like, 65 minutes?<br/><strong>Althea:</strong> I'm just throwing this out there, but home births are very popular these days.</p>", "4533": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How could you?!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We made it this far without knowing, and you ruined it!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, you guys have no idea how hard it is to know something like this and not say it!<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> You told me it was a girl, and I didn't say it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Raj!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You were supposed to keep that to yourself.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, yeah. I guess it is hard.</p>", "4534": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Everything is stupid and I want to go home.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's Sheldon's way of saying he's proud of Bert, too.</p>", "4535": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, Sheldon, maybe if you take the time to actually read Bert's research, you'd be less bitter about him winning.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You want me to read a geology paper?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Honestly, I just want you to be quiet, but I'm all out of taffy.</p>", "4536": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh my god, I just got it. Fun onions. Funyuns. Hahahaha!</p>", "4537": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I can't believe I'm saying this, but can we watch the news or something?</p>", "4538": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You'll have nerds fawning all over you. If you don't love that, this marriage is in trouble.</p>", "4539": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> It's okay, I'll still go.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You don't think you'll be bored?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I'll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap I don't understand. I mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I won't be there.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look at that, it is a party!</p>", "4540": "<p><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Look, guys, it's just a guidance system. It's not like you're handing us the Death Star from Star Trek.</p>", "4541": "<p><strong>Susan:</strong> All right, that's enough jail talk.<br/><strong>Randall:</strong> Penny knows where I was; she sent me cigarettes.<br/><strong>Susan:</strong> You sent your brother cigarettes?<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> He was cooking and selling crystal meth, Susan. I think we can let the cigarettes slide.</p>", "4542": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Fine, if you really want me to, I will pick your mom up.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Seriously?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law and I'd like for us to have a good relationship.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That is very mature of you. So I'm gonna go ahead and say, suckah.</p>", "4543": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, back to learning.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, easy. Bill Nye the Science Guy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Or as I know him?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.</p>", "4544": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now, let's follow in that brave woman's footsteps, and stand up for ourselves. And, and I realize that she stood up by remaining seated, but now is not the time to enjoy the irony of that. Now, I ask you again. Who here takes issue with this person?<br/><strong>Woman:</strong> Why should we listen to you? You cut the line yourself.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I most certainly did not.<br/><strong>Woman:</strong> I saw you.<br/><strong>Guy:</strong> If you're feeling dizzy, it's because the tables have turned.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me, I paid someone to wait in line for me, and then when I arrived, he left, so what you saw, my good woman, was swapsies, not cutsies.</p>", "4545": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You really think we made a mistake?<br><strong>Beverly:</strong> At the time I did. But I've never seen Leonard so happy, so perhaps I was wrong.</br></p>", "4546": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, we're out. Bernie can't drink 'cause she's pregnant. And she's pregnant because we had sex. And we had sex because, well, (points to his body) come on.</p>", "4547": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, Claire.<br/><strong>Claire:</strong> Hey, what's up?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hi, yeah. Um, I was wondering, if you're free Saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting.<br/><strong>Claire:</strong> Sure, I guess. If you don't think meeting your friends is too big a step.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why would it be too big a step?<br/><strong>Claire:</strong> I don't know. I just don't want things to get weird.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time, and it isn't weird. I met Bon Jovi once, which you'd think might be weird. Turns out, total sweetheart.<br/><strong>Claire:</strong> Okay, but you and I have been keeping things casual. Uh, will you introduce me as your friend or as your girlfriend? What if I like them and they don't like me? What if they like me and I don't like them?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Boy, it wasn't this hard with Bon Jovi. I said you rock, he said \"Thanks, man,\" and that was that.</p>", "4548": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey. Where is everybody?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, we're the first ones here.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, cool.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yeah, cool.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, I don't remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, I do. It was three years ago.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, yeah, and we said we should do it more often. And, and, and, and here we are.</p>", "4549": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm getting an earthy note.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ah, there's definitely some oak.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Also, uh, cherries?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I smell nothing.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really? Nothing?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just a whole lot of Afrin.</p>", "4550": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And last but not least, this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because it has a light side and a dark side. All righty, it's time for Dungeons &amp; Dragons.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Dungeons &amp; Dragons? That sounds about right.</p>", "4551": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, that's Claire. Got to run.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I thought you were back with Emily.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, actually I'm seeing both of them.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You mean like through their window from behind a bush?</p>", "4552": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What, why did you get a party sub?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> People are coming over, it looked fun.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, we're only watching Game of Thrones. A party sub implies it's a party.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Your attendance implies its not.</p>", "4553": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course, this will require a vote. Unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom, but luckily I have my travel gavel.</p>", "4554": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Man, I'm worn out.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I know. Imagine if we were actually moving.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, it's just, ever since I started dating Claire and Emily at the same time, it's exhausting.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're exhausted? Try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you've read it.</p>", "4555": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, how's the mommy-to-be?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Good. A little tired.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I feel you. I've been dating multiple women.</p>", "4556": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You sure you don't want to come watch Game of Thrones with us?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You guys have fun. I'm just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, that sounds great, a bed to yourself. Can't even remember what that's like.</p>", "4557": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh-oh, somebody's still pouting.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Leave me alone.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> If it's because you lost a stick, I know where it went.</p>", "4558": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I know how he feels. I never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait. You were pretending?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sorry.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. I don't believe you. I could tell.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (feigning excitement) Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm, what do you think?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You don't know?</p>", "4559": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, come on, Raj.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She did.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And I'm gonna eat it all!</p>", "4560": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So what the hell happened?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldon's nonsense.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Tell me about it. I've had it with Raj, too.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. Dips in testosterone can cause irritability.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Interesting. Maybe my male cycle synced up with Raj's actual period.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If Sheldon's testosterone dipped, he'd become a butterfly.</br></p>", "4561": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I just took your side 'cause sometimes I get annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, they argue all the time. They aren't that close.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Whos always comforting him when he's upset?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny, but-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Who's the only one who can make him take his medicine when he's sick?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out.</p>", "4562": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, well, then you'll enjoy this. Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, she doesn't.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She defends him all the time.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She does not.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Who told you to stop making all those Gandhi jokes about him?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, she did. And human resources.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Who do you think told Koothrappali to go to human resources?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Son of a bitch.</p>", "4563": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Amy, why did you tell him that?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Because you were defending Sheldon like you always do.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't always defend Sheldon.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, yes, you do. You know you have a weird brother-sister / Elliott - E.T. relationship with him.</p>", "4564": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It just said Italian sub. I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Interesting fact, in Italian, the morta in mortadella means death.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I didn't say fun fact. I'm not a monster.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> He's gonna be okay.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now it's a fun fact.</p>", "4565": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's nice to get back to nature. Why don't I do this more often? What a beautiful forest. Hello, little butterfly. What's your na -- Oh!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What'cha doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face.</p>", "4566": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why are you pretending to be outdoors? You hate it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Buddy, I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there.</p>", "4567": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, if that's true, why aren't there more genius squirrels?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Hands Penny the virtual reality headset) You may need this more than I do.</p>", "4568": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Come on, Raj, give me a bag.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, no, you're pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow.</p>", "4569": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey. Amy's downstairs.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, one sec.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, what, what you got goin' on here?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I bought a baseball cap.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I can see that. What team did you get?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, Hufflepuff, from Harry Potter.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, we'll be in the woods.</p>", "4570": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What the hell are you watching?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Raj found all these childbirth videos online. This one is of a woman giving birth in a river.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, that is the least Jewish thing I've ever seen in my life.</p>", "4571": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, now's the time.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Have you ever been off the grid before?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Once. The battery ran out on my phone. I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I was afraid he was gonna eat me.</p>", "4572": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, let's light a fire.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Ooh, that sounds cozy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't think I've lit a real fire before.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah, it's basic thermodynamics. I'm sure we can figure that out.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Right. So all we need is to...<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Got it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> A scientist made that.</p>", "4573": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, well now, we'll never win. You always play the drinking game.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Not the drinking game, a drinking game.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> To be fair, good at both.</p>", "4574": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, I'll go. Never have I ever been arrested.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So I drink.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, it's only if you've done it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Got it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I can't believe you've been arrested.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't believe Penny hasn't.</p>", "4575": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Can we really help?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> While we finish soldering these boards, it'd be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'll show you how to do one.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, wouldn't it be funny if after all your years of hard work, I'm the one who makes a scientific breakthrough? (To Bernadette) He doesn't think that's funny.</br></p>", "4576": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny says they're having fun working on the prototype.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know. I'm lowering the bar so slowly. This time next year she'll have a coin collection.</p>", "4577": "<p><strong>Cinema Worker:</strong> Excuse me. You guys interested in a free screening of an upcoming movie?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh. Sorry, we can't.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, hang on. What movie is it?<br/><strong>Cinema Worker:</strong> Oh, I can't tell you. But it does star Will Smith.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wait. I bet it's Suicide Squad. Let's check it out.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What about the girls?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Penny just said they're having fun. Honestly, you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, we'll take 'em. But, I swear, if it's Will Smith in Shark Tale 2, it better be at least as good as the original.</p>", "4578": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I mean, it's crazy, isn't it? I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress, and now I'm sitting in an engineering lab at Caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It is crazy. It's also crazy that I've made fourteen of these and you've made three.</p>", "4579": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Since when do you work on weekends?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm an astrophysicist. The stars don't take a day off.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You were home alone and had no one to play with?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn't like me.</p>", "4580": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay. Would you ladies please leave the room for a moment?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I need to rub my genitals on their prototype.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What's going on?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Leonard and Howard dont have a flat. They went to the movies. Look.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Un-freakin' believable.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Son of a bitch!</p>", "4581": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> It's okay, Sheldon. You know, I've saved a lot of weird things, too.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Like what?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, um, did you know I have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain I ever dissected?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have an old teddy bear I secretly wiped my nose on for years.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's not a contest.</p>", "4582": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, here they come.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Go hide.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, man, when I come out of the closet, I'm gonna nail those guys! Yeah, I heard it. Shut up.</p>", "4583": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> (Inside the closet) Don't forgive them. Stay mad at them.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What is he doing in there?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Busting you.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's okay. They apologized.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, it's fine.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well this is kind of anti-climactic.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know what wasn't anti-climactic? The end of the movie. Get this.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No spoilers. No spoilers.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And he's back in the closet.</p>", "4584": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know that you worked hard to put this together. I'm sorry I'm ruining it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, pl- you're not ruining it. Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now, that will ruin it.</p>", "4585": "<p><strong>Adam West:</strong> Happy birthday, young man. And if any of you have enjoyed seeing me here today, I'm also available for Comic-Cons, bachelor parties, bar mitzvahs...</p>", "4586": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, uh, you know, he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's funny. Let's do that.</p>", "4587": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, what about music?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No music it is.</p>", "4588": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What kind of cake do you like?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, my favorite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if there's writing on it, make sure it's not all caps. I don't need my dessert yelling at me.</p>", "4589": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Morning.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Morning.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> \"We\"? What is this?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't know. Maybe it says something on the back.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> \"Continued on milk.\" If you're tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn't work for my mom, and it won't work for you.<br/>\n\"Are.\"<br/>\n\"We are ... see spoons for more.\"<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What could it be? \"We are Groot?\" \"We are the champions?\" \"We are family, I got all my sisters with me?\"<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Are you serious?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Are you sure?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Pretty positive. That's a joke, because the pregnancy test says-<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, my God. This is incredible.<br/>\nWe're gonna be parents.<br/>\nWe're gonna get to board planes first.<br/>\nWe're finally gonna get to see what's in that family bathroom at the mall.</p>", "4590": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Look at this. I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn't have to worry about money. He can have all the kids he wants.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.</br></p>", "4591": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Consider tonight's episode a Valentine's Day gift for you, our viewers.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's also my gift to you. That was clear, right? 'Cause you're not getting anything else.</p>", "4592": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Look, I know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself, especially when you just got out of a relationship.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Speaking of ending relationships, when British Honduras became Belize, they designed a new flag with a tree on it, and I would like to hang myself from that tree.</p>", "4593": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I have an idea. Maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting Rajesh. Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind, handsome, intelligent -<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Rich parents! Don't forget, rich parents!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> -spoiled astrophysicist who not only...</p>", "4594": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> If you're really worried, we'll take him to the vet and have him tested. Good.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thank you. Oh, okay, there is a test! All they have to do is ... cut off his head and check his brain.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, cut off his head? That's where his little nose is.</p>", "4595": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, the last time I got a hand written letter, it was from someone who told me I parked like a blind person.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That someone has a name.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, thank you.</p>", "4596": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth. Oh, but then she found her old ones. Oh, so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fun. Like your Comic-Con Spock ears and your around the house Spock ears.</p>", "4597": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> That's ridiculous! If you had a superpower, and spent your whole life being told to suppress it, when you finally decide to embrace that power, why hide in isolation?!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm sorry, and how much money did your version of Frozen make?!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm just saying, instead of \"Let it Go\", she should really sing \"Look At Me Hiding in a Freezer Like a Dove Bar\".<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> She built an ice castle, made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. You know what I saw you do today? Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife!</p>", "4598": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How was your trip?<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Wonderful. And the pilot did such a good job, I gave him a butterscotch.</p>", "4599": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the tissue thing. Do it, ask her.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Can I have a tissue?<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Of course. (Meemaw pulls a tissue out of her sleeve)<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Isn't that the best?! She's like Grandma Spider-Man.<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> He's been saying that since he was little. I still don't know what it means.</p>", "4600": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other. I'll get your room ready.<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Oh, now don't you go looking through my suitcase for presents.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If I did, would I find any?<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Maybe. But you also might find my brassieres and bloomers.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's a risk I'm willing to take!</p>", "4601": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What happened? Is Amy gone?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh oh.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I know. It was quite tense. So here's the million dollar question. Uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?</p>", "4602": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Anyway, so I'm sorry to waste your time. And, uh and good luck with your screenplay.<br/><strong>Claire:</strong> Hang on. We're both adults. We can still get together without it meaning anything.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe, I've been planning our wedding.<br/><strong>Claire:</strong> Look, it's just coffee. I'll ask you some questions about science, and if you propose, I promise to say no.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay. That hurts a little, but okay.</p>", "4603": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, rub Vicks on my chest.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own chest.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet, but draw the line with me.</p>", "4604": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> We should all take a trip or something.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, Penny and I have been talking about taking a weekend in Vegas. Maybe we should all go.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Bernie would love that.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ooh! Ooh! Maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That sounds really fun.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, that sounds fun. A party-bus party don't stop. Ooh! When I say \"party\" you say \"bus.\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No!</p>", "4605": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, the guys and I were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that could be fun. But just to be clear, you mean a party bus with booze and music, right, not, like, juice boxes and video games?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes. And Howard's birthday was a drop-off party. You didn't have to stay.</br></p>", "4606": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's fine, 'cause actually you're not invited.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, now well, that's hurtful.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, Sheldon, you don't even like it there.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can consider a place America's urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit.</p>", "4607": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hi, Sheldon. What's new?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Our friends are jerks, and I'm mad at all of them.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I said, \"What's new?\" but sure.</p>", "4608": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Before you do, please give me one more chance to apologize to Emily.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, God.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Emily, as I'm sure you know, I'm considered an odd fellow. But what you don't know is that, while I often say the wrong thing, in my heart I mean well. I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know? And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, Sheldon-<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Shh, let him finish.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, for all the times I've offended you and all the times that I'll offend you in the future, I'm sorry.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Thank you.</p>", "4609": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Bernie and I are getting the house ready for the remodel. We could always use an extra pair of hands.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That sounds awful. Raj?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, I've got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets. You're more than welcome to join me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's the one to beat, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, if anything, I'm trying to get my Sheld-off.</p>", "4610": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Fine, you want something to do? There's about six months of data on this hard drive.<br/>\nWhy don't you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yep, I'm on it. Hey, look at that! An Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella.</p>", "4611": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, look. The teddy bear Stuart won the night we took him to the fair.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, he was so excited.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah. You know, no matter how hard they tried, they could not guess his age.</p>", "4612": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you thinking of naming it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I haven't settled on anything yet.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> We haven't settled on anything yet.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, way to go, Cat Poster. You hang in there.</p>", "4613": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, if anything, he's turning me into his mother. Before I did pharmaceutical sales, I was an actress. You know, I was pretty good. You know, girl-next-door type, but hot. Doable.<br/><strong>Dr. Gallo:</strong> Hmm.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And not only am I Leonard's mother, but we have this man-child living with us named Sheldon.<br/><strong>Dr. Gallo:</strong> Oh, Leonard talked a lot about him. I wasn't sure if he was real.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, he's as real as the fine I get when I use too much toilet paper.</p>", "4614": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> And can I get out of this mumu now?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Those are the robes of the Jedi, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> And they don't wear underwear.</p>", "4615": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Fine, take Wil. See if he brings you clam chowder.</p>", "4616": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I was always afraid this day would come. This might be the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually test the limits of public nudity.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Public nudity?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Eh, that just means going barefoot.</p>", "4617": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, Howard, what about you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh I can't. I'm going to the soup kitchen, too.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You said that sounded like the worst thing ever.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> If you can't support me when I'm lying, why are we married?</p>", "4618": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish. My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Did you know they served shellfish and eel at the very first Thanksgiving?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And there goes my list.</p>", "4619": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What number were you putting in? You don't know my birthday, do you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes, I do.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, what is it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> May.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> May what?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm not gonna say your password out loud. That is not secure!</p>", "4620": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You don't know your own husband's birthday.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Well you don't know everything about me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Your birthday is December 2, you grew up on Perkins Street, the last four digits of your social are 7-6-2-1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero.</br></p>", "4621": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Aren't you worried you're making French toast on oatmeal day?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ah, well, what's this? A pot of oatmeal? Or, thanks to you, what I will now call \"gloatmeal\".<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I don't want credit for that.</p>", "4622": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All I'm looking for is an educated, intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. She should be kind, patient, and most important, unable to imagine life without me by 10:00 tonight.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Isn't that a little unreasonable?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, fine, she doesn't need her own point of view. Now, chop chop.</p>", "4623": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you have any heels higher than this? He's pretty tall.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Ooh, tall! Finally some details about this mystery man.</p>", "4624": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, this is actually an interesting social experiment.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm a little jealous of the people who get to do it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Me, too. And we've seen the prize.</p>", "4625": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Right here.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We just happen to have those in the car?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Kinda. Before I met Howie, I liked to keep close tabs on my boyfriends.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> By stalking them?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No. Stalkers are creepy. I'm just a harmless little girl with military-grade spy equipment.</p>", "4626": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can I see?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What, now you're interested? You didn't even want to come.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know, but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun.</p>", "4627": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It looks like they're having a nice time. I wish I could hear what they're saying.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, I should've brought my parabolic microphone.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Your what?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Nothing. Not important.</p>", "4628": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hmm. I'm doing okay, and I was very popular at 13.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> In school?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, no. At home. The servants would sing to me, laugh at my jokes. I wish I knew their names.</p>", "4629": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You tell me. You woke up in bed with one.</p>", "4630": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Look, I get that you grew up here and you're attached to things looking a certain way, but I want this to feel like my house, too.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, honey, of course it's your house. Why else would you be cleaning it all the time?</p>", "4631": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> All right. Let's start over. I'm redecorating. The furniture, the carpeting, the walls. I'm changing everything that depresses me when I look at it. Try not to be one of those things.</p>", "4632": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> I told you, this guy is gold!</p>", "4633": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Whatcha doing?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh! Making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me after my dad left, but before she died.</p>", "4634": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, Raj. Dad and I were just talking about taking down this wall.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You sure? It's a pretty great wall.<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> What's so great about it?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (To Howard) I'm sorry. I did what I could.</p>", "4635": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Seriously? You brought Raj over to take your side?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Your dad's on your side.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> He's not on my side. He's doing all the work for free.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That is so generous of you. I'd like to switch sides.</br></p>", "4636": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> This documentary is going to be awesome!</p>", "4637": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, I've got terrible news.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's going on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow. Your face is pleasingly symmetrical.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just tell me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, well, that kind of stinks.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> \"That kind of stinks?\" Why aren't you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here (Leonard's face) is more like a Picasso painting.</p>", "4638": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you don't ask too many questions.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Who is he?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Where does he work?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How does he get the helium?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How many questions are too many questions?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe he's not for you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Four questions. The answer's four.</p>", "4639": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> He's using some kind of dating app on his phone.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, which one? Maybe we can get Amy to try it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't know. Stuart, can you come in here? He tried to explain it to me.<br/>\nIt shows you pictures of people nearby, you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with Stuart.</p>", "4640": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> What's up?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Can you show us that dating app?<br/>\nSutart: Oh, yeah, sure. This thing has changed my life.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow. So how many girls have you met?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Two. I probably don't need to mention there's an entire number between that and zero.</p>", "4641": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, no no, uh, definitely not.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What was wrong with that guy?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, he's Indian. We've already got one of those.<br/>\nOoh, we should find a nice Latino. Really round us out.</p>", "4642": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, you can trust us. We're respected scientists.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, he is. I'm a wedding planner, who can't find love himself. It's ironic, but the point is, we can't trust you. You're a sketchy character in a parking garage.<br/><strong>Dealer:</strong> Yeah, well, from my perspective, that's how you two appear to me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I never thought of it like that. Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won't it?</p>", "4643": "<p><strong>Dealer:</strong> No money, no helium. Seems we're at a, uh, stalemate.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not technically. In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves.<br/>\nUh, you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us, you know.<br/>\nReally, you're only limited by your imagination.</p>", "4644": "<p><strong>Dealer:</strong> It's a shame about those scientists ripping you off. I expected a higher ethical standard from our friends in Sweden.</p>", "4645": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, does everyone remember the rules? If he's shirtless, one sip. Posing with a pet, two sips. Pet and shirtless, chug like it's your job.</p>", "4646": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look at all these activities the university has. Rock climbing club, archery, flag football.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Had me at flag, lost me at football.</p>", "4647": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Well, sorry to disappoint you, but fencing is a serious sport. If you're not willing to put in the effort, you might as well just leave now.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We're not afraid of physical activity.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, I already ran 18 miles today.</p>", "4648": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, this is weird.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Barry Kripke just asked me out.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, look at you. Two guys in one day!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows!</p>", "4649": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you for letting me come speak with you.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Of course.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained, I'm turning to you for female comfort and encouragement.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Aww, I'm honored.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I tried reaching out to my mother, but she was in Bible study. Leonard's mother is on a book tour. My Mee-Maw was taking a nap. And after a while Siri started repeating her answers.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So, I'm your seventh choice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I know, top ten. Pretty exciting.</p>", "4650": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, in addition to Amy leaving me, Leonard's moving in with Penny. It's difficult not to feel abandoned.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, why don't you look at this as an opportunity? You had other roommates before Leonard. Maybe this is a chance to find someone new.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perhaps I could find someone better than Leonard. Someone I can rub in his face.<br/>\nChris Pratt's all the rage right now. I wonder how he'd feel about taking the smaller bedroom.</br></p>", "4651": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Stuart. He's been living with us for a while now. I'm sure he'd love to get us out of his hair.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Nope, couldn't be happier.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, Sheldon's looking for a -<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Nope!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> He'll think about it.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> No I won't!</p>", "4652": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, now all that's left is for us to sign and date the document, and we will officially no longer be roommates.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What's the matter?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's harder than I thought.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let me help you. L-E-O-N-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That helped!</p>", "4653": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was going to ask you what is the best fruit, but then I realized what I want to ask you is, \"Why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm?\" But then I realized what I really want to ask you is, \"Can you just go?\"</p>", "4654": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, what are you thinking for dinner?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, it's Thai food night.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, honey, you don't live with Sheldon any more. You can have anything you want.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're right. But what? Mexican? Italian? German? Indian? Greek? Cuban? Chinese? Pizza? Barbecue? Korean? Korean barbecue?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> How about Thai food?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, thank God.</p>", "4655": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> But what do you think?<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> I think it's very cute.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Cute? It's not cute. Cute is children dressed as vegetables.</p>", "4656": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm telling you, dude, the song has no groove. You can't dance to it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Who cares? I thought the whole point of Footprints on the Moon was to write songs that make people think.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You can do both, like Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\". While you're dancing you're thinking, like, \"Darn it, whose baby is it?\"</p>", "4657": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hi, I'm calling about your marriage counselling services and I was curious what your rate is.<br/>\nReally?<br/>\nUhm, okay, is there any kind of discount for length of marriage? We're talking hours here.</p>", "4658": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Raj, you're probably wondering why Amy and I aren't showing any affection to one another.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Didn't even crack the top ten.</p>", "4659": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What's this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard told me what happened, so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's so sweet of you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know.</p>", "4660": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Anyway... <br/>\n*leans in to kiss Amy, but gets pushed away*<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What are you doing? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're right, you did kind of kill the mood.</p>", "4661": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, Sheldon, when you're kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.</p>", "4662": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So why haven't we picked a date? <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know why. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, of course I know why. But just for fun... why? <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Not in a rush, busy with work... <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Things are good right now. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really good.</p>", "4663": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howard Joel Wolowitz, you get back here. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> *quietly* Never should have told you my middle name.</p>", "4664": "<p><strong>Emily:</strong> Look, Raj, be honest with me. If you want to end things, just do it. Don't expect me to do it for you. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> End things? I'm trying to tell you that I love you.</p>", "4665": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, there's a Denny's in Vegas you can actually get married in. <br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Doesn't sound very romantic. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes.</br></p>", "4666": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> And you know what the best part is? We took our time. I mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years, then we got together, and then we got untogether, then we worked out all our problems, and now we know everything about each other, we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Right. No surprises. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And no regrets.</p>", "4667": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> It's so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, my mother's been there for every honor I've won since I beat out my twin sister for the Did It on the Potty trophy.</p>", "4668": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Morning. <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We talked about this. I don't mind you still living here, but we got to have some rules. And rule number one is pants. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey. *enters wearing boxer shorts*</p>", "4669": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Hey, who's in the mood for spaghetti and hot dogs?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, me too.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Coming up.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't really feel I deserve it.</p>", "4670": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How'd you get ready so fast?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I packed light. Once I got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why'd you need a belt?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's called an evening look.</p>", "4671": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I worked hard on that speech, too. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. You could tell it to me. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, thank you, but I'm okay. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you sure? I could pretend I'm a high school cheerleader who can't control herself around esteemed alumni. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Greetings, distinguished cheerleaders. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh!</p>", "4672": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Boy, oh, boy, that's a lot of pieces. You know what they all do, right?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes, of course. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What about this one? *holds up a mini logic circuit* <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, I... How familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not very. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.</p>", "4673": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You're gonna be on Skype. They're not gonna see your legs.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I'm gonna go put on some pants just in case. But, I have to say, this is very freeing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Add a belt and I'll take you some place nice.</p>", "4674": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perhaps you'd prefer this one. The itzy-bitzy spider is not an insect at all. Because it has eight legs and two body parts.</p>", "4675": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an arch-duchy and not just a regular duchy?</p>", "4676": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Look. I know you guys are upset, but we've talked about it and we think it would be beneficial for you to be part of the project.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well. Well. Well. Did you hear that Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with Nose of the Aardvark.</p>", "4677": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, I'd like to try a technique. When no one gets streamrolled. When you talk, instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was just said by building on it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Building on that, we should order dinner.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How is that building on what he just said?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Building on building on that, there's a new build your own pizza place on Colorado.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Building on that, I'd like to remind you I'm lactose-intolerant.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I saw the menu. They have Soya cheese.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ha! You didn't say building on. You're out.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not Simon Says.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You're missing the point, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're out and you're out. I win. Who wants pizza?</p>", "4678": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Clearly, good things happen when I'm in charge. Now, why don't you boys step aside, let me knock this project out.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, you're not in charge. Raj is in charge.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, who's really in charge? The person in charge or those who put him in charge.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> He's right. If you think about it, we're all in charge.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, the guy in charge is in ch-. Why is everyone so bad at these?</p>", "4679": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. You two are out. Congratulations, Leonard, you're on the team.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> My mommy raised a gentleman.</p>", "4680": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What makes them think they're always in charge of everything?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> They're alpha males.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What does that make us?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We could be betas. They're second in charge.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, that sounds good.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Or we could be omegas. They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, that sounds like us.</br></p>", "4681": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> *using Sheldon's knock* Sheldon? Sheldon? Sheldon? *Sheldon answers with a suspicious and smiling look on his face*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one, you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I kind of wanna do it again.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't recommend it. You'll be doing it the rest of your life.</p>", "4682": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I like pharmaceutical sales. It's going great, but I have an audition for a movie, and if I get it, it could screw everything up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.</p>", "4683": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, I've been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I like to laugh. But say it anyway.</p>", "4684": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What do you say to a graduate of the U.C. Berkeley Physics Department? I'll have fries with that. Because his education hasn't prepared him for a career in the sciences.</p>", "4685": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You still worried some Berkeley girl's gonna steal him away?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes. Who do you think gave him the danger whistle?</p>", "4686": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called \"I Can't Spy?\" It's all the nail-biting tension of I Spy but the added fun of sub-atomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If it's half as much fun as \"1 x 10 to the 4th bottles of beer on the wall\", I'm in.</p>", "4687": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Don't listen to him. All she's got is a serve. Now grab a fresh tampon and put her away.</p>", "4688": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko invented Spider-man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies, and he's far richer, and he's a household name. You know, where as if you say Ditko, that sounds like a company that makes Dits.</p>", "4689": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Shall we tell everyone not to come?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, I wanna do this.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay. I'll keep it together if you can.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm not making any promises.</p>", "4690": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> That's so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're making it difficult to love you right now.</p>", "4691": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Where's Sheldon?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Date night.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That can't be much fun for Amy. You know at work today he tried his first Redbull.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What happened?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while. And then threw up in my car.</p>", "4692": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I have an idea.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think I have the same one.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We've got to watch Back to the Future II.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'll make the pop corn.</p>", "4693": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You didn't lose anyone when you met Amy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The study refers to romantic partners. That's not the way I would categorize the two of us.</p>", "4694": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you've got a problem basing a relationship on a contract, I'd like to tell you about thirteen plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the U.S. constitution. And it may not be cool to say so, but I think that love affair's still pretty hot today.</p>", "4695": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> It would make me so happy if you said things like that.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We got an 8.2. Trust me, you're happy.</br></p>", "4696": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm saying, in the spirit of science, what is that little skank's problem?</p>", "4697": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me. Is it at all possible that you're knitting a pair of pants?</p>", "4698": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, it's okay with me if you're not perfect.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, can I have one more moment with Leonard?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy just hurt my feelings. I wanna break up with her.</p>", "4699": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> If you had told anyone that you were going away on a train, by yourself, across the country, do you know what they would have said?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That I couldn't do it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Exactly. Right after they said 'yeah!'</p>", "4700": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't think the service is going to send any more people.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, maybe it's time we just release Ma back into the sea.</p>", "4701": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Of course you would. You're a loving person. I'm what my people would call a putz.</p>", "4702": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thanks for coming with me.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thanks for inviting me when everyone else said no.</p>", "4703": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wow. You're dead, so I'm going to let that slide.</p>", "4704": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How did that get you into science?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, I went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did.</p>", "4705": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of their life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter.</p>", "4706": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on. Anything can happen. We could push him down the stairs!</p>", "4707": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Why does Emily like this stuff? Do you think there's something psychologically wrong with her?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What difference does it make?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What do you mean?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Come on, she could have a freezer full of ex-boyfriends' body parts and you'd still go out with her.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I do like that the ex-boyfriend's out of the picture.</p>", "4708": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I have to go. Penny ratted me out. FYI, she's getting you a watch for your birthday with money she took out of your wallet.</p>", "4709": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I've had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television.</p>", "4710": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Does it at least pay well?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Less than I made at the Cheesecake Factory.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What does your agent think?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> She's thinking of taking a job at the Cheesecake Factory.</br></p>", "4711": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> T-60 seconds.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, it all comes down it this.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I've got butterflies!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't get soft on me, Hofstadter. I will slap those glasses right off your face.</p>", "4712": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> That's a whole lot of weird before cofee.</p>", "4713": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Aw, I have to go to the bathroom so bad.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Every year, I told you wear a diaper.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I told you I get diaper rash!</p>", "4714": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So Star Trek and Star Wars characters can go on the same branch?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know, it's crazy. Welcome to the Thunderdome, people!</p>", "4715": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, when you got home today and complained about feeling sick from eating too many jelly beans, did I tell you how to fix it? No. I said \"Aww, that must hurt.\" and I rubbed your belly.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I thought of you (Bernadette), the whole time.</p>", "4716": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you. Ira, if I may, I'd like to aplogize for my behavior last week. Now, isn't there something you'd like to say to me?<br/><strong>Ira Flatow:</strong> No.</p>", "4717": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine, I'll go. But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined and it's on you.</p>", "4718": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> He has so little self respect and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection, she could literally sleep with his own father in his own bed and post the video to YouTube, and he'd still buy her flowers and ask her to be his bride.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> He's right. But in my defense, if we could survive that, we could survive anything.</p>", "4719": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look at me! *Pulls up his sweater to reveal a rash*<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh my god. Is that sweater made of bees?</p>", "4720": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Alright, I'm mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me, you might have ruined the whole franchise. Except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it.</p>", "4721": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm going to hit the head. That's what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.</p>", "4722": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You say you're from New Jersey, but how do I know?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Who would lie about being from New Jersey?</p>", "4723": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> I power a clock with a potato.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Shut up! You can do that? I mean ... wouldn't that solve the world's energy crisis?<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> No.</p>", "4724": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Uncle Howard, Cinnamon's here for her sleepover party.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know if you had a stroke, she'd eat you, right?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.</p>", "4725": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, the equation balances, but it's certainly not elegant.<br><strong>Kripke:</strong> Whatever. Did you get any last night?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Kripke:</strong> Gave it to her good, huh?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I gave it to her well.</br></p>", "4726": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Aren't you gonna to eat lunch?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Nah, I blew my food allowance on Pokemon cards.</p>", "4727": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Bug report: when a guy asks me to spend some time with him, maybe he plans something a little more interesting than hanging out at home and watching TV.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Even Doctor Who?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Even Doctor Who.</p>", "4728": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Don't talk to her (Siri) that way. She's a lady.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Well, that lady took high-res pictures of my junk last night for Craigslist. Later!</p>", "4729": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> She says, do you play an instrument?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, but when I was six years old, I tried to start a band called Frankie Goes To Bollywood. But I couldn't get any boys to join, so my parents asked the servants to be my backing dancers. Wait, when you sign servants, don't sign it like I'm bragging. Sign it in a way that I sound humble with just a hint of, that's right, I had servants.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Do you hear yourself?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes, but she doesn't. So get signing, hand monkey.</p>", "4730": "<p><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Leonard, you want to come in for a nightcap?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, gee, dad, he'd love to, but Leonard has to work in the morning.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe I could go in a little late.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, no, no, you can't. Your career is far too important.<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Behind every great man is a nagging woman who won't let him have any fun, am I right, Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't I know it.</p>", "4731": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Here's your cat and here's your $20.</p>", "4732": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, how'd you two guys meet?<br/>\nZack: My company designs the menus for the Cheesecake Factory.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Your company?<br/>\nZack: Well, it's my dad's, but me and my sister are VPs.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, menus?<br/>\nZack: I know it sounds easy but there's a lot of science that goes in designing them.</p>", "4733": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> It's not enough you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the decorating committee, too?</p>", "4734": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, Raj has played his Phantom Warlord card and I am going to back him up with my strangling vines. (Playing card, making gesture to Leonard) Choke on that, sucker.</p>", "4735": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> \"Photographic\" is a misnomer. I have an eidetic memory, as I've told you many times. Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of May 7th. You had turkey and complained it was dry.</p>", "4736": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Pardon me, Sheldon, but how many reels until the protagonist gets to his point?</p>", "4737": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates re-uptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-amino  butyric acid.</p>", "4738": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Yeah, but research in to dark energy proved that Einstein's cosmological constant was right all along. So you're still, surprise surprise, a loser.</p>", "4739": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> See, the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet, and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson, but that future no longer exists due to Dyson's death in Terminator 2.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, then riddle me this. Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Skynet is kinky? I don't know.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes.</br></p>", "4740": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you have a cousin Leopold?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I made him up. I think you'd call him Lee.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't get it. I already told her a lie. Why replace it with a different lie?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> un-unravelable?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, if she Googles \"Leopold Houston\" she'll find a Facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use, and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-Harmony.com.</br></p>", "4741": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, let it go.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back. <br/></p>", "4742": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't come into your house and touch your board.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> There are no incorrect equations on my board.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that is so... so...<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> I'm sorry, I've got to run. If you come up with an adjective, text me.</p>", "4743": "<p><strong>Wolowitz</strong>: Check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my head and cough.</p>", "4744": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (In Mandarin) Many oxen are in my bed! Many, many oxen!<br/>\n*Chen flings his hands at Sheldon*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Mandarin) Oy Vey.</p>", "4745": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How'd it go last night?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Y'know, same old same old. Looked through a telescope, saw some stars. Big whoop.</br></p>", "4746": "<p><strong>Wolowitz</strong>: So, how'd it go with Leslie?<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn't move. I mean any more than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway.</br></p>", "4747": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Since we all agree Episode 1 isn't our favorite, why not just skip it this time?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard, I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favorite we should just get rid of it.</p>", "4748": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Since you two are going to be around for Valentine's, would you mind watching Cinnamon?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You have Valentine's plans!? Which came out sounding way more surprised than I meant. Here, let me try that again. You have V..!? See, I can't do it.</p>", "4749": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Don't be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. Came that way when I bought it.</p>", "4750": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In what world is a 4-4-6-4 a 4-10-4?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> A world I don't want to live in. (To Bernadette) Seriously, I no longer I want to live in this world. </p>", "4751": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yolk of the white man.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you honestly comparing  Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz's mom's with one of the greatest tradgedies in the history of man kind?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.</p>", "4752": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hi, dad.<br/><strong>Mike:</strong> Hi, honey.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, you brought beer for everybody.<br/><strong>Mike:</strong> Uh, yeah, okay. It's for everybody.</p>", "4753": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I would throw a quick slant to a wide out, given that the defense is showing blitz.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, I love a good blitz especially with sour cream.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Get it? Because it sounds like blintz.<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz</strong> Did someone say blintz?</p>", "4754": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> FYI, I had a donut for breakfast, you jerk.</p>", "4755": "<p><strong>Dimitri:</strong> What are you gonna do when you get back to Earth?\n<br><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Oh, I'm never going back.</br></p>", "4756": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where's my Bat Signal?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You have a Bat Signal?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I did. It was right here. She must have- Oh, my God, we're living together.</p>", "4757": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, look, I found an iPod.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's smashed beyond repair. What are you gonna do with it?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What else? Sell it on eBay as slightly used.</p>", "4758": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I know, I am resplendent like the noonday sun, am I not?</p>", "4759": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> (Talking about Raj to Penny) Don't you have a drink that could make him less obnoxious?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Drinks do not do that.</br></p>", "4760": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm who could it have been?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, what did you do?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I plotted my revenge. If you get a dish, I'll serve you some cold.</br></br></p>", "4761": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, so what are we celebrating?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, you know, Bernadette and Howard are pregnant again, and Amy and Sheldon are getting married. I didn't want you to feel left out.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Left out? Well, Bernadette has to grow a baby inside of her, and Amy has to marry one. My life is great.</br></p>", "4762": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You could put it in a satellite or a rocket, and it'll run forever.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Cool. Could it be used for missiles and war stuff?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, but we didn't create it for weapons.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Is it better than the one they use now?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> A lot.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Way better.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Huh. You sure you guys are smart?</p>", "4763": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, I don't think everyone-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, then, uh, Sheldon, we've known each other a long time. And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Little generic. Keep thinking. We'll circle back.</p>", "4764": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you. That was wonderful.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, wait, wait, wait. Stuart didn't get to speak.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, oh, okay. Um. Uh, Sheldon, I've spent most of my life feeling invisible, but having you and everyone-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, everybody, listen up.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (To Stuart) You nailed it.</p>", "4765": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car.</p>", "4766": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Have to say, you you do look good in that suit.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, thank you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Maybe later I'll, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But this is my birthday suit. Are you having a stroke? Because that's the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.</p>", "4767": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I got a letter from my Meemaw. Smell this.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What is that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, roses, Bengay, and Dr. Scholls' foot powder.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, \"Grandma\", by Calvin Klein.</p>", "4768": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> When did you get an engagement ring?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My mother gave it to me, and I had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up.<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Well, thank goodness for that.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I don't think I could do that.</p>", "4769": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I wouldn't.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just get in here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Go ahead.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Meemaw, look, I'm sorry, but I have to defend my girlfriend to you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, Sheldon, thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, great, now you're gonna get emotional. (hands Amy a tissue from Meemaw's sleeve)</p>", "4770": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, what if you make an appointment as a patient? Then you'll get to talk to her.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, they already know I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's interesting.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist. What would I say is wrong with me?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Low self-esteem.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Social anxiety.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sexual insecurity.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> None of that is true.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, denial. See, sweetie, the list goes on and on.</br></p>", "4771": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> A medium-sized asteroid.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's it? How common. That's the chicken fingers on the menu of space.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I kind of like chicken fingers.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor.</p>", "4772": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Boy, when was the last time Stuart cleaned this place?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No kidding. Oh, okay, I'm about to suck something up. What do you think this object sounds like?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie, I don't want to play Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore.</p>", "4773": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> (watching Howard and Bernadette sleep) I really miss this.</p>", "4774": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon I can tell you want to go, so if you'd be comfortable with it, maybe we could go as friends.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You don't think that will be awkward?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well it is Thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria, so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say yes. But if you mean between us I think it'll be fine.</p>", "4775": "<p><strong>Emily:</strong> Are you and I close enough for me to say that's creepy?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We are, and I believe the word you're looking for is eugh!</p>", "4776": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I feel cool. Like Puss in Boots.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Technically, swashbuckler is a combination of two terms. Swash referring to the sound of the sword. Swash. And then buckler, meaning a small shield, which you don't have.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> We can still be swashers.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hmm, well said, Puss.</p>", "4777": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, when my honor is insulted, and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> When was your honor insulted?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My last physical.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Again, that doctor didn't insult your honor. Just checked your prostate.</p>", "4778": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where is everything?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In my present, it's in the future. In your present, it's been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man I met in The Home Depot parking lot.</p>", "4779": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What about what you said in the restaurant?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, it's not forever. It's just for a while. If you want, we can think of him like he's our dog.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You can. I'm happy when you come home. And I'm scared of fireworks.<br/>\nAnd by the way, on July 4th, we're all sleeping here.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fine.</p>", "4780": "<p>*Stuart's phone rings*<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You need to take that? <br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> It's just my dad, probably calling to wish me a happy birthday. I'll call him back. You were saying?</p>", "4781": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Being your girlfriend is so challenging. Emotionally, physically. I've been incredibly patient for years. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Strongly disagree. Go on.</p>", "4782": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> So did I.</p>", "4783": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> \"It was just past dawn on the prairie and, like every morning, Amelia prepared to do her chores. Except something about this morning felt different.\"<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why? Why did it feel different?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> \"Maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air. Or maybe it was the unconscious, handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field. A man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings.\"</p>", "4784": "<p><strong>Dr. Lorvis:</strong> I'm not a delivery man. I'm a doctor. Although I do often deliver alarming medical results to my patients.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's humorous.<br/><strong>Dr. Lorvis:</strong> All right.</p>", "4785": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I bet you leave your patients in stitches. *Silence* That was also humorous.<br><strong>Dr. Lorvis:</strong> All right.</br></p>", "4786": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon, you busy?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm always busy. This mind is capable of advanced multi-tasking. Currently, I'm attempting to solve the Penrose Conjecture, I'm composing my Nobel acceptance speech for when I've solved the Penrose Conjecture, and I'm wondering how mermaids have babies.</p>", "4787": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We'll take some funions.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Anything else?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Some York Peppermint Patties, a couple of Dr. Peppers, and run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player and Season 1 of a show called Hannah Montana.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Have her get Season 2. In Season 1 it was still finding itself.</p>", "4788": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> And you love the sound of your own voice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, of course I do. Listen to it. It's like an earful of melted caramel.</p>", "4789": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, hang tight. Hey, do you want me to bring you anything?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, please. A pair of pants, and my toothbrush, and my mail, and a really good come back for chicken legs. Because \"I know you are, but what am I?\" was met with stony silence.</p>", "4790": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How many women have you had dates with?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Eleven.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Eleven.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wait, do I count the 200lb Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic-Con?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.</p>", "4791": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I'm not going to the funeral.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All those people blowing their noses. You can't tell the sick from the sad.</p>", "4792": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What can we do that's fun?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What can we do that's different?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What can we do that's free?</p>", "4793": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Excuse me, fellas. Sorry for eavesdropping, but there actually was some big string theory news out of the Hadron Collider.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or super-symmetry?<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> No, but they did find evidence you'll believe anything</p>", "4794": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I get it. I know what it's like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You mean your acting career?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Your relationship with Leonard?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Your failed attempt to go back to college?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No!</p>", "4795": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't know what to say.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't say anything. ... I mean you could say thank you, I did just buy you a car.</p>", "4796": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My spot on the couch has a great view of a window. Sometimes I can see space battles through it. It's called a TV.</p>", "4797": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I think I have you both beat. Imagine trying to be a grown up when you've never even been with a man.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sex is not what makes you a grown up.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, or you'd be the oldest one here.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? Is that how you talk to your mother?</p>", "4798": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> (On the phone) No, Dad. I don't think they cut me out of the show because I was too pretty. No, I don't need you to come out and kick Mark Harmon's ass.</p>", "4799": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Doing laundry?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course I'm doing laundry. Saturday night is laundry night and I'm in a laundry room, so I believe your inference is justified.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, \"My inference is justified\", Sheldon you are so funny!</p>", "4800": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Gentlemen, please. Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes. He can't walk in my actual shoes, he has the feet of a toddler.</p>", "4801": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If it makes you feel any better, Amy and I are fine. I mean really good.</p>", "4802": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> What did you put for your best feature?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> My parents' money. What did you put for your best feature?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I put \"not applicable\".</br></p>", "4803": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag, but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet.</p>", "4804": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm unlovable.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's just the booze talking.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I haven't had a drink since last night.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're talking to me!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I am! Now I'm crying for a whole different reason.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Me too.</p>", "4805": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, my goodness. Aren't you the cutest little Yorkie ever! You got him for me?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Her. We thought you two would hit it off.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I think we already have.<br/></p>", "4806": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Did you tell her her about your favorite asthma inhaler?</p>", "4807": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> How long was it?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> 94 seconds.</br></p>", "4808": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You guys ready?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up.</p>", "4809": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> It's a small, brown paper bag, ma, I'm looking at it right now. Why would I make that up? There's no Ding Dong in it. How are two Ding Dongs tomorrow gonna help me today?</p>", "4810": "<p><strong>Wolowitz</strong>: He doesn't do anything for me. If I were going to go that way, I'm more of a Zac Efron kind of guy.<br><strong>Raj</strong>: Oh yeah, like you have a shot with Zac Efron.</br></p>", "4811": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Knocking) Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Let it go, Sheldon. The murderer was the first mate whether it made sense to you or not.</p>", "4812": "<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: You could be Batman? <br> <strong>Sheldon</strong>: Yeah.  I'm Batman. See?</br></p>", "4813": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality. Let alone showing them in various stages of undress.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson in a wet t-shirt bent over the hood of a Porsche.</br></p>", "4814": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's not that hard. You just look to where you want to throw it, step towards where you want to throw, and throw it.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> That's your help? That's like saying \"Here's how you fly a plane: get in the airplane and know where you want to go, and fly it.\"</br></p>", "4815": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So when you guys plan on getting married?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> We're not sure, but I wanna wait long enough to prove to my mother I'm not pregnant.</br></p>", "4816": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You suck, Wolowitz!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He makes a valid point!</p>", "4817": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Like our lawyers say, the world is full of things that can cause a rectum to bleed.</p>", "4818": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So you never went outside?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Or had a single piece of fruit.</p>", "4819": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perhaps I'll spend some time devising a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anybody at any time. Unless they're German, because that's a tough crowd. </p>", "4820": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> That is one tough birdie.</p>", "4821": "<p>*Knock, Knock*<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Who is it?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Amy Farrah Fowler.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Darn, she found me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She's been here before. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. Now get my back, Jack.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you want me to do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Tell her I'm not here.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where are you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know. You'll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details.<br/>\n*Later, Leonard answers the door to Amy*<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hi, Amy. Sheldon's not here.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> All right.<br/><strong>Sheldon (to Leonard):</strong> Way to go on the details.</p>", "4822": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> It's just this is only our first date.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, why don't we just figure out where we're going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time, solve for 'r'.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Or we could just wing it.</p>", "4823": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Ooh, there's a cover band in the lounge.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Eh, no.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> But they play Barry Manilow.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> But they're called Fairly Manilow.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, okay.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Great!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No!</br></br></p>", "4824": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You're a grown man. You should be able to pick whichever Hobbit you want. ... I wish you wouldn't, but one problem at a time.</p>", "4825": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Where are we going with this Dr. Cooper?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh please, I'm your boyfriend. Call me Sheldon.</p>", "4826": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know we could throw a dinner party too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sure. Just when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not like capes and tights and crap<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes. Although...<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.</p>", "4827": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Whoa, Drinky Smurf.</p>", "4828": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> I'm Barry Kripke and I'm here because you told me there was going to be a raffle. When is the raffle?</p>", "4829": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh Balls!</p>", "4830": "<p><strong>Rajesh</strong>: Why don't we do it your way then? We'll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.\n<br><strong>Leonard</strong>: Okay, that was uncalled for.\n<br/><strong>Rajesh</strong>: You started it, dude.\n</br></p>", "4831": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know, Sheldon, those topical conferences on Bowes-Einstein condensates parties are legendary.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Forget the parties.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Forget the parties!? What a nerd!</p>", "4832": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both think it is solid, we roll it out to the public.<br/></p>", "4833": "<p>Amy (to Penny): You do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai?</p>", "4834": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, I have just one question for you. While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didn't wanna go out with me because I was too smart for you. Well, news flash, lady: David Underhill is 10 times smarter than me. You'd have to drive a railroad spike into his head for me to beat him at checkers. Next to him, I'm one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes. So my question is what's up with that?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (tearfully) Why are you yelling at me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Never mind, we're cool.</p>", "4835": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Tilt up the camera, I'm looking at his crotch.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sorry, Papa!<br><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Oh, there's much better. Hi.\n</br></p>", "4836": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How wonderful, dinner with some assembly required.</p>", "4837": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> This is not over!</p>", "4838": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Die, Wil Wheaton, die!</p>", "4839": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> New pants?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, Stephanie got them for me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Nice. Cotton?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Actually, I think it's more of a wool-fire ant blend.</p>", "4840": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm a lamb!</p>", "4841": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, this is amazing. I wish I had a playhouse like this when I was a kid.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? You never had a playhouse?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> No. I mean, my dad did buy the house next door for us to play in.</br></br></p>", "4842": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm gonna hook up the garden hose, so it has running water.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Why does it need running water?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Same reason it's got electricity: Bernadette and I both work, and we're overcompensating.</br></br></p>", "4843": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, uh, can you pass me that drill?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, fun fact about Amish barn raising, they don't use any power tools.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Amy, make him stop.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> No. If he tires himself out now, he'll sleep better tonight.</br></br></br></p>", "4844": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> President Siebert, you wanted to see me?<br/><strong>President Siebert:</strong> Hey. There's my guy!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You sound like my wife just before she asked me to go to Coachella.<br/><strong>President Siebert:</strong> No, this is gonna be way more fun than Coachella.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> More fun than heatstroke? Good luck.</p>", "4845": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, so, after I decide, do I then submit it to you for approval, or?<br><strong>President Siebert:</strong> No. You decide, you approve, and then you pride yourself on a job well done.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's a lot of responsibility.<br/><strong>President Siebert:</strong> Well, if I didn't think you were up to the task, you wouldn't have been fifth on my list.</br></p>", "4846": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, Siebert put me in charge of handing out the last bit of the administrative funds, and I have sole discretion.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ooh! Looks like Christmas came early. First thing on my list is a golden umbrella, 'cause Leonard's gonna make it rain!</p>", "4847": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, hold on, I'm not just gonna hand out money. There's a procedure you need to follow.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe he's referring to the traditional \"kissing of the buttocks.\"<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Should we form a line, or just do it like we're bobbing for apples?</p>", "4848": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Hofstadter! Heard Siebert put you in charge of the administrative fund. Can't think of a better guy for the job.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think he's done this before.</p>", "4849": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Leonard, I know you and I have a oh, troubled history, but I hope that when I make my request you'll give me a fair shot.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Of course.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> See? That's why I like about this guy: integrity. Bring it in! I just put something in your pocket. It's good at all El Pollo Locos.</p>", "4850": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I'm not going to reconsider. Your request was denied. I don't care if it helps you think; you don't need a koi pond in your office. Well, you should have thought about that before you bought the koi!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow. That was a little rough.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I have to be. Everyone assumes I'm just gonna give them whatever they want.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hmm. But you're not, are you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I'm not. I mean, look at this. An espresso machine? I don't think so. Denied!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, I really like this side of you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, just so decisive.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, check this out. A standing desk. Denied!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If you want to stand, do it on your own time, 'cause I'm the boss.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, you are.</p>", "4851": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, I just wanted to congratulate you on how well you are managing this grant money.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you want?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nothing. I just came by to pay you a compliment.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Nice try. The answer's no.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> To what? I'm not asking you for anything. All I need for my job is right here.<br/>\nHmm? This is my office. Which makes for a great commute. Home, work, home. I'm still working, I'm just working from home.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, if it's that easy, then why does Leonard have to drive you to work every day?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because I like the frozen yogurt machine in the cafeteria. Ooh, I suppose I could use a frozen yogurt machine-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Denied!</p>", "4852": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's just that work's been crazy, and the minute I get home, I have two kids hanging on me, and sometimes I don't want babies pulling my hair and pinching my belly fat.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That'd be a good slogan for a condom company.</p>", "4853": "<p><strong>Doctor Lee:</strong> Oh, Dr. Hofstadter, did you have a chance to look over my proposal?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I did, and your research is fascinating. I had no idea that crows were that smart. Do they really hold grudges?<br/><strong>Doctor Lee:</strong> They do. One of them escaped from my behavioral study a year ago. I can't prove it's him, but something craps on my car every day.</p>", "4854": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Someone's making decisions.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm reviewing these proposals.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. 'Cause you're the boss man, telling people what's what. I like it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (whining) It's just so hard! All-all three of these proposals have merit. How do I choose?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, not with that voice.</p>", "4855": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Whatcha doin'?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You scared me.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'll ask again. What-cha doin'?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Nothing.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really? You and Bernadette aren't doing stuff without me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What? No! Why would you even say that?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You know how your talent is getting just drunk enough to have a good time without being hungover the next day?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, mine is knowing when I'm being excluded.</p>", "4856": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm just running some errands.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yeah? With a bag full of wine?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I got to stay hydrated.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Try again.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, look, I'm sorry. We did not mean to leave you out. All right? Bernadette has been feeling fried at home, so we ended up hanging out in Halley's playhouse.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Like a secret club?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No! Just, like, a place to spend time that we don't tell anyone else about.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And what would be a shorter way of saying that?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (quietly) Secret club.</p>", "4857": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm in a secret club! Shh! Is there some sort of humiliating initiation? 'Cause I would literally do anything.</p>", "4858": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sorry. I'm distracted.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ooh, aren't you the hustler.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No matter who I give the funds to, someone is gonna be upset with me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you really care if people are angry at you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Of course.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Interesting. Why don't you go to the store and get me some tapioca pudding or I'm gonna be angry at you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So it comes and goes?</p>", "4859": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait, you can make this decision. You don't care if you upset people. You can pick for me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I certainly could.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, great.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I won't. I think this is a learning opportunity for you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, come on.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry. Did I upset you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ask me how I feel about that.</p>", "4860": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So where does Leonard think you are?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I told him I was at yoga.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, you are stretching the truth.</br></p>", "4861": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, don't freak out, but I think there's someone in your playhouse.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. Yeah, that's just Bernadette. She's been hiding out in there all week.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really? Why?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. She's been a little overwhelmed at work. And, frankly, me and the kids are a lot. She just needs some downtime.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And you just pretend like you don't know?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sure. That's how marriage works. Three years ago, I told her I got life insurance, and I totally didn't. (laughs) Someday, she's gonna find out. I'm gonna say, \"Ha-ha! I know you've been hiding in the playhouse.\"<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why don't you just get the life insurance?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Whose side are you on?</p>", "4862": "<p>[in the playhouse:]<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Can you hear what they're saying?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Shh, I'm trying.<br/>\n(cork pops)<br/>\n[in the hot tub:]<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Huh. Sounds like Penny's in there, too.</p>", "4863": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Interesting. What about not wanting everybody to be mad at you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I realized that, no matter what decision I made, people were gonna be mad at me. And this way, I get a laser.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That is the most selfish thing you've ever done. I'm proud of you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And I don't care.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, you do.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, I do.</p>", "4864": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> The europium laser is so cool. It has a four-level f-f transition which provides for high power output, and its quantum efficiency is off the charts.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What are you going to use it for?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I have no idea.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, there's a crow on your roof.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I see it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is that one of Dr. Lee's crows?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It has a tag on its leg.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't make any sudden moves.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Smart. Let's stand perfectly still and-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> [running away] He's the one you want!</p>", "4865": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, did you guys know this year's the 40th anniversary of Halloween?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, nonsense. Halloween traditions of date back to the Celtic festival of Samhain. Although our current Halloween customs come from the evening before All Hallows' Day, All Hallows' Eve. Thus, Halloween.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I meant the movie Halloween.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Well, that's not interesting at all.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did you know the Michael Myers mask from the film was actually a Captain Kirk mask turned inside out?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, now it's interesting.</p>", "4866": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you guys all dressing up for work?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Of course. I mean, how often do you get to wear costumes to work? Says the man with a giant belt buckle and a dickey.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, this is not a costume. It's a choice. It's a style.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's a tragedy.</p>", "4867": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hello. [dressed like Sheldon, imitating him]<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I see you are dressed as Doc Brown from Back to the Future. May I assume that Amy is going as his wife, Clara Clayton, from Back to the Future Part III?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She is. Did you do something different to your hair?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Looking good.</p>", "4868": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Inspector Gadget. And I want to say Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> So close. Kooth Bader Ginsburg. The Notorious KBG.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's very clever.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> [striking a gavel] Sustained.</p>", "4869": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I can understand how that would make someone irritable.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Interesting fact: \"irritable\" comes from the Latin, \"susceptible to anger.\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just because I used a word doesn't mean I want its etymology.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Interesting fact: \"etymology\" comes from the Greek word-</p>", "4870": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, why aren't you in your costume?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I just didn't feel like it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You get that I'm wearing a corset because of you, not because I'm tired of breathing?</p>", "4871": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, do you remember what happened at that first Halloween party that you invited me to?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> When I threw up in the pumpkin?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> More memorable than that.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? That was pretty impressive.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We had our first kiss. On this very couch.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, no, our first kiss was at your birthday. Remember? I threw you a party, you didn't make it, and I felt bad for you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, no, it was on Halloween, and you felt bad for me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> If we're gonna go through every party where I felt bad for you, we're gonna be here awhile.</p>", "4872": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Maybe Howard could apologize?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're kidding, right? Sheldon didn't apologize when he said my baby looked like Winston Churchill.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> He loves Churchill. Your son should take that as a compliment.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> He said it about my daughter.</p>", "4873": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How many times has he made fun of Howard for being an engineer? Going to MIT? His magic?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon doesn't make fun of his magic.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, he should. It's stupid.</p>", "4874": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong>  (imitating Dick Van Dyke's cockney accent) Well, Gorblimey. You look like a thousand tuppence. Don't he, Mary Poppins?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Are you gonna talk like that all night?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Jiff willikers, I am.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Isn't he cute? He's gonna get a spoonful of sugar later.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And I'm gonna sweep Ms. Poppins' chimney.</p>", "4875": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> (imitating Bernadette) Happy Halloween.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who wants to see a magic trick? Oh, that's right. No one.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Ha! They're you.</br></p>", "4876": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What do you think you're doing?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I thought it was clear. I'm being unnecessarily hurtful but with a sweet voice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And I don't understand what's going on because I went to MIT.</p>", "4877": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, people came, they ate, they vowed to never speak to each other again. I think it was a successful party.</p>", "4878": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think Howard hurting my feelings has in some ways made me a better person.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hmm. Look at you, improving on perfection. How so?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As you were eating that Danish, I wanted to point out that the Danish isn't Danish at all. It was imported by Austrian bakers during a labor dispute in the 1800s. But I chose not to, because I didn't want to be the kind of fella who foists unwanted facts about European pastries on the unwilling.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Huh. That's actually interesting.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sorry. Now you'll never know.</p>", "4879": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't understand. If it's unreasonable, why should we do it?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, how about this? You know in Star Wars when R2 and Chewbacca were playing holochess?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really? Star Wars?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, let the man speak.</p>", "4880": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, Bernadette.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Wait, did you just walk into my house?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, Howard let me in.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Where is he?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, he got in his car and drove away.</p>", "4881": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, people used to call me egghead 'cause there were eggs on my head. 'Cause they threw them at me.</p>", "4882": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> One time my brothers made me breathe helium. I tried to call for help, but the only one who could hear me was the dog.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's also terrible. My goodness, you had to live in a house with a dog.</p>", "4883": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon, you sure you're ready for this? This movie's pretty scary.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Please. I'm an adult. I think I can handle it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's what you said about the butterfly pavilion at the zoo.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That was my fault. After I pet that goat, I felt like a gladiator.</p>", "4884": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, whatcha doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Improving our wedding photos.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, that's nice. Wait, I'm still in them, right?</p>", "4885": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course.And not only you. I've added some guests who couldn't be there.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Who's that next to my father?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The Wright brothers.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And why are they at our wedding?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Orville, because I admire him; Wilbur, because he was Orville's plus-one.</p>", "4886": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Guys, I need your help, okay? I'm trying to buy her engagement ring. What do you think of this? Do you think she'll like this one?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, it's hard to say, not knowing much about her. Does she have fingers?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes, she has ten fingers and ten toes. Probably. I'll get back to you after I see her in sandals.</p>", "4887": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm pumping!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's Penny.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, come in.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I thought you were pumping.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I thought you were my boss.</p>", "4888": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, if this woman's gonna be around, I think we should check her out a little. I looked online. She doesn't have an Instagram, which means she's either 80 or something's wrong with her.</p>", "4889": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I still can't believe Sheldon had a best friend we've never heard about.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ooh, somebody's jealous.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm not jealous.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Leonard, this is a safe space. It's okay to be vulnerable.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> All I'm saying is you know the timing of a fellow's bowel movements, you don't think there's a lot left to discover.</p>", "4890": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I wonder what Tam could have done.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Hmm. Well, if Sheldon doesn't want to talk about it, it's got to be pretty upsetting.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I have his brother George's number, he might know.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? You have George's number?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> So so jealous!</br></p>", "4891": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Wait, wait, wait. If Tam knows what he did, we can just ask him. He's gonna be on campus tomorrow showing his son around.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Won't that make Sheldon mad?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Everything makes Sheldon mad.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah. Look at his list. Jim Henson for, quote, \"putting a terrifying, giant yellow bird on television and in my nightmares.\"</p>", "4892": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, this is so nice.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mm-hmm.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Maybe instead of introducing ourselves to Anu, we could just get a room, order some food and take a nap.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I've fallen for that line before. It never leads to napping.</p>", "4893": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> She can get into any restaurant, but the best husband she can find is Raj?</p>", "4894": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Tam Nguyen?<br/><strong>Tam:</strong> Yes. Is my son done with his tour?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No idea. We're actually friends of Sheldon Cooper.<br/><strong>Tam:</strong> Oh, I've been trying to get in touch with him, but I never heard back. Is he okay?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, if you mean physically, yes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> If you mean every other way, no.</p>", "4895": "<p><strong>Tam:</strong> So, is he here?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, no. He didn't come. He's, uh, he's still pretty upset about ... you know.<br/><strong>Tam:</strong> I know what?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, you-you must know.<br/><strong>Tam:</strong> No, we haven't talked in, like, 20 years.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Right. Because ... you know.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't think he knows.<br/><strong>Tam:</strong> What are you guys talking about?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why did you and Sheldon stop being friends? What did you do?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And don't worry, even though we just met you, we think you're right and he's wrong.</p>", "4896": "<p><strong>Tam:</strong> Sheldon! So good to see you!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Tam.<br/><strong>Tam:</strong> It's been a long time.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mm, not long enough to erase the sting of betrayal.<br/><strong>Tam:</strong> How did I betray you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know what you did.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, let me catch you up. He does not.</p>", "4897": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, I was curious to find out what Tam had done wrong. Why am I not surprised the answer is nothing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So you're taking his side. You scurvy dog. You watch yourself.There  is room on my enemies list now that the cafeteria ladies finally told me what's in the chili. By the way, don't eat the chili. Wait, wait, wait. You know what? Do.</p>", "4898": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> This place is amazing. I can't believe you got us in here.<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> Well, it's kind of my job. Usually I get tipped for it, but I'll leave that up to you.</p>", "4899": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I dunno, I married for love and it turned out ... fine.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> [silence] Oh, yeah, me, too.</p>", "4900": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Let me guess. This thing with Tam escalated, and now you're mad at Leonard and looking for a new best friend?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know me so well. It's too bad you can't be my best friend.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I can be.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You can't be my wife and my best friend. Who would I complain about you to?</p>", "4901": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Just tell me what happened.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard talked to Tam behind my back and took his side. And after what he did to me. Can you believe it?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No. I'm-I'm shocked and outraged. Now, tell me why I'm shocked and outraged.</p>", "4902": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When I got accepted to grad school at Caltech, I was afraid to move so far away from home. So Tam said he'd move out here with me and be my roommate. Then, over the summer, he got a girlfriend, even after reading all the pamphlets I gave him about social diseases.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Aw, I remember when you gave me those pamphlets.</p>", "4903": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Anyway, Tam stayed with her in Texas, and I had to move out here all by myself.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That must've been scary.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It was. I was lonely, and I thought I'd never make a friend again. And for a long time, I didn't.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> But then you did. And great friends. If you think about it, if Tam had moved out here with you, who knows what your life would've been like.<br/>\n[Montage of classic <em>The Big Bang Theory</em> moments with Tam as Sheldon's roomate]</p>", "4904": "<p><strong>Anu:</strong> Come on.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> There's really nothing to tell. Raj is so much fun to hang out with. He's like one of our girlfriends. And I mean that in a good way.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> But also a bad way.</p>", "4905": "<p><strong>Anu:</strong> Anything else?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I mean, he takes baths with his dog, but not in a weird way.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Or a normal way; they both wear swimsuits.</br></p>", "4906": "<p><strong>Tam:</strong> Hello, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello Tam. Thank you for coming. I just want you to know that, um, I forgive you.<br/><strong>Tam:</strong> I didn't do anything.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And yet, here I am, still being the bigger man.</p>", "4907": "<p><strong>Tam:</strong> Look, I was in love with Beth, and she made me happy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? Did she let you play with her train set?<br/><strong>Tam:</strong> In a manner of speaking.</p>", "4908": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, you all remember Tam, my best friend from high school.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Of course.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How's it going?<br/><strong>Tam:</strong> Sheldon's been showing me and my son around. Now we know where all the clean bathrooms are.</p>", "4909": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You just remember the mnemonic: if it's number one, the library's fun, if it's number two, the basement's for you.</p>", "4910": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, don't worry, Leonard, you're still my California best friend.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Cool.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, what do you want to do now? Go to the train store, go to the comic book store?<br/><strong>Tam:</strong> Actually, I have to grab my son and head to the airport. I was just about to call a cab.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't be silly, you don't have to call a cab. You're my oldest friend. Leonard will take you. Right, Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure.</p>", "4911": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Shall we?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Eh, eh, eh, hold on. I haven't seen Tam in 20 years, give me a chance to say good-bye. Bye. [Sheldon walks away]</p>", "4912": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Check it out, LeBron James posted a picture of me and him on Instagram.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't see you.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Look right behind him.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay. You see that table just past his left shoulder? Now go back two more tables and over to the right.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All I see is a yellow smudge.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's me!</p>", "4913": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now, I'm not sure if this helps, but did you know that pineapples were once so rare that King Charles posed for a portrait with one?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How does that help?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, it helped me. I've been trying to slide that into a conversation for years.</p>", "4914": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's just Penny hit me with some pretty big news and it's a lot to process.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And you'd like to do that quietly. I respect that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She said she doesn't want to have kids.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Maybe she didn't mean it, like when you said you didn't want to talk about this.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Forget it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you want to have children?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I always assumed we would and now I find out, you know, I might be the last of the Hofstadter line.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Doesn't your brother have children? And your sister. She kept the Hofstadter name and has five healthy boys: Neil, Jeffrey, Scott, William and baby Richard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm going back to being quiet.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sweet.</p>", "4915": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What the hell, Penny?!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm gonna need more than that.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You're not having kids? How could you do this to me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> How is it any of your business?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Because your kids were supposed to be friends with my kids. Who's gonna be friends with them now?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> They will find other friends.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, sure, 'cause Sheldon's DNA plus my DNA equals a kid who knows how to make friends. Grow up!</p>", "4916": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> This is between me and Leonard.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Screw Leonard! We were supposed to get pregnant together. We were gonna be barf buddies. We were supposed to massage each other's perineums with vitamin E.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm about to be your barf buddy right now.</p>", "4917": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Listen, when you have kids, I'm still gonna be there. I'm gonna be their fun Aunt Penny who gives them candy, and teaches them swear words and tells them stories about what a weirdo their mother is.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I guess I could live with that. What is gonna be hard is letting go of the dream of us breastfeeding each other's babies.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And it's gonna be hard to forget you said that.</p>", "4918": "<p><strong>Anu:</strong> I guess if we're going forward with this wedding, we should talk about the next steps.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, like themes and flowers?<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> Actually, finances and taxes.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh. We can't use that. That was the theme of my parents' divorce.</p>", "4919": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Guys, so what do you think?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I don't know, we're pretty happy here.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. Plus, if we moved, we'd probably just get a loft downtown.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? I always figured we'd get a place with a yard.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, sure, yeah, that makes sense, so you could shoot hoops and mow the lawn?</p>", "4920": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I just don't think you can truly know someone until you've spent a lot of time with them.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Really? What's Penny's dream vacation?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, Malibu beach house.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's Barbie's dream vacation. Maybe you should send us that questionnaire.</br></p>", "4921": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Uh, what are you guys up to?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Reading.<br/><strong>Denise:</strong> Oh, nice, I wish I read more.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, if it's important, you find the time.</p>", "4922": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, with them in his room, doing stuff.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, come on, we're sitting right out here. They're not gonna do anything.<br/>\n[\"Smooth Operator\" starts playing loudly in Stuart's room]<br/>\nI'd like to change my answer.</p>", "4923": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, you really are good at this.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I've spent a lot of time painting D&amp;D miniatures. I know that makes you want to rip my shirt off, but wait until your nails are dry.</p>", "4924": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> He sent us that Indian marriage questionnaire.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, read one.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay. \"How religious are you?\" That's easy, both of us: not at all.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, I wouldn't say not at all. I mean, I am pretty spiritual. I do go to yoga, so...<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Great, so your church is Our Lady of the Stretchy Pants.</p>", "4925": "<p><strong>Anu:</strong> I never thought I'd let my family set me up, either, but I'm 34, I'd like to have kids and it's hard to date because I work so much.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, yes, uh, you're a concierge.<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> For now. I plan to be managing a hotel in the next five years. Four, if I can get the current manager out of the way. He's a smoker, so fingers crossed.</p>", "4926": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I get it. You know, um, I used to have a long list of what I wanted from a wife.<br/>\nUh, eyes like Sandra Bullock, hair like Sandra Bullock, and the bravery of Ryan Stone.<br/>\nThat's Sandra Bullock's character in Gravity. But now, I just want someone nice.</p>", "4927": "<p><strong>Anu:</strong> I think I'm nice. Are you nice?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, I'm definitely nice. Every time a girl breaks up with me she always starts with, \"You're a nice guy.\"</p>", "4928": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, want to get lunch?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I can't. Halley and Michael were up all night, and I'm way behind here.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, no, are they sick?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No. They were just laughing and playing like a couple of jerks. Boy, they're cute, but they ruin everything.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I get that. You know, I've been thinking lately that maybe I don't want kids.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Are you crazy? Of course you want them. It's amazing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You just said they ruin everything.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm allowed to. It's their fault I pee when I laugh.</p>", "4929": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hang on, why is it crazy to say I might not want kids?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, it's not crazy. It's just wrong. You only think you don't want kids, but once you have kids, you'll realize that you did want them.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Or I don't want them, so I won't have them, so back off.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Aw, you sound just like me before I became a mom and learned what the meaning of love was.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, I cannot believe how condescending you're being.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Look, I know it's scary, but you're gonna be a great mom.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know I'd be great, but the point is I don't want to be one.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Maybe you wouldn't be great. You kind of got a temper.</p>", "4930": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Wait, you're not seriously marrying a woman you've met once.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why not? She's nice, I'm nice. We're just as likely to be happy as any other two people. Maybe even happier. (to Leonard) Sorry, that was not a swipe at you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I didn't think it was.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, good, 'cause it was not.</p>", "4931": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Why can't you just be happy for me?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Because you're being dumb. You don't know anything about her.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, how come you all get to be married and I have to stay single?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I think that's a question for a licensed professional.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You know what, you're not just insulting me. Okay? You're insulting my family, my culture and my future bride, Anu, a vegetarian with a master's degree from Cornell whose favorite fruit is pineapple.</p>", "4932": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, we got everybody gifts.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aw.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did you forget about us until you were at the airport?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. We forgot about you until we were on the plane. Luckily, there was Wi-Fi, and I have Amazon Prime.</p>", "4933": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look, it doesn't have to just be New York. That's the beauty of it. Uh, the initials \"N.Y.\" can stand for anything you like. For instance, I understand that there is an elderly rock-and-roll musician named Neil Young. Perhaps you heart him. Or if not him, Egyptian table tennis silver medalist Noha Yossry. Or Nana Yamaguchi, the Japanese voice actress who starred in Sally the Witch.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Did you just Google the initials \"N.Y.\"?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I had Wi-Fi and a long plane flight. Draw your own conclusions.</p>", "4934": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, that's not how you write a thank you card.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's wrong with it?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> \"Dear Aunt Helen, thank you so much for the lovely place setting. If my handwriting looks strained, that is because this is the 16th thank you card Amy has forced me to write. The muscles in my wrist are cramping as I struggle to finish this sentence. Ow, ow, oh, the pain. Love, Sheldon.\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. \"And Amy.\" Ow.</p>", "4935": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> This one is from Leonard and Penny. Aw. \"The perfect gift for the perfect couple.\"<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Save that card. We may need to throw it back in their faces.</br></p>", "4936": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I wonder what it could be.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, could be anything. A flute, a letter opener, one of those pens where you put the bikini back on the naked lady.</p>", "4937": "<p><strong>Denise:</strong> Do you think when Krypto the Superdog is out flying, Superman has to fly after him with a little baggie?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hmm. Haven't really thought about it before. But he doesn't need a baggie, because he just blasts the poop with his heat vision.<br/><strong>Denise:</strong> You've thought about it before.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, I've thought about it a lot.</p>", "4938": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Seriously, do you think I should ask her out?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Absolutely. Don't let love get away. It is the most important thing in the world. Without it, life is dark and meaningless and all you're left with is the judgmental gaze of your dog as you finish off a bag of Doritos on the toilet.</p>", "4939": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong>  I can't stop thinking about that present. It's driving me crazy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Me, too! The card said it was the perfect gift. But it's not a dinosaur fossil or matching pocket watches, so I don't see how it can be.</p>", "4940": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We just need to think like them. (inhales, exhales) Okay. What gift can I get us to express how grateful we are to have us in their lives?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Way to make it simple.</p>", "4941": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What's wrong with his face?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> A lot of people have been asking that. He's smiling.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, Stuart, you look pretty happy.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, yeah. I, uh, asked Denise out on a date, and she said yes.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Aw. That's great. But don't smile like that in front of Halley. She just started sleeping through the night.</p>", "4942": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'm excited. I haven't been on a date in a long time.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Back when I was dating, I'd always wear a new pair of underwear, just in case.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> It's also been a long time since I bought new underwear. And I probably should, because these are no longer tighty nor whitey.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay, I'm out.</p>", "4943": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I just wanted to pop over and hand-deliver this thank you note for your very thoughtful wedding gift.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, good. You guys liked it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, we liked it a lot more than things that aren't it, I'll tell you that.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, yeah, that's great. Because when we saw it, we thought, \"Amy and Sheldon just have to have that.\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, do tell. Now, paint a picture for me, like where you were when you found it and what you thought we'd enjoy doing with it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you not know what it is?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Of course he knows what it is. He's the smartest man in the world.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I don't know about the world. Some of those Chinese fellas are pretty clever. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to return home and use your gift in the manner which it was intended.</p>", "4944": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, what is it? What did you give them?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, i-it's just this dumb crystal wand that Howard and Bernadette gave us for our wedding. Penny and I made each other miserable trying to figure out what it was, and we thought, \"Why not pass that fun along to Sheldon and Amy.\"<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wait a minute. Did-- did you give them the crystal chakra wand that I gave you for your wedding?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, that's exactly what we did.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You said you liked it!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, that's exactly what I said.</p>", "4945": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Wow. A scavenger hunt. That's exciting. I had a bit of a scavenger hunt myself last night. I was trying to find the remote. I looked under one of the cushions. Wasn't there.<br/>\nThen I lifted the cushion a little higher. Bingo.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Riveting.</p>", "4946": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, do you know what it is?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Of course I know what it is. It's a silicon dioxide crystal, otherwise known as quartz.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you sure?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Am I sure? Is basalt a mafic extrusive igneous rock formed by the rapid cooling of magnesium and iron-rich lava? Yeah, I'm sure.</p>", "4947": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, so it's quartz. That's got to mean something. What do we know about quartz?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll Google it.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Or you can ask me, the geologist who won the MacArthur Genius Grant.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Got it!</p>", "4948": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Quartz, from the German \"quarz\" which sounds the same, but is spelled without a \"T\".<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Interesting. No \"T\". What is not \"T\"?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Coffee!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> The coffee shop where we first met!<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> All right, let's go. Sorry. I think I just had an adrenaline rush from having visitors.</p>", "4949": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'm trying out some new colognes for my date with Denise.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, and you just came over here to rub it in my face that you have a date?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> No. I came over here because I need advice, and you've gone out with more women than anybody I know.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Huh. I guess you're right. Sheldon's the smart one, Howard's the funny one, and apparently, I'm the ladies' man.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Which one's Leonard?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, yeah, right. I guess Leonard's the forgettable one.</p>", "4950": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, let's have a whiff. Oh. (sniffs) Hmm. Smells like Paco Rabanne.<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> Ooh, you're good. I bought it at a swap meet. It's actually called \"Smells Like Paco Rabanne.\"</br></p>", "4951": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I met my wife here, and we sat at this very table, so if you play your cards right, in eight years, you could marry this woman.<br/><strong>Greg:</strong> That's my sister.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, don't tell people. That's not okay.</p>", "4952": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. Look what Halley drew.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, she made it at daycare.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's pretty good, huh?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Is it?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wow. Gentile moms are tough.</p>", "4953": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'm picking her up in an hour. What am I gonna do?!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't you mean what are you gonna \"Oompa Loompa doompety do\"?</p>", "4954": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Look, it's only a spray tan. It'll fade in a couple days. Why don't you cancel the date and reschedule?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, but I was really looking forward to tonight.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You know what? Then go. Tell her what happened. Maybe she'll be flattered.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And if not, swing by the chocolate factory and see if they're hiring. That wasn't a joke. That was a legitimate suggestion.</p>", "4955": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I know that, but I can't do this on my own. I need your help.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> (sighs) Well, then, I'm going to need your help, too. If I'm going to find a woman to set you up with, you're going to need to stop Instagramming pictures of you and your dog wearing matching sweaters.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Fine, if that's what it takes to show you that I'm serious. Uh, quick question. Do you mean just Instagram, or all my social?<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> All of them!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, deal.</p>", "4956": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I haven't met her yet, but her name is Anu. My father says she comes from a good family. She's in her 30s. She works in hospitality management. So, as long as I can get through six to ten dates without revealing my true self this is happening.</p>", "4957": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know just what we're giving them for a wedding gift.</p>", "4958": "<p><strong>Denise:</strong> Oh. Oh, my God.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Yeah. I wanted to look my best for our date, and I made a series of bad decisions one of which is hidden by my pants.</p>", "4959": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good morning, wife.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Good morning, husband. I can't believe we're actually married.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's official. According to tradition, we should hang the bedsheets outside so the villagers can see that we consummated.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't think that that's appropriate, considering where we're starting our honeymoon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I suppose you're right. Although, when you think about it, Lego is the perfect metaphor for marital congress. Two pieces that interlock with a satisfying snap.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, that's the sound you were making.</p>", "4960": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Now it's happening to me. Ooh, I should probably make a list of all the scientific inaccuracies in Mamma Mia 2.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're gonna go on live TV and admit you've seen that movie?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, your husband's the one who took me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Meryl Streep and Cher? Yeah, I saw it.</p>", "4961": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> That was weird, right?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Was it? I honestly can't tell anymore.</p>", "4962": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Really, Sheldon? You want to do it again?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't act surprised. It's clearly marked on the schedule. Now, shall we steam the wrinkles out of our wizard robes, or make vigorous, socially sanctioned love? Either way, I can check something off my to-do list.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> [reading Sheldon's to-do list on his phone] Socially sanc-- Oh, wow. Yeah, there it is right there.</p>", "4963": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, hurry. Raj is on next.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All right. I can't believe they canceled Vampire Diaries but they'll show this.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> This is the news.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And that was a woman torn between two hunky vampires. What is your point?</p>", "4964": "<p><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> Larry? I know you're in there!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Is that Amy's mom?<br/><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> Let me in. (shouting) Let me in!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Either that or the Big Bad Wolf.</p>", "4965": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, I'm a little jet-laggy. Maybe we can revisit this in the morning.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no can do. If we miss tonight, it's not scheduled until Thursday at 6:00. And that'll have to be \"no frills,\" 'cause we've got a 6:30 reservation at Benihana.</br></p>", "4966": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Really? Would it be so bad to mix it up a little?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mix it up? Who are you, Betty Crocker?</p>", "4967": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Poor Mr. Fowler, I really feel sorry for the little guy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know. After they had Amy, she should've just eaten him and been done with it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look at you retaining facts from a nature show.</p>", "4968": "<p><strong>Tour Guide:</strong> And here we have the former hotel where Tesla perfected the three-phase alternating current motor.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's wrong. I'm gonna say something.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Don't.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, then how will everyone know I'm the smartest boy here?</p>", "4969": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I brought you two hot dogs.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Aren't you gonna eat one?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> From a street cart? Are you crazy? I'm amazed that I'm holding them.</p>", "4970": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You realize that I'm not a particularly physical person.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I know.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When I was little, and people asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I'd always say, \"A brain in a jar.\"<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sure.</p>", "4971": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm just worried that if I don't schedule our bedroom endeavors, then I may not think about them, and you'll grow cold and distant and seek solace in the arms of a heavily-muscled longshoreman.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Where would I find a longshoreman?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Along the shore. It's in the name.</p>", "4972": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I could never be with anybody but you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's good to know. I wouldn't want to fight a man who's brave enough to touch a fish.</p>", "4973": "<p><strong>Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson:</strong> Well, that was fun. Let's see who else needs a deGrasse kickin'.<br/><strong>Bill Nye:</strong> Bill Nye the Science Guy.<br/><strong>Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson:</strong> Hey, Bill, Neil Tyson. We've got to talk.<br/>\n*Bill Nye quickly hangs up the phone*</p>", "4974": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> (to Georgie) I like your accent. Sheldon, did you used to sound like that? Can you still?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can. I will not.</p>", "4975": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's not right. That's so unreasonable. Yeah, well, if you're going to be like this, then I don't want to talk to you right now, either. Okay. I love you. Bye.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Amazon customer support?</p>", "4976": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, my mother. Guess who she's insisting we invite to our wedding.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Jesus?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If only.</p>", "4977": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My brother.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Wait a minute. You didn't invite your brother to your own wedding?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He tormented me my whole childhood. I don't think I should reward that type of behavior with a slice of wedding cake in the shape of the Millennium Falcon.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Try again.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A slice of wedding cake in the shape of a cake.</p>", "4978": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey. Step away from the bride.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (chuckles) Okay. I'll go back upstairs.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Get in the shower and then take those clothes and burn them.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, and all the rest of your clothes! Ah, worth a shot.</p>", "4979": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So am I gonna be, like, the only single guy at Sheldon's wedding?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. There-There'll be a lot of single people there. Stuart, Amy's great-aunt. Although, Stuart's already friended her on Facebook, so, better move quick.</p>", "4980": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We passed three of these stores on the way here. Why did you say he's just \"some loser who sells tires\"?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're right, that was unfair. He's a loser who sells more tires than anyone in Texas.</br></p>", "4981": "<p><strong>Georgie:</strong> What the hell are you doing here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, Georgie.<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> It's just George now.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine, George. No, I don't like it, Georgie.<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> I see you haven't changed one bit.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you, that is a nice thing to say.</p>", "4982": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You infected me a week before my wedding. What am I supposed to do about this? <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Wear a veil?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (laughs) ... It's not funny.</p>", "4983": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Look at what you've done to me!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ah, hey. Could you just, like, not touch my computer or like, anything else. I just, ugh, I don't want to look like that in your wedding photos.</p>", "4984": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Once, when I was eight, I was going to dress as my favorite scientist for Halloween, and Georgie threw my costume away. I had to wear a sheet and go as a ghost. Scared myself all night long.</p>", "4985": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, look, we don't fly out until the morning. Why don't I try and talk to him, give it one more shot?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right. But if he says, \"Nerd says what\", don't answer him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You are a lamb to the slaughter.</p>", "4986": "<p><strong>Georgie:</strong> If you are here about Sheldon's wedding, don't bother.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on. I-I know you two have your differences.<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> You mean pretty much everything about us?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, not everything. (laughs) You're both tall ... you have the same last name ... Maybe I shouldn't have started this like it was a list.</p>", "4987": "<p><strong>Georgie:</strong> Picking on him? Is that what he told you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, what about the time you threw away his Halloween costume?<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> Well, yeah, 'cause he was gonna dress as some girl scientist.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Madame Curie?<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> Oh, I didn't know she was a madam.</p>", "4988": "<p><strong>Georgie:</strong> Leonard, you know how I got the money to open up my first store? I busted my ass for it, 'cause all the extra money that we had had to go to Sheldon so he could go to college and he could go study in Germany. And do you know what he's never said to me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Danke schon? It's, uh, \"thank you\" in German.<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> Do you need me to sit on your head?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Nope.</p>", "4989": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, whatever kind of pink eye their kids have, I have, and I need to know. And if it's viral, I'm screwed.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe not. You know, I know it's not traditional wedding attire, but how about a welder's mask?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> If you know a welder, that could be your \"something borrowed\".</p>", "4990": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, you need to apologize to your brother.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes. Like that, but nicer, and that way.</p>", "4991": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is it me, or did we just patch a tire?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He said, \"Never patch.\" Do you even listen?</p>", "4992": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, is this Georgie?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. And what is he even using that stethoscope to listen to?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know, small leak?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, that makes sense.</p>", "4993": "<p><strong>Georgie:</strong> So you know what I'm talking about. And has he ever thanked you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not in so many words, or any words.</p>", "4994": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, he's invited me to his cabin for the weekend, to discuss a breakthrough he's had.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> His cabin?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. He lives off the grid, up in the mountains.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So you're gonna go to the middle of nowhere and spend the weekend with a crazy man you've never met?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. Why?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No reason. Have fun.</p>", "4995": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, what are you doing?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am decoding Dr. Wolcott's letter using this book as the key. Aren't conversations more fun when they're in code?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yes. But I'm using a code where \"yes\" means \"no.\"</br></p>", "4996": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't look at me. When the music stopped, you were holding Sheldon.</p>", "4997": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> That's great, everyone's got weekend plans. Amy has her bachelorette party, and Sheldon's gonna go to the woods and get hunted for sport.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, as someone who has to track him every time he gets lost in IKEA, I feel like I'd be really good at that.</p>", "4998": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you sure you're gonna be okay this weekend?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course. No, I'm much more concerned about you. I know how you gals behave when the men are away.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've read The Bacchae by Euripides. Drinking wine, riding panthers Proof that girls have gone wild for over 2,500 years.</p>", "4999": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm sure there'll be some drinking and some dancing, and then a mailman'll probably show up and take his clothes off-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nicholas is going to take his clothes off?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, not our mailman. A dancer pretending to be a mailman.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Impersonating a federal employee? Oh, where's the after-party, prison?</p>", "5000": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> As Sheldon's best man, I need to inform you that this is not a bachelor party.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And tell them why.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because you're a tiresome scold.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. It's because a bachelor party is typically a hedonistic blowout where no pleasures of the flesh are denied. I'm not interested in that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How is that not exactly what I said?</p>", "5001": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, listen. Dr. Wolcott is a brilliant topologist. We need to set some ground rules so that you don't embarrass me. [To Howard] No magic. [To Leonard] No whining. [To Raj] You, just no.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, how come he gets to whine?</p>", "5002": "<p><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> Well, um, I don't normally allow strangers into my house.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> But when you do, you-you let them out, right?</p>", "5003": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, Dr. Wolcott, in your letter, you said you had a new mathematical approach that would help me conceptualize the dimensions in string theory?<br/><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> Uh, yes, yes, yes, yes. But before we get started, I am going to need to collect everybody's phone. Yeah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> Because they're little listening devices, aren't they? Yes, for people to spy on you and steal your work.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, what happened to the good old days where if someone wanted to steal your work, they had to hire a prostitute to seduce you?<br/><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> Who told you about that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Just making a joke.<br/><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> Yeah, it's not funny when it happens.</p>", "5004": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What? This is my bachelorette party, tea and quilts?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, you said you didn't want anything crazy.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes, but I said it like, \"I don't want anything crazy.\" Which clearly means I wanted something crazy. I mean, is this how boring you think I am?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Penny, she asked you a question.</p>", "5005": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, we can make bad decisions.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. She had two kids back-to-back and I thought you'd like this, so we're off to a good start.</p>", "5006": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Dr. Wolcott, your work on time is revolutionary.<br/><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> I would say thank you, but, in my theory of time, you've already called my work revolutionary, I've already thanked you, and I hate repeating myself, so let's move on.</p>", "5007": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait a minute, are-are you saying that time has multiple dimensions, the same as space?<br/><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> No. No, I'm not saying it, the math is saying it. Though it is the math that I invented, so, yes, I guess I am saying it.</p>", "5008": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I could spend months up here just going through his math.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I think Sheldon might.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Great. Who's gonna tell Amy we lost her fiancee to a madman in the mountains? [Howard and Raj look at Leonard]<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, I drove.</p>", "5009": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> This is so exciting. Can we do a body shot? I've always wanted to do a body shot. Also, what's a body shot?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's when you take a drink out of a stranger's belly button.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Ew, no thanks. What if they have an outie? Does it just spill everywhere?</p>", "5010": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, how would this work in the context of a singularity?<br><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> Yes, that's-that's a tricky bit to explain. I assume you're familiar with non-abelian group theory.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, and how. You never forget your first group theory.</br></p>", "5011": "<p><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> It's a perfect marriage. We focus on our work and send each other cards every year on our birthdays. Hey, wait, what-what month is it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, April.<br/><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> Most years. The point is we give each other space. I give her Europe, she gives me South America. That's where she thinks I'm living.</p>", "5012": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you for bringing me up here. But I think I'm ready to go home now.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really? You don't want to stay for dinner and talk more science?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. No, we better go. I miss Amy. And my phone. [gunshot in distance] Also, I'm from Texas, and I can taste the difference between rabbit and squirrel.</p>", "5013": "<p><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> Dinner! Guys? I can't believe they left without saying good-bye. Wait a minute, what if they stole my work? Wait a minute! What if they were never here at all? Wait a minute! What if they haven't gotten here yet but they're on their way?! I better tidy up.</p>", "5014": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But maybe you could drop me at the bottom of the mountain. I want him to think I'm cool.</p>", "5015": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you have any mail for Dr. Sheldon Cooper?<br/><strong>Mailman:</strong> I do, but I can't hand it right to you. I have to put it in the box.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And that is what separates the U.S. Postal Service from those hippies at FedEx.</p>", "5016": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, looks like we need to figure out who the new president should be. I nominate myself.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I second it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Huh. Well, as a woman in love, I want to stand by my man. Too bad that's been rendered bureaucratically impossible.</p>", "5017": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, it's the American way, the peaceful transfer of power.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Think about Ant-Man.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm always thinking about Ant-Man.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Michael Douglas had the suit and then he passed it on to Paul Rudd.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Maybe you're right.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really? The Ant-Man thing? That's what won you over?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. He got the details right. That's how you use a superhero.</p>", "5018": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm sorry, Sheldon, but with minimal power comes minimal responsibility. And you couldn't handle it.</p>", "5019": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, I think you're forgetting that the sandwich was invented by John Montagu, the Earl of Sandwich.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. The truck's called \"Pearl of Sandwich.\" Now I get it.</p>", "5020": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, it's a distraction. How can I focus on my work when all I can think about is how much I want that sandwich?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So, go get one.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't just give in to every urge I have when I have it. That's why I have a rigid schedule. It's bad enough I had to give in to my urge to create a rigid schedule.</p>", "5021": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> No, apparently someone complained to the tenants association, and they're not allowed to park on our street anymore.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Who would complain about something that everyone loves? Oh.</p>", "5022": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did you complain to the tenants association about the food truck?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And they actually took you seriously?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, the tenants association takes every complaint seriously.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, great, because I'm about to send them an e-mail complaining about you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (phone chimes) Excuse me. Wow, someone should have spell-checked.</p>", "5023": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, oh! Let's play William Tell. I'll put this bowl on my head. See if you can knock it off without hitting me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You read my mind.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Either breaking a bowl or breaking Raj's head.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Be careful, they don't make that bowl anymore.</p>", "5024": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, so when I got a fine for leaving my clothes in the dryer for too long, that was from you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> $14.99. The exact price of a new gavel.</p>", "5025": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> And the noise complaint we got for singing you\"Happy Birthday\"?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As a friend, I was touched. As a representative of the building, I thought that you should pick a key and stick with it.</br></p>", "5026": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Why didn't you tell me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> 'Cause I wanted to make sure that you loved the man, not the office.</p>", "5027": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You can't just declare yourself president.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I didn't. I called a meeting, I was the only one to attend. I nominated myself, and after a pretty moving speech, I voted myself in.</p>", "5028": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not so fast. I believe we have one tenant here who has not made her voice heard.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We're waiting, fianc\u00e9e.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, we're waiting, best friend.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, we're waiting, neighbor who needed a battery and totally got one from me, no strings attached.</p>", "5029": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Ugh, I can't believe my best friend sided with Sheldon.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can't believe my best friend is Sheldon.</p>", "5030": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Don't be mad at me. I mean, I can't vote against him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Even when he's being crazy?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, what other times are there?!</p>", "5031": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> But this time-<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> It was me. Yeah. I was trying out a flirty new smile.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Now, I don't use the word \"ghoulish\" a lot, but I-I just can't think of another word.</p>", "5032": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hi. What are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard and Penny are trying to turn the tenants against me, so they are about to see just what kind of power the president of the tenants association wields.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> \"You must be at least this tall to use washing machine\"?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm gonna hang it up higher than Leonard. And then his clothes will smell. And nobody's voting for a man with smelly clothes. No, not when there's a perfectly unscented incumbent on the ballot.</p>", "5033": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, Sheldon. We found something pretty interesting.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Huh. Well, that is surprising. I, for one, have no idea what they're talking about.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong>  Turns out, when Amy took over Penny's apartment, she was put on the lease, not you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong>  Yeah, and when I moved across the hall, you got taken off the lease and I got added.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, what are you saying? That Sheldon's not technically a tenant at all and therefore, has no standing to be president of the tenants association no matter who votes for him? I don't know how you found that out, but I am guessing all on your own.</p>", "5034": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> If we don't do anything, how long do you think they'll talk about Batman?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I've know them for 11 years, so 11 years.</p>", "5035": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, I'm putting a stop to this.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> If you knew how, why'd you wait 11 years?</p>", "5036": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Actually, I've-I've already met him once before. He gave a talk at Princeton and my mom took me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, really? Was he nice?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He's super nice. I-I got pretty emotional and started crying and he didn't make fun of me or anything.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, you were a kid.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> ... Uh-huh.</p>", "5037": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong>  Wait, why are you being so weird?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It occurred to me that perhaps you were telling the truth about Bill Gates and it wasn't just part of an elaborate prank.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What would the prank part even be?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I show up to meet Bill Gates over your \"objections,\" but it's not Bill Gates at all, no. It's one of those look-alikes that you hire for a party. And then when I go around showing everybody the balloon animal that \"Bill Gates\" made for me, I'll look like an idiot.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Have you been eating laundry detergent?</p>", "5038": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Do you think you could get Bill Gates to sign something for me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, maybe, like what?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, my arm, my chest, his call.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> His call will be to the police.</p>", "5039": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What would you do if you had a billion dollars?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Same as Bill Gates, try to make the world a better place, but I'd do it in a working Iron Man suit.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I didn't know that came in a boys' medium.</p>", "5040": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sorry I talked about my kids the whole time.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, besides you cutting up my meat for me, it was a lovely lunch.</br></p>", "5041": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, these are positive changes. Studies with rats show that new mothers are more sensitive to danger, better at multitasking and bolder in the pursuit of food.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I did stick a couple lamp chops in my purse.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So that's what I was smelling.</p>", "5042": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Look, even though your brain is different, in many ways, it's better.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> But were you bored?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Of course not.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're lying.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Which you can tell, because your maternal brain is better at sensing nonverbal cues.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Now you're just being condescending.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Look at you, two for two.</p>", "5043": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, where you been?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, just hanging out with the guys.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> They still mad at me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, they were, but then I was like, \"Hey,\" and they were like, \"What?\" and I was like, \"You know,\" and they were like, \"Okay.\"<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're a good husband.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, it's not for me to say, but you just said it, so you're probably right.</p>", "5044": "<p><strong>Bill Gates :</strong> Wait, I know you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, you don't.<br/><strong>Bill Gates :</strong> Yes, I do. You were waiting for me at my hotel. You ruined my tie.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, what? What's he talking about?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, he, uh-- obviously, he's kidding. That's a, that's a good one, Bill. I got to go.</p>", "5045": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why did you lie to me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. It just seemed funny at first and then the longer it went on, funnier it got.</p>", "5046": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I mean he only drinks milk. Like, where are the colors coming from?</p>", "5047": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> When I went by the office they gave me coffee and cookies and no one peed on me. I miss that so much.</p>", "5048": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Boy, seeing them all together like that has got my biological clock ticking like crazy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I don't think men have-<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I do.</p>", "5049": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What is this picture?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, it's an MRI of our brains photoshopped to look like they're kissing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is it too sexy?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's too something.</p>", "5050": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I just love them so much.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Me, too. My heart feels like it's gonna explode. Of course, it's full of brisket, so it probably will.</p>", "5051": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, I didn't even know I was capable of loving someone so much.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> More than me?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wha--<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Uh, I'm just messing with you. I totally love them more than you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I get that. I would take a bullet for them. But I would get seriously mutilated for you.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's sweet. But you should know, if you got seriously mutilated, I might dump you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You'd be crazy not to. Even unmutilated, I'm no prize.</p>", "5052": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, we only have two months to find a venue, and I had a thought. What about the Athenaeum club at Caltech?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Albert Einstein was a member there.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's beautiful.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, and Albert Einstein was a member there.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's close.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And Albert Einstein was a member there.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And Albert Einstein was a member there.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah. Now you sound like a woman who wants to get married.</p>", "5053": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, on one hand, they filled my tub with scented oils and brought me honeyed sweets; on the other hand, I spent my twenties incapable of talking to women. So you know, pros and cons.</p>", "5054": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did Albert Einstein ever sit in any of these chairs?<br/><strong>Kathleen:</strong> I think these are fairly new. But Stephen Hawking's eaten here a lot.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, but he brings his own chair, you know?</p>", "5055": "<p><strong>Kathleen:</strong> Here's my card. Why don't you two talk it over, and I will check to see if our soup spoons are \"deeper than they are wide\".<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What? Too deep is a ladle, not a spoon.</br></p>", "5056": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong>  I really like it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mm. Oh, I must admit, I do, as well. Look at how somber all the men in these portraits are. I feel like that sets a good tone for our wedding.</p>", "5057": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Is that Leonard?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no, no, these are all dead, accomplished scientists. Leonard will only ever be one of those things.</p>", "5058": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, good, you're here. There's (clears throat) something I want to talk to you about.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We're not putting a TV in the bathroom. That's how you get hemorrhoids.</p>", "5059": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I know you're upset, but if we want to book the Athenaeum, we really should do it now, and then, I promise, we'll have our whole lives to complain about Leonard.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aw, somebody got a head start on her vows.</p>", "5060": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> On the other hand, shaming Leonard during our wedding at the very place he betrayed me does have a beautiful symmetry to it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's nice, it'll be your first petty act as a married man.</p>", "5061": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Although, it is our wedding. Maybe it shouldn't be all about revenge.</p>", "5062": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Well, well, well. This is a pickle.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, so, if you will just move your birthday party to a different location, everything will be fine.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Ugh, it's tricky. I don't want to move my party, but I also don't want to help you. Oh, wait, I don't have a problem.</p>", "5063": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> That's not much of an apology.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, because he's not really sorry. Obviously, he wanted a place to go where I wouldn't be and apparently all of outside wasn't enough for him.</p>", "5064": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Hello, Hofstadter.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why are you cleaning that out yourself? Don't you have grad students?<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Come on, I can't make my grad students do every dirty job or so I've been told in writing by the head of Human Resources.</p>", "5065": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Barry, I've come to ask one more- Leonard? Wh-Why are you doing that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because deep down Barry is not a good guy.</p>", "5066": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I made a deal with him to get you the Athenaeum for your wedding.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why would you do that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because I was a jerk for lying to you before and besides, you're my best friend. I want you to have the wedding of your dreams.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> On Mars?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, I want Amy to have the wedding of her dreams.</p>", "5067": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We're not going to let Barry win.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, what are we going to do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We have a combined IQ of 360. Perhaps more if that radiation gave you a super brain.</p>", "5068": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, boy. I really passed out hard.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, tell me about it. The kids could've screamed bloody murder and you wouldn't have woken up. Which I know because they did.</p>", "5069": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, good news, Amy. We got the Athenaeum.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, my gosh. That's amazing. How'd you get Barry to change his mind?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I couldn't have done it without Leonard. Boy, you should've seen us in there. We were like Batman and Robin.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why do I have to be Robin?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you have to ask, you're Robin.</p>", "5070": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What happened?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, we scrubbed out some barrels of irradiated grease, rinsed off in a safety shower and then told Barry Kripke what is what.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And he just gave in?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, we agreed to invite him to the wedding.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay. No problem.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And he gets to bring a date.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, that's reasonable.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A-And if she charges by the hour, we have to cover it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What else did you agree to?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, um, you know how Barry has the voice of an angel?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> He is not singing at our wedding.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (stammers) He only wants to sing \"Volare.\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, \"Volare\". That's what he was saying. Boy, I didn't, I did not get that.</br></p>", "5071": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie? Howie, wake up. It's time.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. Did your water break?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Are you feeling any contractions?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wait. Well, where are you going?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> To the hospital. Today's my due date, and this crap needs to end now.</p>", "5072": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe today is Bernadette's due date.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah. How do you know that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Easy. 40 weeks from the date of her last period.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And why do you know that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, excuse me for taking an interest in people.</p>", "5073": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, not to brag, but Amy's last birthday brought my coital tally up to four.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Whatever you're doing, it's not bragging.</p>", "5074": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> See, see. Look at my Netflix queue. There's two documentaries and the movie Friends with Benefits, which I thought was a documentary about employer health care plans.</p>", "5075": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, we go down and back up. ... And back up!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, hearing you is not the problem.</p>", "5076": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Let me guess. You're here to try to get me to go into labor.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, please. I'm disgusted when people sneeze, and that's just stuff coming out of their nose.</p>", "5077": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Come on, baby. Get out here right now and I'll buy you a pony.</p>", "5078": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Ah, come on!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Welcome to the next five to eight weeks of your life.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sheldon, I said I didn't want to play your game.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, then don't think of it as a game. Think of it as a source of information about one of the lesser known campaigns of World War II.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're right. That's so much better.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know, right?</p>", "5079": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, first, we need to roll to determine the weather.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's a desert. Isn't it gonna be hot?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (rolling dice, looking at the manual, rolling dice again, looking at the manual again) ... Yes.</p>", "5080": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Michael? Really, you think we're naming him Michael?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Not now, Howard. I'm in the middle of a game.</p>", "5081": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> [entering the kitchen] I can't believe you're trying to hijack our son's name. [looking for Bernadette] Bernie?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> This is as fast as I move! Calm down!</p>", "5082": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What's wrong with Michael? It's my dad's name.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't want to name our son after your father.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I didn't want to say this, but he's dying.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> He is?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Eventually. I mean, you see the way the man eats.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, is this the hormones, or have you always been a lunatic?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't even know anymore.</p>", "5083": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I think I got Bernadette in trouble. Maybe we should go.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I-I can't. She and I are playing Campaign for North Africa.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (sighs) She doesn't want to play that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Neither did the Egyptians, but that didn't stop Rommel.</p>", "5084": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey! [carrying food] I brought Chinese.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> [pointing to Raj] And I brought Indian.</p>", "5085": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay, if it's not Michael, then what do you want to name him?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Harry, like Potter or Houdini.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It doesn't bother you that I have an old boyfriend named Harry?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay. How 'bout Al or Max or Ted or Kevin?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Same answer.</br></p>", "5086": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, I always thought Christian was a nice name.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. Sounds a little too uncircumcised.</p>", "5087": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What about Paul?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Paul. Paul Wolowitz.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I like it. Ooh, like \"Koothra-Paul-i.\"<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay, you ruined it.</p>", "5088": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, that moves us on to the tactical shipping phase. Penny, I believe, as logistics commander, that's you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay. [waving a white napkin] I surrender.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nice try, Penny. It takes more than everybody not enjoying it to stop a game with Sheldon Cooper.</p>", "5089": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You okay?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Uh, I think that was a contraction.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Is it time? Do we need to go to the hospital?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No. We've been through this before. My water hasn't even broken yet.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Never mind your water. Has your mucus plug popped out?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Ew, no!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, you're right. We probably would've heard that.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's not a champagne cork. Although that would be festive.</p>", "5090": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> How you feeling?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Eh. But I am really excited to meet our son.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Me, too. I thought I'd be super freaked out. But I'm ready for this. Well, not the part where you're in labor and you squeeze my fingers till they turn blue.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm sorry. That must be really painful for you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It is. I mean, last time, I- Okay, I see what you're doing.</p>", "5091": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm sorry I tried to sneak the name past you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's okay.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm sorry I used up so many good names in college. I was really competitive with my roommate.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Forget about it. Please.</p>", "5092": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You know what, maybe we're putting too much pressure on this. It doesn't matter what we name him. He's gonna be amazing.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're right. This kid is part you and part me.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah. He's gonna be smart and kind and funny.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> If he cracks five-foot-six, it'll be a miracle.</p>", "5093": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I've always liked the name Elliott.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sorry, can't have it. That's my boy name.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I said it first.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not like calling dibs.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes, it is. It's exactly like that. Dibs on Elliott.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm just saying, we might get there first. You only have sex once a year. I'll probably have sex tonight. [Penny looks at Leonard] Fine, you can have Elliott.</p>", "5094": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't worry. I don't expect you to bear them all. I'm sure we can find a suitable uterus to rent. [looks to Penny]<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh-uh!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> We weren't thinking about you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course not. (grunts) I am going to the kitchen. Can I get anybody anything? Penny, nice glass of milk and a multivitamin?</p>", "5095": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Honey, babies don't always come on their due date. Halley was two weeks late. [seeing Bernadette's stare] But this baby's a boy. They don't take as long to get ready.</p>", "5096": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> If you really want to help, put on a rubber glove, reach on up there and start pulling.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know you're joking, but I grew up on a farm. I'll do it.</p>", "5097": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Suez? Birth? It's a big night for canals.</p>", "5098": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> When did you pick out our kids' names?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Remember that day you moved into the building?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (chuckles) Yes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> A non-creepy amount of time after that.</p>", "5099": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I thought we were having dinner at Leonard and Penny's.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no. No, they're watching the new Professor Proton. I can't keep Wil Wheaton off the Internet, but I can keep him off my retinas.</p>", "5100": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know which Hemsworth is playing Logan Dean, but I know it's a Hemsworth.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, Logan's actually based on me.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> So a young Paul Giamatti.</br></p>", "5101": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, what if I watch it with you? Maybe I won't like it and we can complain about it together.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Get your own thing to complain about.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, trust me, I've got one.</p>", "5102": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What's that noise?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, it's my new keyboard. It looks and sounds like an old-fashioned typewriter. It makes me feel like a real novelist.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You poured yourself a Scotch.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Apple juice.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But unsweetened, like Hemingway used to drink.</p>", "5103": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, Professor Proton.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Hey, thanks for being here.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No problem. I'm on my \"launch\" break.</p>", "5104": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> And then, when the lights come back on in the supercollider room, Dr. Logan Dean makes two important discoveries, gluino (gruffly) and murder.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, gluino. That's exciting.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (gruffly) And murder.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (gruffly) I heard you. The first time.</p>", "5105": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So, does Penny know you based a character on her?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What character?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Ilsa, the head of the institute. That's clearly Penny.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, it's not.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Really? Confident, ball-busting beauty who's always rolling her eyes at Logan?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Trust me, that describes more women than you think.</p>", "5106": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm just a regular guy, with a regular enemies list. Which, by the way, you are no longer on.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Really? Well, that is something. It's not something that I care about, but it is something.</p>", "5107": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wil Wheaton wants you to be on Professor Proton.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's nice, but I'm not really interested.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What do you mean? But he wants to talk about women in science. You're a woman, you're in science. You go, girl.</p>", "5108": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Boy, I don't know how people who aren't on bed rest keep up with the Kardashians.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, sometimes you have to read in your car while your husband thinks you're working late.</p>", "5109": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I just learned some very distressing news. Sometimes, Amy doesn't do things because she's worried about how I'll react.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> First of all, it's not sometimes, it's always.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Second, it's not Amy, it's everybody.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And third, it's not news, it's well-established.</p>", "5110": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah. Like just now I wanted to get a croissant, but I didn't want to hear you say, \"Ooh, la, la.\"</p>", "5111": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So you're saying everyone walks on eggshells to spare my feelings?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, of course not, because we don't want to hear you complain about how much you hate the sound of crunching eggshells.</p>", "5112": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, regardless, I can change.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, of course you can.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, everybody thinks I'm so predictable. Well, tomorrow I'm gonna show up at work and do something no one will expect.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wear a baseball cap backwards to prove your point?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> ... Yes, but which hat?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Gryffindor.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, now that you guessed it, I'm not gonna do it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, you will.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah.</p>", "5113": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry. It's, I'm trying to show you that I can change. I don't want you to miss out on things because of me.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I know you don't.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, and maybe somewhere out there, there is a little girl who will see you on Wil's show and realize that she, too, can grow up to be a brilliant, amazing, successful scientist.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who is really terrible at chess.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Got it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, no, no. I mean really bad. What was your queen doing over there, going shopping?</p>", "5114": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Well, that is our show for today. And I want to say a very special thank you to Dr. Amy Fowler for being here. It was a real pleasure having you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And you can feel that pleasure because you don't have a lesion in your nucleus accumbens.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> I really hope I don't.</p>", "5115": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Look at this cute picture of Halley in the bath.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aw, that's great.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Want me to send it to you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, on your phone it's cute, on my phone it's a crime.</br></p>", "5116": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Maybe we're being old-fashioned, defining these roles by gender. You know, historically, the best man's role was to defend the bride and groom in combat. I mean, if that's not Penny, I don't know what we're doing here.</p>", "5117": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's really sweet of you to come by and keep me company.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Agreed.</p>", "5118": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, listen, I have a secret that I need to tell someone. But you can never say a word. Not even to Howard.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm your girl. Lay it on me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? You keep things from your husband?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, I tell him everything. Don't be a child.</p>", "5119": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. Here it is. I can control the thermostat in Leonard's apartment with my phone. And when he makes me mad, I turn it up, slightly.</p>", "5120": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, hey. I didn't know you were here. What are you two talking about?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Literally, nothing interesting.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> [whispering] Oh, you're good.</p>", "5121": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, what you doing?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh. Sheldon gave me a brain teaser. It's kind of fun. It's about a group of people at dinner, and you have to figure out where they can sit without fighting.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, yeah, is this the one where Mr. Green can't sit next to anyone eating meat, and Uncle Light Blue won't sit next to any of the darker colors?</p>", "5122": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, did Sheldon send it to you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Amy did. I solved it already.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. Same way I solved my jury duty summons, I threw it away.</p>", "5123": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did Sheldon and Amy give you guys that puzzle, too?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah. Is it just me or have they been acting strange?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't think they're acting.</p>", "5124": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just out of curiosity, which one of you figured it out?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I did.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Impressive. [rubs out Howard's score on the leaderboard]</p>", "5125": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So, bottom line, what you did was wrong and cruel, which the mother of my children finds oddly appealing.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So she still wants to be my maid of honor?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maid of honor, hit woman, whatever you need. Make the call.</p>", "5126": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So as to not upset any of you further, I've asked Stuart to be my best man, and he's agreed. You're all still invited to the bachelor party. Uh, he's thinking Costco and the theme is browsing.</p>", "5127": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, can you do me a favor? Can we try to avoid talking to our friends tonight about our wedding plans?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll do you one better. I'll avoid talking to our friends entirely and play on my phone.</p>", "5128": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> It's just, I haven't picked a maid of honor yet, and I'm having trouble deciding between Penny and Bernadette.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah, understandable. They are quite similar - both blond former waitresses who married beneath them.</p>", "5129": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So if anyone brings it up tonight, just maybe you can help me change the subject.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How about this? I dominate the conversation so hard, no one has a chance to get a word in edgewise.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't know. They might see that coming.</p>", "5130": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, what am I gonna do about my maid of honor? I mean, Bernadette gave me all these bridal magazines. She even folded down the pages with the good dresses.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm. Hmm. I get it. You know, Leonard once borrowed my Edmund Scientific catalogue and dog-eared some pages. Never got 'em straight again.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, that is exactly the same thing. You really understand my dilemma.</br></p>", "5131": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How are we gonna make these decisions without anybody getting upset?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, what if we take emotion out of the process, and base it on empirical metrics? Then we aren't really making the decision; the data is.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So we can hurt our friends' feelings without taking any responsibility? Me likey.</p>", "5132": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> But how do we apply quantitative metrics to something as subjective as choosing a wedding party?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That decision only seems subjective. In reality, people in a wedding party perform very specific functions, and some will perform those better than others. If I may use a superhero analogy-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You may not.</p>", "5133": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So we break down each of the roles into their component parts, and then design specialized tests for each.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Exactly. Boy, if I had known getting married was going to involve so much science, I'd have proposed years ago.</p>", "5134": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I would say that this constitutes a catering crisis.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I agree. Who's gonna step up and handle it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Doesn't matter. This is fine.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Penny? <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (mouth full) What?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know what? I'll take care of it.</p>", "5135": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me, b-before we start eating, I-I would like to make a toast.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, nice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If only I could think of one. Someone else go.</p>", "5136": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey. Here's the sewing kit you asked for.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ooh! A minute, 19. Quick.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You were timing me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. I am going through a bit of a timing phase. How long will it last? We'll find out.</p>", "5137": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm only saying this because I love you and because you can't reach me from that bed, but you sound a little crazy.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I love you, too, but I could fling this card in your eye like a ninja throwing star.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't believe you. (covers his eyes and backs out of the room)</p>", "5138": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He wasn't insane.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He did fall in love with a pigeon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, if we're gonna call Tesla crazy for loving something small and unappealing, might as well put Penny in a padded cell right now.</p>", "5139": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, Howard, are you interested?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Are you kidding? If I could control robot arms with my brain, I'd be able to do so many things.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? Because you've been controlling human arms with your brain for years and not much has come of it.</p>", "5140": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (imitates a siren wailing)<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. Uh, French police?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, so close. Belgian ambulance.</p>", "5141": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're not jealous of Howard, are you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course not. The only engineer I'm jealous of is the one who blows the train whistle. Ooh, that just gave me an idea for a new game, \"What whistle am I?\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Train.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For your information, it was going to be tea kettle, but the tea kettle was on a train, so I'll give it to you.</p>", "5142": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> If we add phase detection to your EEG sensors, I'll have to rewrite most of the code.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Can you do that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, these hands were made to do three things: close-up magic, writing code, and the dirty shadow puppet show that got me kicked out of Hebrew school.</p>", "5143": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What do you want?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I just wish I could make Howard feel as angry as I'm feeling.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, maybe you could do something he likes and make him jealous.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Like what?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Have you ever read Tom Sawyer?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Chores. He likes chores.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ooh. What kind of chores?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, you could change the batteries in the smoke detectors. That would drive him crazy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's great. Oh, he'll be so mad smoke will be coming out of his ears. And then the smoke detectors will detect it.</p>", "5144": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I stopped by to see if you wanted to go to the movies with me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, I'd love to, but we're just about to test the interface. It could take a while.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, buddy, it-- it's not my place, but Bernadette's been feeling a little abandoned with all the hours that you've been putting in.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You just asked him to go to the movies.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, but our weird relationship was grandfathered into their marriage, and yours was not.</p>", "5145": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What are you talking about? Howard hates doing chores.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, then why would Bernadette tell me that - (gasps) Bernadette. Did you play on my well established gullibility to clean your house?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sure did.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I would storm out of here, but I already have the gloves and the steel wool, and I really do love cleaning an oven.</br></p>", "5146": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, that is a good point. I'm really proud of the way you're able to express your feelings.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you. I'm just so angry.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, everyone gets angry. Even mommies and daddies.</p>", "5147": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, and, Penny, she kinda threw up on your stuffed bear.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's okay.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey. That's an Ewok and it's mine.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, which is why it's okay.</p>", "5148": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I used to have the stuffed raccoon from Guardians of the Galaxy, but Cinnamon licked it raw.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> There's a time and place for your randy dog stories, and it's never and nowhere.</p>", "5149": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, Beverly.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oh, hello, Penny.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, Leonard just left. He's gonna be so upset he missed your call.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Because he ... Yeah, I don't know.</p>", "5150": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Anyway as angry as I was with him leaving, building this stuff is probably what led me to become an engineer.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I suppose, in his own way, my dad also encouraged me to pursue science. I mean, he is the one that taught me that flatulence is combustible. And also, polyester gym shorts don't burn. They melt.</p>", "5151": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So, you don't want to hang out with Sheldon and Howard?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, they were bonding over their sad childhoods, and my stupid parents were always there for me.</p>", "5152": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, well, you know, I'm here for you. What do you want to talk about?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Well, last time, we focused on my life. If we're going to be real girlfriends, we should talk about you as well.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, you know, if we're gonna be real girlfriends, we should get a third girl we can trash behind her back.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oh, so we'd be catty. Oh, I like it. What about Sheldon's fiancee She seems a bit dour.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, \"dour\". Meow!</p>", "5153": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, that's perfect. I mean, the one thing I thought I could do with my son, I can't even do that right.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, if you want to see it again, I got it on video. Looks pretty cool in slow motion.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thank you for your support.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're welcome.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I was being sarcastic.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How dare you!</p>", "5154": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Reason number 13 to feel good: as a launch, it was bad, but as an explosion, it was glorious. Reason 14: you still have all your fingers, and boys prefer a dad with fingers.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thanks for trying, but you're not gonna be able to cheer me up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, how about this, then? You quit your whining before I give you something to cry about, young man.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Those are comforting words my father would often say.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Did it help?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I turned out great. You tell me.</p>", "5155": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Let's get going.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you gonna be this mopey all the way home?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know, maybe.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There any chance you'd be cheered up by an amazing trigonometry riddle? (silence) Well, if you can't answer that, there's no way you're gonna get this riddle.</p>", "5156": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, really? Is she FaceTiming with you right now? Because she's FaceTiming with my mom, and believe me, that is not a face you want to spend time with.</p>", "5157": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, Penny's your favorite?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I suppose she is. You married well, Leonard, and for that I am proud of you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't- I don't- I don't know what to say.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I'm also proud of how hard you're trying not to cry.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (choking up) Thank you.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Would you like to hang up now?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, here it comes.</p>", "5158": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I can't believe you went behind my back!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Which clearly means I want this more!<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> You want to play a game of \"who's more desperate\" with me? 'Cause you're in the big leagues now, Bucko.</p>", "5159": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm just saying maybe there's a part of you deep down that just wants to relax a little, you know? Kick back. Say, \"Whatev.\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Whatev? I'm sorry, you're really not gonna finish that word?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm just trying to make a point-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Finish the word, Amy.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Fine. Er. Er, er, er.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you. Only now you owe me three more whatevs.</p>", "5160": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What are you listening to?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Nothing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, come on, I want to hear.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (on a recording) We don't need GPS. Let's just see where the road takes us.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I see why you turned it off. That guy sounds like an idiot.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Honey, that's you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't be silly. My voice is deep and sonorous. Like a Caucasian James Earl Jones. \"Luke, I am your father.\" See?</br></p>", "5161": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, look, I think that she and I have more in common.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Because you're Indian? So just 'cause she's brown, you get to date her?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes! And the next time we meet a woman who's pale and cadaver-like, she's all yours.</p>", "5162": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, this isn't your laundry night.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know. Laundry on a Wednesday. It's the madness my life has become.</p>", "5163": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Why is this sleep-talking thing bothering you anyway?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's simple. I don't like the idea that my mind might be keeping an entire personality from me.<br/>\nDr. Jekyll's other personality was Mr. Hyde. Mr. Hyde. Didn't have a postgraduate degree.</p>", "5164": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. Well, assuming you're right, what would you suggest I do?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I would start with something small, see if it makes your life any better. Um, you can learn to meditate, take a yoga class.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, you know, I have always been intrigued by flip-flops. The official footwear of the laid-back fellow.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, sure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course if my feet are gonna be exposed, I'll need to update my tetanus booster.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, yeah. Makes sense.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah. And while I'm there, I may as well get a flu shot and a mole check.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sure. You know, I've never had a mole check.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ooh! Well, it's been nice knowing you.</p>", "5165": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, new business. Do we grant Laid-back Sheldon a seat on the council?<br/><strong>Laid-back </strong><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, whatever you guys want. I'm just chillin' like Bob Dylan.</p>", "5166": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> The more I told him about my lab, the pissier he got. You know what he said to me? He said, \"I hope all your correlations turn out to be specious.\"<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> He said that to your face? What a dick.</p>", "5167": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You're right. We both do important work. I'm trying to map the structures of the brain and you're trying to convince people that itchy hair is a real thing.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It is a real thing! It happens to be a side effect of our cholesterol drug.</p>", "5168": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> There's Leonard. I'll bet he's having a rough day.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Let's just try to be supportive.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Supportive? He publicly maligned the love of my life, Lady Physics.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You might not want to mention that to Lady Fiance.</p>", "5169": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, come on, look, you said a few dumb things on the radio-- what is the worst that could happen?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I may get fired.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, well, even if you did, you could find another job.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, who wouldn't want to hire the physicist who publicly said physics is dead?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I wouldn't put that under \"special skills.\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can fix it, I just need to write a retraction I don't believe in. Basically sell out to keep my job.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Great, I'll leave you to it.</p>", "5170": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> We're here. What's going on?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay. As far as I can see, science is dead, 'cause Leonard killed it. And, uh, I don't know who the Romulans are, but those guys know how to party.</p>", "5171": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Boo-hoo. You know what you sound like? Babies. Two whiny babies. And there's nothing worse than being stuck with two whiny babies!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. Oh, my God, I'm gonna have two babies.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, no, no, no. Babies are great. You're lucky to have two babies. I mean, look at me, uh, I'm all alone.<br/>\nI'm never gonna have babies, 'cause you can't make a baby watching Netflix with your dog.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thanks for coming.</p>", "5172": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> But you did ask my father?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I did. He said yes. Although, not in a robot voice, so it wasn't nearly as cool.</p>", "5173": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> This is my fiance, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. That's the first time I've said that and it kind of gave me the goose bumps.</p>", "5174": "<p><strong>Dr. Harris:</strong> Amy, I recently read your paper on lesions in the olfactory receptors in the brain. It was inspired.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, well, I guess it didn't stink. But if it did, that rat wouldn't have known it.</p>", "5175": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know what, Sheldon? You're not always the smartest person in every room. You may not even be the smartest person in this room.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I am sorry. What, is Neil deGrasse Tyson hiding behind the couch? 'Cause if he is, he's not that smart, it's pretty dusty back there.</br></p>", "5176": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Obviously, it was a surprise. There was some crying and some yelling.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Some suggestion of make-up sex that did not go over well, even though it's not like we can get more pregnant.</p>", "5177": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It's just it's hard talking to my other friends about this, but I knew you would understand.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Why is that?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Because you and I are both alone, which is actually kind of comforting, because at least we can be alone together.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Mm. This is, this is awkward. I, um, I was actually gonna close up a little early tonight 'cause I have a date.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (clears throat) Forgive me if I'm having trouble being happy for you.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Don't be silly, I'm loving your pain.</p>", "5178": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Anyway, I'm proud of you. And I'm going to try to do a better job of sharing the spotlight because we're a team. You know? Much like the Dodgers. If they had superpowers, and fought crime. And Thor was in them.</p>", "5179": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, maybe, um, I should start right now, and go back to Pasadena and let you have this experience to yourself.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You just want to go back 'cause that's where everybody makes a fuss over you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, your colleagues are right, you are brilliant.</p>", "5180": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You actually got in a pool?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was scared, but I told myself it's just a big bathtub. Then I got scared again 'cause there are all these strangers in my bathtub.</p>", "5181": "<p><strong>Ramona Nowitzki:</strong> I was proud of him. A lot of people don't put their face in the water on the first day.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I was hiding from a bee, but it still counts.</p>", "5182": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What just happened?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> A stranger just lured Sheldon away with a candy bar.</p>", "5183": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry you had to go through that.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> In fact, that's when I started to really miss you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know you just split an infinitive.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Did I? Are you gonna teach me a lesson?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am. It is naughty to put an adverb between the word \"to\" and the verb stem.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What are you gonna do about it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm going to admonish you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Vigorously?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's the only kind of admonishing I do.</p>", "5184": "<p><strong>Ramona Nowitzki:</strong> Are these all from Peter Higgs?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm? Oh, no, no, no. They're from many famous people. See? Oh, like this one. This is from Patrick Stewart. It says if I come to his house again, I get to meet his dogs.</p>", "5185": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, I hate to break up the party, but Amy says I'm tired and have to go to bed.</p>", "5186": "<p><strong>Ramona Nowitzki:</strong> Hey, did you eat yet?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, breakfast yes, lunch no. I did have a cough drop, but that really rides the line between sucking and eating.</p>", "5187": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've learned some fun facts about New Jersey to help you make small talk. Would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate? They're both shocking.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Actually, I want to hear about you. How are things at home?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I'm a lot less likely to see an Eastern Goldfinch or be murdered, I'll tell you that.</p>", "5188": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> How's Sheldon doing with Amy gone?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, the last three nights I've had to take him to get a haircut, to the train store, and to a Walgreens in Arcadia where they still have the \"good ibuprofen.\" Now, ask me how I'm doing with Amy gone.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How are you doing with-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Shut up.</p>", "5189": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Tonight he wants to look at ladders at Home Depot.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, why does he need a ladder?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He doesn't; he just likes looking at them. Bring a book.</p>", "5190": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Gentlemen, you may remember Dr. Nowitzki. She's back at Caltech for her postdoc.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Ramona Nowitzki:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hi. Oh, let me bring a chair for you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, thanks. Dr. Nowitzki's going to tell me about the work she did at CERN. And she brought me this duty-free Toblerone.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh. I love those.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (To Ramona) Let's sit somewhere else.</br></p>", "5191": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait, isn't she the grad student that used to follow him around?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, yeah. Back before he hit puberty and grew man parts.</p>", "5192": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> He just made her laugh, something's wrong.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Do you see the way she's looking at him?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah. Like Bernadette used to look at me.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I keep telling you, close the bathroom door.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ah, did you see that? She just touched his hand and he didn't swat it away. What is happening? <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, the simplest explanation is usually the right one.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Which is?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That ain't Sheldon.</p>", "5193": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, then we agree. He's not making any moves, it's this Dr. Ramona chick.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Nowitzki. I Googled her, she's pretty cute.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? All I got from Leonard was the Toblerone bar had nuts.</p>", "5194": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, what do you want us to do?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't know. Might be the New Jersey talking, but this Nowitzki broad needs to disappear.</p>", "5195": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> It's unbelievable. Sheldon has lunch with another woman and somehow my wife yells at me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny laid into me, too. Apparently, I'm overly fixated on premium Swiss chocolate bars.</p>", "5196": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Can you even eat those things?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If I take a Lactaid a half-hour before and some Pepto right after.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sounds like a lot of work.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Eh, I'm worth it.</p>", "5197": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Should we do something about Nowitzki?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Like what?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, she's single, so if somebody else asks her out and she says yes, then we know she's not into Sheldon.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'll do it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No offense, Stuart, but the woman's a doctor.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> So? Doctors like me. Whenever I see mine he calls in a bunch of other doctors to have a look.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She's not that kind of doctor.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh. Well, her loss. I've been called a genuine medical oddity.</p>", "5198": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Dr. Nowitzki. Good to see you.<br/><strong>Ramona Nowitzki:</strong> Good to see you, too.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> May I join you?<br/><strong>Ramona Nowitzki:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Good to see you.</p>", "5199": "<p><strong>Iris scanner:</strong> Leonard Hofstadter. Access granted.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hmm. I don't care if this thing's burning out my retinas; it makes me feel special.</p>", "5200": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Now, before we field test, I think we --<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What the hell?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where is everything?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who else has access to this room?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's a secure lab in a classified facility; only the U.S. government and us.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is very disconcerting.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But the movie did just get good.</p>", "5201": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sir, I-I-I'm sorry but I just don't get it. You came into our lab in the middle of the night and took our prototype and all of our research and didn't even tell us?<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Sounds like you get it.</p>", "5202": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I may be moving out soon. I think I found a place to live.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really? You kept sending me apartment listings.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Um, well, I- Yeah, you got me.</p>", "5203": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> How can you work on something for a year and they just take it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can't believe the Air Force would treat us like that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, I have a good mind to stop paying my taxes. It's too bad I enjoy doing them so much.</p>", "5204": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The Air Force did it again. They're erasing our lives!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Third floor, wrong apartment.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Although, if anyone's gonna clean out your apartment and disappear, it'd be Penny.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She might disappear, but she's definitely not cleaning anything.</p>", "5205": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I mean, an entire year wasted.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You might be forgetting another accomplishment of the past year.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. Yeah, yeah, we brought life into the world.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Really? That's the importance you put on us having a baby?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm happy about it, but, I mean, it's not like I did much. I mean, after the first three minutes it was pretty much all you.</br></p>", "5206": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I may have lost my guidance system and my girlfriend, but I still have a colon full of yesterday's meals to keep me company. Although, thanks to your high-fiber breakfast, I'm sure that'll be leaving me, too.</p>", "5207": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're still gonna go, right?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't know. Sheldon's so vulnerable right now.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, come on. Look, if the roles were reversed, he'd be on the first train to New Jersey. Or the second train if there were teenagers on the first one.</p>", "5208": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, distance might be nice. The last time a big project ended for Howie, he wouldn't stop following me around. He even went with me to get a mammogram.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, what's wrong with that?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, he wanted to get one with me, like some kind of weird couple's massage.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And yet you bore his child. Neato.</p>", "5209": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, you're being silly.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Am I? Yesterday I had an Air Force project, a girlfriend who lived with me, and my good friend Raj right across the hall.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you really care about that last one?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, but that list was sounding a little thin.</p>", "5210": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't know if you realize this, but whenever you're between projects, you tend to get a little insecure.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> A little clingy.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I know and I'm sorry. (starts kissing her)<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, oh, oh, okay, stop. Stop. I love when you're affectionate, but this is not coming from a good place.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (laughing) Well, excuse me, but what did you do when you worked on that allergy drug for two years and the FDA shut down your project?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I signed us up for ballroom dance class.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, and what did you do when they took you off the anti-fungal team?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I made us have a baby.</p>", "5211": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So what happens next?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Phase two: we test it, perfect it, and hope to live long enough to see the movie based on our lives starring more attractive versions of us.</p>", "5212": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Want me to put on some Neil Diamond? That always makes you feel better.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No. You'll get all sexed up, and I'm not in the mood.</p>", "5213": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, then. Let's go to the bedroom, remove our clothes, fold them neatly, and engage in frenzied lovemaking.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What if we don't fold our clothes at all.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I d- ... or what if we fold them?</p>", "5214": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We're pinned down!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We can't get through!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon, get over here and help!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, one second.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, why are you jumping up and down?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm trying to shoot.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Then use the shoot button, not the \"wonderful thing about Tiggers\" button!</p>", "5215": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What happened to me? I used to excel at these things.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Kids are always better at video games.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I don't like it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If it makes you feel better, you still dress like a child.</p>", "5216": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I know how you feel. I tried one of those electronic Japanese toilets, practically shot myself across the room.</p>", "5217": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Penny?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, Zack. Hey.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> What are the odds of running into you here?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, it's a bar, so pretty good.</p>", "5218": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> How about you? Hey, how's Leonard? Is he still smart?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes, yes, he's working for the government on an infinite persistence gyroscope. Of course, the first time I say it right, he's not even here.</p>", "5219": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Now, this is rare. I don't know which one of you I want to stop talking first.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The theory is that if you really tax your brain, the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Like JLo's hair.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Boy, it is neck and neck right now.</p>", "5220": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> If you really want to challenge yourself, you could learn to speak Hindi.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Jab mein aat saal ka tha Maine seekha tha.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Could you say that in English? I actually, I never learned Hindi.</br></p>", "5221": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, you ready to go?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, I guess.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What's the matter?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Honestly? It's a little strange having dinner with your ex-boyfriend, and it's not like we have a lot to talk about.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What? He loves you, okay? And he's interested in your work. You could talk about the infinite perspective -- I swear I know it.</p>", "5222": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You want a real challenge, try keeping me from eating more of these.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're just using food to mask the fear that you're fundamentally unlovable and therefore going to be alone forever.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Damn it, he's good at that, too.</p>", "5223": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> So, Penny, what's going on with you? How's the job?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, it's okay, I'm still in pharmaceutical sales.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She's doing amazing. She can actually make a side effect, like 10% chance of liver failure, sound like a 90% chance of liver success.</p>", "5224": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, lying isn't my favorite part of the job. Actually, I'm not crazy about a lot of it.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Hey, if you're not happy there, I've been looking for a new head of sales at my company. And we don't sell drugs, just menus, so the only lie you'll be telling is we print on recycled paper. We don't.</p>", "5225": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, this is everything. What do you want to learn?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It really doesn't matter, as long as it's challenging.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, well, how about, oh, I teach you some close-up magic.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard, I'm trying to make myself uncomfortable, not everyone else.</p>", "5226": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So you wanted to learn something physical and you came to Howard Wolowitz?</p>", "5227": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're not really considering working for him, are you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, maybe, I mean, it seems kind of perfect. I have sales experience, and I've been a waitress, so I have restaurant experience, and if he's figuring out my Christmas bonus, we could buy a boat.</p>", "5228": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, look, I'm on a unicycle!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> How did you get from croissants to a unicycle?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I hurt myself juggling.</p>", "5229": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So he's my ex-boyfriend, who cares? I can't believe Leonard would be so insecure.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Really? I have no trouble believing that at all.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And Zack's engaged. Leonard has no reason to feel threatened.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We're talking about the same Leonard, right?</p>", "5230": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So you think it's fine if she works for Zack?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. Maybe.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, he is much more attractive than Leonard.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes, but that's gonna be true of a lot of guys she works for.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, but she also used to sleep with Zack.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Again...</p>", "5231": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I would never let Howard work with an ex.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What, you wouldn't trust him?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I wouldn't trust her. He's thin and sexy like a Jewish greyhound.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, that - that is the sexiest dog.</p>", "5232": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> And I'd like to think Howie wouldn't take a job I was uncomfortable with.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> 'Cause he's scared of you?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Terrified.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah.</p>", "5233": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, is it possible that when things get really difficult, you just give up?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you calling me a quitter?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, if you honestly-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This conversation is over.</p>", "5234": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I made you tea.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm sorry I called you a quitter.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's okay, I stopped being upset about that. And no, the irony is not lost on me.</p>", "5235": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Penny, what's up?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, uh, so I've been thinking about it and I want to take the job.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Oh, bad news. When my fiance found out that I was offering a job to my ex-girlfriend, she said it was a stupid idea and threw a shoe at me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, so there's no job?<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Nope, just a little bump on my forehead.</br></p>", "5236": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, and I'm a dork for juggling.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sorry, you're not a dork. (Southern accent): You're a clown. (Regular voice): Tammy Jo, don't say that, you'll make him feel bad. (Southern accent): Look at him, what reason he got to feel good?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, very funny.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Don't listen to her, she's been in a box for, like, 25 years. (chuckles) (Southern accent) Yeah, back when his haircut was fashionable.</p>", "5237": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Do you have a bodyguard to keep spies away?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I have Sheldon, that keeps most people away.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> I miss that guy. He's like the Swedish Chef Muppet. I don't know what he's saying, but he's funny.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I know what he's saying, and he's not, he's not funny.</p>", "5238": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So you wanted to learn something physical and you came to Howard Wolowitz?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, the circus arts are very physically and mentally demanding. Have you ever tried to juggle?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yes, I'm juggling my love for you and my embarrassment of you right now.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And it's hard, isn't it?</p>", "5239": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Shall we?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, my God. It's light, it's flaky, it's buttery. You don't need to have sex with him, just eat one of these.</p>", "5240": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> When I go back to work, we're gonna leave her with these people. We don't know anything about them.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> They're highly-trained educators with background checks. They're even required to be current on all vaccinations.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> You leave her with me, and I'm not any of those things.</p>", "5241": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, Sheldon says you have a new girlfriend.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, which he rudely announced on my flag show. People were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night.</p>", "5242": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, we're all having dinner tonight. Why don't the two of you join us?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, wa-- Hold on. We don't know anything about this woman.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> What do you want to know?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is she a geologist?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, great. See you at 7:00.</p>", "5243": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's not just the sloth. Polar bears nurse their cubs for almost eight months. The orangutan mother builds her baby a new home every night. And what do I do? I choose my career over my child!<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> (To Howard) Told you we should have gone to Legoland.</p>", "5244": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't you have any friends he can date?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, I already set up Howard and Bernadette. It's your turn to ruin some poor girl's life.</p>", "5245": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Look, if you're not ready to go back to work, we'll figure something out.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, I'll be fine.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> It might be good for her. Howard's mother was around him all the time, and he's a world-class mama's boy.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (scoffs) I mean, wh-why would you say that?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Go ahead, have a tantrum; that'll prove me wrong.</p>", "5246": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It would be nice to raise Halley to be a little more independent than you were.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I guess. It wasn't until college that I learned you can put a thermometer in your mouth.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> On that charming note, dinner is served.</p>", "5247": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So how did you two meet?<br/><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Oh, it's such a cute story! We met on a dating Web site.<br/>\n(silence)<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is that it?<br/><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Oh, sorry. The end.</p>", "5248": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, Rebecca, how did you become a personal trainer?<br/><strong>Rebecca:</strong> I came to Los Angeles to be an actress, and things didn't really work out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'd say she's copying you again, but I'm getting tired of sitting in the hall.</p>", "5249": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay, sweetie, Mommy's gonna go to work now, so you have fun today.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I told her if day care is anything like prison, find the biggest baby and knock him out.</p>", "5250": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Bye, cutie. I'm gonna miss you. (voice breaking) I'm gonna be waiting right here tonight when you get home.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Stop, you're gonna make me cry.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (voice breaking) Great, now everybody's crying.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> At least Halley's not.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's good.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> She's not gonna see us all day, and she doesn't even care!</br></p>", "5251": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Is it weird if we just stand here and watch her all day?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Probably.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> We should go.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Or we could take her to the aquarium.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'll get her, you grab her bag.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hang on, Halley, we're busting you out of there!</p>", "5252": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> I made a huge mistake.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, you didn't. Okay? Look, Bert, when I had money, I dated lots of girls who weren't right for me. And then I gave up my money, and now I'm alone, and living with my friends, and somebody else should probably talk now.</p>", "5253": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Guess who's home from day care?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's Halley. Unless somebody else put an \"X\" on the bottom of their kid's foot.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You realize they called when you took her.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (singsongy) Guess who's home from the aquarium?</p>", "5254": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I feel bad for Bert.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So he's using his money to attract a mate. Is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract Amy? Or Leonard using his power of groveling to get Penny?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's totally different. Bert's money might run out, but I can beg until the end of time.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All that, and he's shorter than me.</p>", "5255": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Based on the glowing reception of our recent Behind the Flags retrospective, we thought you might like to see how it all came together.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So welcome to tonight's episode,<br/><strong>Both:</strong> Fun with Flags - Behind the \"Behind the Flags: A Retrospective\" Retrospective.</p>", "5256": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What if she likes the people who work there more than us?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She already likes soap bubbles more than us.</p>", "5257": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So is this your first time dating a scientist? 'Cause I'm thinking of starting a support group.<br/><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Actually, I'm not new to this. I was engaged to a Scientologist.</p>", "5258": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> She was also interested in walking around my house in her underwear. Now the only one that does that is me.</p>", "5259": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, Leonard, if you're not busy tomorrow, I have to do a little reception after work.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I would, but we need to make a push on the air force project.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, are you sure? We're celebrating our new A.D.D. drug, and it'll probably be over in, like, six minutes.</p>", "5260": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sorry, what is this plan you have?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I'm not needed at both places at the same time. And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks, such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> When does that start?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Soon. See, I could've said \"in the near future,\" but I didn't say \"in the near future,\" 'cause \"in the near future\" is three more words than \"soon.\" \"In\" one, \"the\" two, \"near\" three, \"future\" four. See \"in the near future\" is four, \"soon\" is just one, four is more than one; saving time already.</p>", "5261": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Genius. I was gonna say, \"Why does anyone think Sheldon's a genius?\" But I didn't.</p>", "5262": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah, I'm back, you got me for eight minutes.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, this is silly. You can't expect us to do quality work with you popping in and out like this.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The coefficient isn't lambda, it's lambda sub one. And over here, you should consider the possibility that the brain itself is in two different quantum states. And lastly, do you have any little soup crackers?</p>", "5263": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> What you working on?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Trying to catch up on office e-mails before I go back.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, that's right, maternity leave's almost over. Are you excited?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I'll miss Halley, but it'll be nice to get out of the house, be intellectually stimulated. Go out to lunch instead of, you know, (points to her breasts) being lunch.</p>", "5264": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Uh, other than burp you or give you a bottle, I don't know what to do right now.</p>", "5265": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, what's for dinner?<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Meatloaf.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (half-heartedly) Oh, cool.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Stuart made it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (upbeat) Oh, cool.</br></p>", "5266": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Speaking of which, for day care, it'll be easy for me to drop her off, unless you want to do it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hmm, guess it should be me.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I can't do it; they have a picture of me on file now.</p>", "5267": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We came home from work and we found you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Home from work? What time is it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's 9 o'clock.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> 9?! What happened to 8 and 7 and all the other o'clocks?</p>", "5268": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's it. I'm in breach of my security clearance. I'm going to prison. And you know what happens to people like me in prison. I'll be forced to be some large man's tutor.</p>", "5269": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Wait a minute. Hey, let me see your phone.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, it's possible it was tracking everywhere you went.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Phones can do that?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, it depends on the privacy settings.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, tha- that's so cool. How do you- how do you turn that thing off? (laughing nervously)<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Relax. I know when you \"go for a run,\" you stop for a donut.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't even run there, I drive.</p>", "5270": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I just don't know what the right thing to do is. If I go back to work, I'm abandoning Halley. If I don't go, I'm giving up everything I worked for. It's like there's no right choice.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Look, I don't know what the best decision is, either. But whatever we choose, if we're not happy, we can undo it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I guess.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And the best part is: Halley won't remember a thing. (laughs) Babies are cute, but they're dumb.<br/>\n(chuckles) I mean, I go like this, she thinks I'm gone. Then magically I'm back. I mean, honestly, why are we saving for college?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm not crazy about you calling our baby dumb.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, she gets it from me.</p>", "5271": "<p><strong>Bartender:</strong> You gonna buy another round for the house?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, no, thank you. (To Leonard) We now know why MasterCard sent me a fraud alert.</p>", "5272": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ask him.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Um, yes. Howdy, partner. Do you happen to recollect if I left a notebook in these here parts?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> These here parts?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's called fitting in. By the way, good luck.</p>", "5273": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Did you say you guys are working on the guidance system tomorrow?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, why?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, Sheldon said that he was gonna work with me on our quantum perception project.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We've had this planned for a week.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, he reconfirmed with me this morning.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Guys, before this gets ugly, remember, the winner gets Sheldon.</p>", "5274": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, downward-facing dog comes from the Sanskrit phrase adho mukha shvanasana.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's beautiful. What does it mean?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> \"Downward-facing dog.\"<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I guess they don't have Sanskrit for \"butts up and heads down.\"<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, we wrote the Kama Sutra. If it involves butts, there's a word for it.</p>", "5275": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I thought we were getting breakfast before work.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, right, sorry.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's my fault. I asked Penny to do yoga with me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> If you want, I can get ready in five minutes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (chuckles) It's cute that you think that.</p>", "5276": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, can I ask you a favor? Would you mind taking Cinnamon for a walk?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure. You're living here for free. I guess I owe you.</p>", "5277": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I picked it up without thinking about it. Which raises a neuro-scientific question, when did I decide to pick it up?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> The bigger question is, what are you gonna eat with that spoon? You didn't get any food.</p>", "5278": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness, and I realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. Now, I recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you Googling what it means, so I'll wait.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I understand it, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, me, too.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm sorry, I spaced. Are we still talking about the spoon?</p>", "5279": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, we've never collaborated professionally before. Are you worried it might affect our relationship?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That is a valid point. Perhaps we should establish some ground rules.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, that would make me feel better.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, let's start right now. Uh, rule number one, no using sexuality to get your way.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's a ridiculous rule.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is it? (Sheldon flaunts his posterior as he walks away)</p>", "5280": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong>  Okay, how is that?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> I can actually feel the toxins being pulled out of my skin.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, this is a moisturizing mask.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, well, then I can actually feel the moisture going into my skin.</br></p>", "5281": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Number two: when we publish, my name goes first. Oh, subsequently, if we win any awards, I speak first. I don't want to be talking when the orchestra plays us off.</p>", "5282": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong>  I mean, they didn't say anything, but I just kind of felt like I was being a weird third wheel.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Huh, so you can tell what that feels like. Interesting.</p>", "5283": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, shall we get to work?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Biology and physics coming together. This is like the peanut butter cup of the mind. Ooh, I know what I want my treat to be.</p>", "5284": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I mean, I'm glad they're getting along, but it's starting to make me uncomfortable.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, are you worried he's like another man in her life?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> A little, until I saw them in matching tops.</p>", "5285": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can you stop breathing so loud? I can hear your nose whistling.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I can hear your face talking, so we're even.</p>", "5286": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, it's nice to spend time with people who don't talk about work like it's some kind of soap opera.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Jennifer still trying to sleep her way to the top?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (deflated) Yeah.</p>", "5287": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You should be happy someone wants to do the stuff with Penny you don't want to.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, I wish I had that with Howard.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wait. What? What do I make you do?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Let's see: the magic store, the Doctor Who convention, the National Belt Buckle Collector's meet and greet.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It said right there on the invitation, \"Buckle up for fun.\" It's not my fault you didn't listen.</p>", "5288": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can you read them back?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> \"Revised ground rule number one: We are on the same team, but it is a competition.\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excellent. Excellent. And on a related point, you're going down, punk.</p>", "5289": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> \"Number three: Fair topics for insult include educational pedigree, scientific field, intellectual prowess, and mamas.\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, that list is strong. Like your mother's urge to be promiscuous with sailors.</p>", "5290": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Hello, Sheldon. What a pleasant surprise. How are you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Honestly, I've been better. Do you have time? Leonard says you're very busy these days.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oh, I just say that because he prattles.</p>", "5291": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> What's going on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, our friend Raj moved into my old room, and it's brought up a lot of negative feelings for me.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Mm. Well, what do you think the loss of your room represents?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Beverly, you know I hold you in high esteem. Can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer, and get to the part where you tell me the answer?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Very well, but, uh, if you don't mind, I'd still like to pause for effect.</p>", "5292": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Maybe moving in was a bad idea. I haven't been here one day, I'm already causing problems.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You didn't do anything. It's Sheldon.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> \"You didn't do anything.It's Sheldon.\" That'd make a nice needlepoint pillow.</p>", "5293": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, just because we took our friend in does not mean that Penny and I are afraid to be alone.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, this is a special circumstance.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Sheldon mentioned you tried to get your brother to live with you, as well.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, well, a circumstance can happen twice and still be special.</p>", "5294": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Do you agree with that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, now that you point it out-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you kidding me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We do seem to keep finding roommates.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Now you're taking her side?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Dear, I would never come between you and Leonard. That's for your parade of roommates to do.</p>", "5295": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Can I just stay in the garage?<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Don't do that. We'll make up the couch for you and figure out something in the morning.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Come on, I'll get you some sheets. Then I'll see if I can beat my high score on the blood pressure machine.</br></p>", "5296": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Never should've had all these kids so close together.</p>", "5297": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I didn't think this is where my life would be.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Me, either. I'm in a bedroom and you're on a couch. I'm actually winning.</p>", "5298": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, no offense, but I didn't go to art school. I have a PhD in astrophysics.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, great, it'll be easier for you to look up at the stars without a roof over your head.</p>", "5299": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did you know Raj moved out last night?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What? Why?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> \"Leonard and Penny, I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused. I went to stay at Howard's. P.S. Cinnamon's with me, but if you feel like messing with Sheldon, tell him she's loose in the building.\"</p>", "5300": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Should we go bring him back?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, you're the one worried having someone live with us is a sign of problems.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, that was just because my mother got in my head. It's like being possessed, but instead of Satan, it's -- Actually, it's the same thing.</p>", "5301": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You are not a burden, and we want you to come back and stay with us.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> But I also upset Sheldon, and he's not gonna want to come over if I'm there.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> More reasons for you to stay.</p>", "5302": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> (coming into the living room) Halley's fine.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You know she's at my parents' house, right?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> And she's having the time of her life.</p>", "5303": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. He can't afford his apartment, and he's asking if anyone knows of a cheap place to live. I want to say \"India,\" but it seems mean.</p>", "5304": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine, what should we do?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We're smart. I'm sure we can think of something.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You want to let him live here?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, we're smarter than that.</p>", "5305": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, uh, so we've been talking, and if you need a place to stay, we'd be happy to fix up the garage for you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That would be amazing! I was literally just looking at my moving boxes, trying to pick one to live in.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I know it's not ideal, but you'd have plenty of space for your furniture, and there's this cool button that makes an entire wall go up and down.</p>", "5306": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Speaking of occupants, I'm given to understand Raj will be moving into my old room.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, for a little while.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What about his dog?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> She'll be in her crate; it's not a big deal.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I suppose that's acceptable.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, Sheldon's getting a little better with dogs. He even took a picture with Pluto at Disneyland.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If real dogs gave me buttons, I'd like them, too.</p>", "5307": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you're implying that I'd have some problem with him moving into my room, you're wrong. Raj is in a difficult financial situation, and I'm glad that he's making changes to improve it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (To Amy) Do not adjust the dosage. You nailed it.</p>", "5308": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Can I get anyone anything at all?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Raj, you don't have to serve us.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's the least I can do for helping me carry my stuff up.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It was really no problem.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Not for you, box of towels.</p>", "5309": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you, Sheldon. It's a blank notebook.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I had some of my best ideas in that room, and I'm sure you will, too.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> He also never had sex in that room. That's something else to look forward to.</p>", "5310": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Why don't you just tell him you don't want to go?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> I can't, it'll break his heart. You know, he's always making an effort to do things with me he doesn't enjoy, like going outside.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> He is an indoor cat.</br></p>", "5311": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We're helping Raj figure out his finances.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, he has a job. How bad can it be?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, his rent and car lease are exceedingly high. You couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, wait. Not shopping for clothes, right? Because look. (points to Raj)</p>", "5312": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe you should find someone to help you get your finances under control.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Like a business manager?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, absolutely not. You can't afford to hire someone who'll forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses. That is a foolish expense, and I forbid it.</p>", "5313": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What if there's someone who just likes controlling other people and stealing joy from their lives?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He sounds like a sociopath.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We don't know, his mother never had him tested.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're talking about me. Very funny. Although I would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing Raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion.</p>", "5314": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, let me guess. You guys are drafting your fantasy accounting firms.</p>", "5315": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, Sheldon. Yeah, I'm putting you in charge of my finances. I will not spend another penny that you don't authorize.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Very well. Hey, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday. You can't buy one.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, better luck next time, Pink Cheeks.</p>", "5316": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You actually think Penny will have fun at Comic-Con?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. Which will make me miserable, which is usually Sheldon's job.</p>", "5317": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She's gonna hate waiting in line for the panels.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She's gonna hate all the crowds at the panels.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She's gonna hate the panels.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She's gonna hate how often we say the word \"panels.\"</p>", "5318": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Come on, Sheldon, it's Comic-Con. Just let me have the money for this, and I won't ask for anything else.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You put me in charge of your finances. If you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over, you should have asked Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> See? Miserable.</p>", "5319": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, you're right, I got myself into this, but I've never missed a Comic-Con with you guys.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Your father may have spoiled you, but I won't. If you want a ticket to Comic-Con, I suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, you're a grown man who's highly educated. You could charge people money to punch you.</p>", "5320": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Mm, how's my favorite girl?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What you doing?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Making lasagna.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, she's sexy, she can cook. I'm such a lucky guy.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You want something stupid, or you did something stupid?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No. I just walked in here, saw how beautiful you are and had to tell you.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, dear God, you're cheating on me with Raj.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (false giggle) Never gets old.</p>", "5321": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's so hard to say no to you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So I'll say maybe.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What? Why?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You said tickets don't go on sale till Friday, right?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You said you were gonna do all this stuff for me, right?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (losing enthusiasm) Yeah.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> See where I'm going with this?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (dejected) Yeah.</p>", "5322": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Okay, I can give you 20 bucks for the whole box.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> But you charged me hundreds for this stuff. I know.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> And I did it with a straight face.</p>", "5323": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'll give you 25 bucks. That's my best offer.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I have no choice.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> You know, if you want to make extra money, I could throw some work your way.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really? I'll do anything.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Great, you're hired. First thing you can do is put price tags on these. Start the little ones at $50.</p>", "5324": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What do you want?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm looking to make extra money and was wondering if you had any chores I could do.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hang on. Bernie, can I outsource my chores to an Indian guy?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I tried.</p>", "5325": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, I was thinking, if you want to do a couples costume, we could paint ourselves green and be Hulk and She-Hulk. Or we could paint ourselves blue and go as Nightcrawler and Mystique.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Is there any scenario where we're not in full body paint?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, if you want us to look like losers.</br></p>", "5326": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> He's such a sweetie.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I know, I wish there was some way we could help him.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> If he could find a girl with a good job, all his problems would be over.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (scrubbing the inside of the oven) Yeah, that's working out great for me.</p>", "5327": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> This is for you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What's this?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's back pay for all the babysitting and taking care of Halley you've done.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> There's more than enough in there to cover Comic-Con.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Um, I also take care of Halley.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> And you live here for free.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I do, ma'am, thank you, ma'am.</p>", "5328": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You know what, I'm not gonna go either. I'm a father now. I'd rather spend time with my family.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You just don't want to go alone with Sheldon.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (rushing out of the room) I'm gonna go check on dinner.</p>", "5329": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What is happening?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> This is an Euler's Disk. It's a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum, potential energy, and kinetic energy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aw, look at you watching sports.</p>", "5330": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, listen, I just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill, it might be a little high this month.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Well, you're a grown man with a steady job. Why wouldn't you spend all your father's money?</p>", "5331": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you think that's more fun than talking to Zachary Quinto through a stall door, you're crazy.</p>", "5332": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, we could've come to you guys. You didn't have to bring the baby here.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, it's okay. It's good to get out of the house.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And the car ride puts her to sleep.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aw, that used to work with Sheldon.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot and he freaked out.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Who forgot to crack the window?</p>", "5333": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, someone's been shopping at Gucci.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, I saw something for Halley and I couldn't resist.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's so sweet of you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, it's a crushed velvet baby cape.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, no, now we have two.</p>", "5334": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> That must've been expensive.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, it was. But it's my father's money and I'm mad at him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's going on with your dad?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And if you really want to hurt him, I look great in Chanel.</p>", "5335": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> MSN Search, AltaVista, and Ask Jeeves. You?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sorry, I don't have a list of defunct search engines that I miss.</p>", "5336": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Hey. Looks like I got stood up, so I'm gonna head out.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, no. Are you sure you don't want to give her a few more minutes?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Nah, G-Harmony recommends after two hours, it's time to cut bait.</p>", "5337": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, that was so sweet of you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So the part where he got stood up didn't clue you in?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You want me to look at him and listen to him?</p>", "5338": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> My father thinks the reason I can't make a relationship work is because I'm spoiled.<br/>\n(Everybody is quiet, looking sheepishly away from Raj)<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sorry, is he waiting for someone to disagree?</p>", "5339": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Good question. Let's see. Infoseek, WebCrawler, oh, HotBot.</p>", "5340": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You don't need your dad's money. You can get by on your salary.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. Well, we work at the same place as you, and we've always been fine.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, please. Look in the mirror. You both look ten years older than I do.</br></p>", "5341": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you. Why not Raj, too?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What-what are you doing? I-I-I schlepped the baby over, I brought imported beer. Why don't you like me?</p>", "5342": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> You're an adult who can't get by without an allowance from his parents. Women don't want that.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What are you saying, that you're giving up on me? What kind of father gives up on his son?<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> I have six children, five of whom are married and self-sufficient. I don't think I'm the problem.</p>", "5343": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I thought we were best friends!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We are! That's why I'm sad my best friend's gonna be homeless.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm sorry, Raj. We really just don't have the space.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What if he lives in your garage?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What if you stop helping?!</p>", "5344": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This circle contains only me and you. It represents subjects we only share with each other. Details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits. Although, as I'm saying it, I may need to add Dr. Fink in here.</p>", "5345": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Two years ago I got my driver's license.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What? Why didn't you say anything?!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I like being chauffeured around. It makes me feel important.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So when I got up at 4:00 AM to drive you across the desert to an antique train museum, I didn't have to?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, you didn't. But keep in mind, I felt extremely important.</p>", "5346": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Oh, no, my grown son is going to stop spending all my money. Where did I fail as a father?! <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, that's right. Keep asking yourself that! But I still love you very much, so don't cut me out of the will.</p>", "5347": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, wait. This is our first fight as a couple who live together.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not sure of the protocol. Television teaches us that the man's supposed to sleep on the couch, but of the two of us, you're clearly more sofa-sized.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm not sleeping on the couch 'cause you don't know what's private and what's not.</p>", "5348": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, I'm zeroing out the electro-osmotic flow rate in the micro-fluidic channel.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Nicely done, Howard.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied, so clearly I know my way around tiny things.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Those are just the things I say out loud.</p>", "5349": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What's wrong?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am looking at the math, and I think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's great, but the Air Force approved the specs. We're good to go.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, it doesn't need to be smaller.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Shame on you. Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude? I'll tell you. We would have the standard and the miniature poodle, but no toy or teacup. Which by the way, is not an officially recognized breed, but that's just poodle politics.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can we please stop talking about poodles?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. Candy bars. Now, do you enjoy a fun size? I know you do.</p>", "5350": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom. As long as that's not a urinary tract infection, that's a personal best.</p>", "5351": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> For Howie's occupation, should I include that he was an astronaut?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, he mentioned it in his mother's eulogy, so why not?</p>", "5352": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You'll never believe it. Leonard gave me the most incredible gift, a trip to a historic railway, and I get to operate an actual locomotive.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Wow. He finally used it. What'd you do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No idea. All I know is, I'm going to be working on the railroad all the live long day.</p>", "5353": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I'm really happy for you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no. It's not just me. No, the railway is four hours from the nearest airport, and guess who gets to drive me.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I give up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No. I really give up.</p>", "5354": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> This train thing worked out better than I thought. He's home studying the engineer's manual.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's so peaceful without him here. Can I ask you how much that cost?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> $4,000. Worth every penny.</p>", "5355": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, you ladies have fun tonight.<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> Don't worry about Halley. Uncle Stuart's on the job.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Under the careful supervision of her godfather.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> My apologies. I didn't mean to offend you, Don Corleone.</br></p>", "5356": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Okay, instead of arguing all night, let's just split up the baby chores.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, great. Um, I'll put food in her top half, you deal with whatever comes out the bottom.</p>", "5357": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> (electrical crackling) What is that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know, but if he yells, \"It's alive,\" we run.</p>", "5358": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller, and we can't do it without you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Interesting. So I was right.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Open a window. It's about to get smug in here.</p>", "5359": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Did you hear anything back from the Caltech preschool?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Not yet, but we're gonna apply to a bunch of others just to keep our options open.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, stop that! No more preschool talk. Tonight is about having fun.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Nothing says fun like being scolded.</p>", "5360": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> So we just throw this away?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What else are you gonna do with it? Put it in your coffee?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, I don't take it black.</p>", "5361": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sorry, guys. This club was so great. How could they turn it into a bookstore? I thought we got rid of all those.</p>", "5362": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Little parenting tip: sleeping babies hate flash photography.</p>", "5363": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Is everything okay?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah. I may have just left my infant daughter with Patrick and SpongeBob.</p>", "5364": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're upset I had a baby?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, of course not. I just I didn't think it would make me have all these feelings.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What feelings?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Pressure! I mean, she's looking at preschools, she has a minivan, she has a 401(k). Before she talked about it, I just thought that was a race.</p>", "5365": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aren't you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, thanks. I'm busy trying to fix this fuel pump.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's a manifold.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Well, I guess it's fixed.</p>", "5366": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just look at the board.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's wrong.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, no! What should we have done differently?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, first of all, you can't use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Told ya. (scoffs) Can you fix it for us?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (sighs) Okay, but this is the last time. (Draws Charlie Brown's face on the squiggle Leonard drew on the board) Nice try, blockheads.</p>", "5367": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, what do you say?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, what choice do I have? You need me. (pointing to the engine) I'm like the crankshaft of this team.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's a turbo.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy. I'm gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home.</p>", "5368": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Stuart, don't you drink my milk!</p>", "5369": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, in the world of theoretical physics, you never finish; so much is unprovable.<br/>\nBut when I was studying that railway guide, it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked. Then it clacked. Then it clicked, then it clacked, click-clack clickety-clack, and here we are. Whoo-whoo!</p>", "5370": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Is there anything we can do?<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sure. Open up a college fund, shop for life insurance, and in the laundry room, there's a mountain of dirty laundry. Wash it or burn in, your choice.</br></p>", "5371": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What are the reasons women reject Raj?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Can we not play this game?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Doesn't like games. That's one.</p>", "5372": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're not being very nice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What? He said he was fine.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sometimes people say things they don't mean.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that's a paradox. If you meant what you just said, then that means you may not have meant what you just said.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Careful, I saw this on Star Trek. Smoke's gonna come out of his ears soon.</p>", "5373": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, boys. How's it going?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I thought we were having a nice conversation, but it turns out, I was being offensive.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So, normal.</p>", "5374": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You have no idea what it's like to struggle with recognizing emotional cues.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm sure it's extremely frustrating.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And also a little sad.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, now you're just showing off.</p>", "5375": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's supposed to be accurate, like, 85% of the time.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, I find that hard to believe.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That a bunch of awkward scientists with no social skills would invent a machine to do it for them?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I take it back. I believe it.</p>", "5376": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A machine that reads emotions is intriguing. It could help me be a more considerate friend.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Wouldn't that be nice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It could also help me identify my enemies, discover their fears and then I could use those fears to destroy them.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I like the first one.</p>", "5377": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Now that Sheldon's across the hall, have you decided what you're doing with his old room?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You could make it a train room.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't like trains. You like trains.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know, and Amy says I can't have a train room.</p>", "5378": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Now, I'm gonna look at some pictures to prompt an emotional response, and we'll see if the machine can identify them accurately.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, remember, it can only detect happy, sad, angry and excited. Not other things you're feeling, like, \"What have I done with my life?\"</p>", "5379": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What does it say I'm feeling?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sad.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes. I'm looking at a picture of my grandma.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that makes sense, 'cause she's gone and you miss her.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And you're worried that turkey neck is in your future. What, now, see, now it says you're mad. Make up your mind.</p>", "5380": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Is that Emily your ex-girlfriend?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah. I'm getting all my exes together in order to discuss why they broke up with me and how I can be a better boyfriend.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, God. You went through with that? What is wrong with you?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> We are going to find out.</p>", "5381": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're not gonna get information, you're just gonna get criticism that hurts your feelings.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Don't worry, I'm a grown man. I have a thick skin.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (chuckles) You're so stupid.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey!</p>", "5382": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, Leonard, if you're happy and you know it, no need to clap your hands, because I have an emotion detector.</p>", "5383": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What's that? Are you working on your resume?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, it's my brother's. I'm trying to help him get a job out here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, ooh! And that makes Leonard angry.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, it doesn't.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What? Leonard, please. I know an angry face when I see it. It's this red frowny guy on my phone.</p>", "5384": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't see the big deal if my brother comes and stays for a while.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If you get him a job, he's gonna live here forever!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> He would get his own place.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Has he ever had his own place?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did it have a metal toilet next to the bed?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It still counts.</p>", "5385": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Come on, Sheldon, let's go.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Gladly. Can we storm out?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I think it loses its impact if we're chatting about it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. I'll just give them the finger. (Sheldon gives them a thumbs down)</br></p>", "5386": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, heads up, both of you are named Emily, so we'll call you \"red-headed Emily\" and you, \"red-headed Emily, Junior.\"</p>", "5387": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, uh, let's get things started. Um, why don't we go around the room, say your name, and why you broke up with me. Want to kick it off?<br/><strong>Lucy:</strong> Oh, okay. Um, I'm Lucy, and I broke up with Raj because I have severe social anxiety, and he kept trying to force me into uncomfortable situations.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Like this one?<br/><strong>Lucy:</strong> Yeah.</p>", "5388": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I did do that. I can be insensitive to other people's boundaries. Howard, would you write that down?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> \"Schmuck.\" Got it.</p>", "5389": "<p><strong>Claire:</strong> Um I'm Claire. And I guess I broke up with you because you were just really needy. Also, you were incredibly vain. Like, all the time you spent shaping your eyebrows-<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, new rule. Everybody only gets one.</p>", "5390": "<p><strong>Emily:</strong> Ooh, I'm not sure I'm comfortable sharing details about our relationship in front of Howard.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh. He's here to support me, so anything you have to say you can say in front of him.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Okay. Well, whenever you and I were in bed-<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Howard, get out.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Not a chance.</p>", "5391": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I thought I was getting better at it, but clearly I'm not.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes, you are. There have definitely been days when I was sad and you could tell.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, but that's shooting fish in a barrel. You're kind of a sad sack. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. I'm just upset.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, see, right there, you knew you hurt my feelings. And I'm proud of you - for reasons I'm sure have something to do with my father.</p>", "5392": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> (Interpreting for Emily #1) \"I thought you were great, but, oh, my God, you were so dominated by your parents.\" <br/><strong>Emily #2:</strong> Oh, yeah, and that used to drive me nuts. He's kind of a mama's boy.<br/><strong>Claire:</strong> Kind of?!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Whoa, okay! That's enough. (To Howard) Write down \"loving son.\"</p>", "5393": "<p><strong>Emily:</strong> You know, the same thing happened to me. After I broke up with Raj, I met Gary, who's just amazing.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sorry, is that \"Gary\" with one R or two?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Would you stop writing?!</p>", "5394": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, maybe we should just end this.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wait, hang on. I just want to point out to everyone here, this is a man who is going to great lengths to better himself. Even at the risk of being humiliated. And I, for one, think that's very brave.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you, Howard.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Honestly, I'm surprised you two didn't wind up together.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, like you gals, I had to suffer through him to find Bernadette.</p>", "5395": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We owe you an apology.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, it's fine. You needed a suitcase, I wasn't home, you borrowed a suitcase.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That was six years ago. I'm talking about tonight.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, well, I thought we were going in order.</p>", "5396": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, we got really angry at each other, and you just got caught in the middle of it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And sorry about the suitcase.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, well, you should be. Your socks were still in it. I had to throw it away.</p>", "5397": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'll make you a deal. Thirty years from now, if you're still single and things don't work out with me and Bernadette you and I can give it a go.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I appreciate the offer, but if things don't work out with you two, I'm swooping in on her like a vulture.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Too late. Stuart called dibs.</p>", "5398": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, I just read a study that suggests new mothers are better at sensing emotions for up to two years.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's true. Pregnancy causes physiological changes in the brain that result in increased empathy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Huh. So all we need to do is get Sheldon knocked up.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We can't. He was already fixed when I found him at the shelter.</p>", "5399": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's going on with that woman you're dating?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I broke up with her.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> She said she didn't want to see me any more and I found that insulting.</p>", "5400": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Maybe I'll just play the field.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, the field was just here. The field said no.</br></p>", "5401": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you gonna laugh at the answer?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Only if the answer is \"shopping for baby shoes.\"</p>", "5402": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's okay, Howie never has on pants. The Domino's guy brings the pizza like this now. (covering her eyes)<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, Sheldon always has his pants on. I don't think I could pick his knees out of a lineup.</p>", "5403": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy is free. She had a harp lesson on Saturday, but it got canceled. Boy, when you take an interest in people, you really uncork a geyser of nonsense.</p>", "5404": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> No offense to her father, but he's not an MIT-trained engineer. Thinking and building is what you do.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> MIT's motto is \"Mind and Hand,\" which just so happens was also my motto as a lonely teenager.</p>", "5405": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'll call you when we get to the hotel.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I will bring them home so you can show me how Godzilla takes a shower.</p>", "5406": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're sad, so I made you tea.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thanks.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And it's just the way you like it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Earl Grey?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Honey?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Unsweetened almond-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good Lord! I made you tea. Just drink it!</p>", "5407": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't want to play a game, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wow, and I remember when you loved playing games with me. Maybe Penny isn't the only relationship you're phoning in.</p>", "5408": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not that I'd stopped trying, it's just how relationships progress. They start with infatuation, but over time mellow into something more comfortable.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm. Yeah, you're right. It's like when I first encountered the Pythagorean Theorem. You know, I was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides. Yeah, but now I'm just like \"eh.\"</p>", "5409": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It's nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughter's going to as well.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Mm. I hope she has the same amount of sex in it I did. None.</p>", "5410": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> When was the last time you got a massage?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago, but that was just 'cause there was a spider on his pillow and he was trying to get away.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard stood on me once, too, but he was just trying to see the Rose Parade.</p>", "5411": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, Amy. It's nice to see you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Nice to see you, too.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (to Leonard) And that's how you make effort look effortless.</p>", "5412": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, why don't we give them some privacy?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Very well. Hey, later, we'll check out the minibar. I'll show you how Godzilla gets drunk.</p>", "5413": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's a cucumber in my water.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Uh-huh.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do they know it's there? Um, sh-should I tell somebody?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's there on purpose. It's refreshing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Interesting. The world's most boring liquid and the world's most boring vegetable. But you put 'em together, and bleh.</p>", "5414": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Listen, we realized, that, uh we're facing some new challenges as a married couple.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. And there are a few things we need to stay on top of. So we thought it would useful, and I can't believe I am about to say this-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Would you please help us make a Relationship Agreement? But one that's tailored to us. Okay? We don't need a bathroom schedule.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance.</p>", "5415": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> \"Article 8, subsection B: Leonard will restrict video-gaming in underpants to hours Penny is not home.<br>\nThis includes boxers, briefs, thongs, G-strings or anything else that calls attention to his pasty little thighs.\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Does it really need to say that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I did this for free, let me get a little something.</br></p>", "5416": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> \"Article 10, subsection C: If questioned, Penny may not say that everything is fine if it isn't.<br/>\nOther unacceptable responses include: 'It's nothing', 'Don't worry about it', and 'I said it's nothing, don't worry about it'.\"</p>", "5417": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You sign here, date here. And, Penny, if you could initial here to indicate that you're accepting Leonard in \"as is\" condition.</p>", "5418": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Stupid idea.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, what's stupid is a physicist who doesn't understand when you swing an axe, you don't let go.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> For the tenth time, my mittens were slippery!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ugh. It's 70 degrees, you didn't need mittens.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know how easily I blister.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes, yes, you bruise, you peel. It's like I'm married to an old piece of fruit.</p>", "5419": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So Bernadette, if I express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, how's life with your baby?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really? You're never gonna touch their baby?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> To this day I've never touched Stuart.</p>", "5420": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How come Stuart can get her to stop crying, but I can't?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's Stuart. Maybe she's playing possum until he goes away.</p>", "5421": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How did you get the baby to stop crying?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, I just talked to her. I've been told the sound of my voice puts people to sleep.</p>", "5422": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, there's a chance she might be okay with it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Eh, I don't know. I am her precious little boy. And you did take my flower.</p>", "5423": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, while we're at your mother's house, it might be a good time to tell her that we're living together.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do we have to? I really don't want to hear the religious lecture.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Maybe there won't be one.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's always one. She gave it to my sister about her boyfriend, my brother about his girlfriend, my father about his girlfriend. That one had some un-Christian words in it.</p>", "5424": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Well, thank you for letting me know, and I, for one, am thrilled.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What? What Where's the judgment? Where's the fire and brimstone? Where's the part where you tell us we're going to Hell, and I say \"Have you seen the size of the bugs outside? We're already there!\"</p>", "5425": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, what what are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just being the un-socialized eccentric my mother always thought I was.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> You startin' to see why I didn't go in there?</p>", "5426": "<p>[In Mary Cooper's living room]<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And I don't understand why you're taking her side. By being my girlfriend, she's saying you're a weirdo, too.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't think that's what she's saying.<br/>\n[Cut to Sheldon and Amy in the apartment kitchen, telling Leonard and Penny the story of their trip]<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's exactly what she was saying.</p>", "5427": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can you believe my mother thinks we're both strange?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (loudly) Absolutely not!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (whispering) That's too loud.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (quietly) Absolutely not.</p>", "5428": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, I'm sorry your mother made you feel bad. But, you know, at the end of the day, she was wrong, because you're not alone.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're right. I have Leonard and Howard and Raj, Stuart, Penny, Leonard's mom, Bernadette, Wil Wheaton.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was going chronologically. You're right between Koothrappali's father and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy.</p>", "5429": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> This was a potential issue, so I got out ahead of it and I managed the situation for you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You \"managed the situation\"?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's right.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks I'm incapable of running my own life.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Not your whole life! I mean, science. You got that. Organizing your sock drawer, you're the king.</p>", "5430": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> There's the little family!<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And their Sherpas.</br></p>", "5431": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> They told Mary they were living together, there was a fight, he got his feelings hurt, then he put underwear on his head-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> On purpose, not the way it used to happen in high school.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was acting odd intentionally.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Really? So you can control it?</p>", "5432": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, man. This is really happening. You doin' okay?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Here comes another contraction.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Let's pick it up!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> All right, hold on. I'm gonna drive like we do in India. (honking the horn) Get out of my way, you syphilitic dogs!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Stop that! This isn't India.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Fine. What do one point three billion people know about having babies?</p>", "5433": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sorry, I know you were just trying to help. (To Bernadette) I love you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I love you, too. We're good.</p>", "5434": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You hate Scotch tape, but you love Scotch plaid. You are a mystery.</p>", "5435": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm sorry.It's our first time. <br/><strong>Althea:</strong> It's okay. This little one will be here before you know it. Do we know what we're having?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, we're keeping it a surprise.<br/><strong>Althea:</strong> Old school. Nice.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Not that old school. He knows.</p>", "5436": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, what took you so long?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wolowitz might hand out cigars. I had to find my bubble gum cigar so I could join in without looking foolish.</p>", "5437": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Babe, they want to have sex.<br/>\nPennny: Oh, of course! The annual birthday booty spectacular!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's a bit childish, isn't it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm sorry, and what flavor is your bubble gum cigar?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Grape. I find it the most mild.</p>", "5438": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> (filming a video for the baby) Okay, little one, here we are back at home because you weren't quite ready to come out yet. You wanted to make an entrance. I get it.</p>", "5439": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> And here's your daddy. When he tries to tell you he used to be cool, you can see he wasn't.</p>", "5440": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, enough with the camera.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, this is not for me. This is for the baby. Some day she's gonna want to see this.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm sorry. Who's gonna want to see this?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I I said \"she\" but lots of things are she - boats and cars, whales. Like, \"thar she blows!\"<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> You're doing great.</p>", "5441": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I mean, the mood's a little different now. We don't have to rush.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I know, but Leonard and Penny think we're doing it, and I don't want to disappoint them.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And the mood continues to change.</p>", "5442": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I think I might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Intriguing. Is \"back on track\" a hint that it has something to do with trains?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because if it did have to do with trains, and you were gonna give-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's not about trains!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Stop talking about trains!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who's killing the mood now?</p>", "5443": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (groaning) Here comes another one. (yelling) Hey, Squinty, the gas pedal's on the right!<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> All right, hang on. If you see any pedestrians, just call 'em out.</p>", "5444": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> This is not how I imagined this day going. I should be with them right now.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, it is their child.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I know that. But to be fair, I've spent nine months helping Bernadette get ready for this baby. And Howard spent five minutes conceiving it. And I'm being generous.</p>", "5445": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Five minutes? We must be doing it wrong. It took us hours.</p>", "5446": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (To Howard) I'm so thirsty. Give me more ice chips.<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> (munching on ice chips) Sorry. I thought these were room ice chips.</br></p>", "5447": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I didn't know her five minutes and she asked, (imitating Mrs. Wolowitz) \"Are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?\"<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thank God you answered right - we wouldn't be here today.</p>", "5448": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's hard to believe Howard's having a kid.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Penny, you're the one who introduced him to Bernie.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?</p>", "5449": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> For God's sake, just drive in the knife, why don't you!<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> What's your problem?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, you're all thinking that I'm the only one who hasn't done anything worthwhile.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was not thinking it. Although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable.</p>", "5450": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Raj, if it's any consolation, I'm no better off than I was ten years ago.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, yay! I have a doctorate in astrophysics and I'm every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Raj! Show some compassion. Those are things that we think but don't say.</p>", "5451": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Remember what you learned in birthing class.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I remember thinking, \"this is stupid\" and I was right!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Do you want me to get the nurse?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No! If one more person puts their fingers near my uterus, I'm gonna cross my legs and snap 'em off!</p>", "5452": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, that was quite a day.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It was. Bernadette had her baby, I made it to Wizarding World, and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration. (Pointing his wand) Hankius pankius.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I was afraid you'd be too tired.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, I just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line. If that's not foreplay, I don't know what is.</p>", "5453": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Come along, Amy. I know when I'm not wanted.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't think you do, but alright.</p>", "5454": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're good at revenge; how do we get him back?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, my go-to move is usually sleep with the person's boyfriend, but I kind of feel like I'm already doing that.</p>", "5455": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He's expecting a newspaper in the morning. Apparently, they still make them.</p>", "5456": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, I tried.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> \"All right, I tried.\" That should be the title of your autobiography. Ooh, a second-degree burn.</p>", "5457": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> If we're going to be staying in this apartment, would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, actually, I would.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Great, what'd you have in mind?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let's take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here.</p>", "5458": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, how about we start a little smaller? Like moving the furniture around.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building.</p>", "5459": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, guys, what are you? Oh, that's here, cool.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Amy wants me to have it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, it would be selfish of me to keep it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> But it's a picture of you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> But you commissioned it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> To give to you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> But you like it so much.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So do you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I seem to be losing.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, you do.</p>", "5460": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, Leonard, the more I think about it, there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and I should go through. Uh, for example who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Why don't you keep it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That seems fair. We did just give you the painting.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I don't need anything around that I can stab myself with.</br></p>", "5461": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wonderful, Longclaw is mine. And how about you keep our ... avocado plant?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sounds right. A limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash.</p>", "5462": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Although, Amy and I did just move in together, and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fine, take the plant.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, we got a sword and a plant. Our apartment's really shaping up.</p>", "5463": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Stuart, you didn't have to get us a baby gift.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, just homemade coupons for things you might need help with before the baby gets here. Going to the grocery store, driving you to the doctor. If you're not in a hurry, I can dig you a koi pond.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> A foot massage?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> And that's not me being creepy, that's for either of you.</p>", "5464": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Uh, now that you mention it can I live here?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Stuart, we'd love to help you out, but this a bad time; we're about to have a baby.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Or is that why this is a great time? Think about it. When that baby comes, you're gonna need all the help you can get.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Thank you, but I'm not really sure.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hang on, maybe it's not the worst idea. I mean, he did do a good job taking care of my mother.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> That woman didn't get heat rash once with me on powder patrol.</p>", "5465": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, I guess you could stay for a few days and we'll see how it goes.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Thank you. And it's only temporary, just till I get back on my feet. Or the baby goes off to college, whichever happens first.</p>", "5466": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> But I am ready to be helpful. In fact, I'm gonna go vacuum.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Actually, I just did that this morning.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Okay, then I'll dust.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I did that, too.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Then I'll check the batteries in the smoke detectors.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howard just did that.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, let him do it.</p>", "5467": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh! Remember when we got this at Comic-Con?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, yeah. The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock.<br/><strong>Clock:</strong> Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's one of a kind.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So if it breaks there'd be none of it?</p>", "5468": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Stuart, you cooked?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> How did you know it wasn't me?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> There's only three people in this house, and you'd still be my fifth guess.</p>", "5469": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hey, Raj.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, I'm living here again.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Do, uh, Howard and Bernadette know? Or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?</p>", "5470": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, I know what you did, now change the password back.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, powder me in sugar and call me a donut, if it isn't Leonard Hofstadter.</p>", "5471": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Thank you again for cooking. It's getting tough for me to be on my feet all day.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> You just kick back and relax; I've got it all under control.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Although it was already under control.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'm sorry, you mumbled something?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's just that they've had plenty of help.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, you know what they say. It takes a village.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, they already had a village.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I noticed the village couldn't find time to put the crib together.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy checking out the local Montessori school for the new arrival.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> You mean the one with the empty beer bottles in the sandbox? We'll pass, thank you.</p>", "5472": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hey, what's up?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm here to put the crib together.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Ooh, sorry, I already did it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, I don't know if you realize this, but I bought that crib.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, yeah, I read about that on WhoGivesACrap.com<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why are you being like this?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Because I love Howard and Bernadette and if I want to keep mooching off them, I need to be helpful.</p>", "5473": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, what do you think you're doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever I please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night.<br/><strong>Theodore:</strong> It's like the '40s again.</p>", "5474": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, hey, Bernadette, the swing comes with two different mobiles. The giraffes are pretty cute, what do you think?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Great, go with the giraffes.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Although the high contrast of zebra stripes might provide better stimulus for a developing baby.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, you're probably right, go with the zebras.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Good choice, boss.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> At least my nose is naturally brown.</p>", "5475": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What do you think? Should we go to a hotel?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> And just leave him here alone?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, I'll go to a hotel. Text me in the morning if you're still alive.</br></p>", "5476": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I'd like that, too.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and I'm not just saying that because it touched your genitals.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You promise?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I do. And to show you that there are no hard feelings, I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well.</p>", "5477": "<p><strong>Theodore:</strong> Well if we're rubbing genitals on things, that's where I shine.</p>", "5478": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Little lower to the left. A little more.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is it good?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, still hideous.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I'm sure at some point, we won't even notice it's there.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, you'd think that, but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams.</p>", "5479": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (off-screen) Howard!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Guys, you heard her, go see what she wants.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (enters the room) I think I'm in labor.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, oh, okay. Okay, uh, uh, uh, I can do this. We have a plan. Somebody please tell me the plan.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'll get the hospital bag.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'll pull the van up.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Meet you outside in 2 minutes.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Team Baby, go!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I love you.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I love you, too.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Are we hugging or having a baby? Let's go!</p>", "5480": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How much money did he win?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Over half a million dollars.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wow.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And he doesn't have to use it for research, he can do whatever he wants with it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, good, maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under.</p>", "5481": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Here he comes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Right. Be polite.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know how to behave.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Do you?</p>", "5482": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, congratulations Bert!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, good for you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's amazing.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Thanks. I was as surprised as anybody. When they called and told me I won, I didn't believe them.<br/>\nAnd then they said, \"No, you really won.\" And then I said, \"Cool.\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Someone call George R. R. Martin, this guy knows how to finish a story.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> I've gotten pretty good at telling it. Well, see ya.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Some genius. I zinged him with sarcasm, he didn't even notice.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know, and it was the greatest sarcastic quip I've ever heard.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, aren't you a peach.</p>", "5483": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ignore him, he's just cranky because Bert from the geology lab won a big grant.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I heard him interviewed on the radio! You know, when they told him he won, he didn't believe it, but then he did believe it. It was so funny.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who listens to the radio any more?</p>", "5484": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie, it's in poor taste.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, it's not. Check it out. He says fun stuff.<br/><strong>Remote Control Stephen Hawking:</strong> Hey good lookin', want to go for a spin? (Howard spins the toy around)<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> His eyes also light up in the dark.</p>", "5485": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ye -- why? (turning the page) Eh, why?! (turning the page) Oh, that's why.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sounds like the night we had coitus.</p>", "5486": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I hope you're happy making me read this. Bert's work is remarkable. And I'm more upset than ever. This is worse than when I had to admit that Cedric the Entertainer's actually entertaining.</p>", "5487": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What's this button do?<br/><strong>Remote Control Stephen Hawking:</strong> Gentlemen, start your wheelchairs.<br/>\n*Raj stares disapprovingly at Howard*<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You laughed when that guy got hit in the nuts.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I laughed because the guy was Leonard.</p>", "5488": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, I do understand what you're feeling. My brother and sister's accomplishments have always been held over my head.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How did you deal with it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I wet the bed until college, but I don't think that's a quality fix.</p>", "5489": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What happened?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wha--? And what happened to you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I laughed so hard, I burst a blood vessel in my nose.</p>", "5490": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, it's one thing to be envious, but now you're injuring yourself. It has to stop.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Although if you are gonna do it again, please let me know, so I can get it on video.</br></p>", "5491": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who leaves their bike in the hallway? You know, if I knew how to ride one, I'd steal it.</p>", "5492": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, I just need to keep reminding myself that Bert's success is not my failure.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (enthusiastically) There you go.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (unenthusiastically) There you go.</p>", "5493": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't believe I was surpassed by a geologist. I mean rocks! He studies rocks! If rock is so great, how come paper beats it?</p>", "5494": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Top of the afternoon, gentlemen.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're in a good mood.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, it's a new day. I have a new outlook. You know, I realized I don't need to worry about other people. I just need to think more about myself.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, how will we ever get used to the new you?</p>", "5495": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> He doesn't just look like C-3PO, now he walks like him.</p>", "5496": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Bert? I wanted to let you know that I read your research, and your award is well-deserved.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Thanks. I've been hearing that a lot. Ever since I won, people think I'm great.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, just this once, you can count me as people, too.</p>", "5497": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> You know, as a MacArthur Grant winner, I'm allowed to nominate someone for next year.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? I didn't know that.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> So I was thinking, you know, engineers don't get a lot of respect. Is your friend Howard working on anything cool?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, I'm not sure. You know, you'd have to ask him. Excuse me.<br/>\n*Sheldon walks into the hallway and hurts himself again*</p>", "5498": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (off-screen) Leonard! I hurt myself again.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Excuse me, I have to go take some pictures.</p>", "5499": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (To Sheldon) I can't imagine you being violent.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not hard. Just picture the Three Stooges, and then take away two stooges.</p>", "5500": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm so disappointed in myself. Jealousy is completely illogical.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's a human emotion, Sheldon. Everyone gets jealous. I'm jealous of Leonard and Penny and Howard and Bernadette for being in such happy relationships.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What about me and Sheldon?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sure.</p>", "5501": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I've always been jealous of how much money Raj's family has.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you for saying that. Next to buying things, that is the best part about having money.</p>", "5502": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Bert, we need to talk.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> What happened to you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Rock, rock, water fountain.</p>", "5503": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Well, you know, we're both pretty smart. I bet if we put our heads together, we could come up with a solution.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, hang on. You're my enemy. Now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend. And right now, I'm my own worst enemy. That makes you my fr-- Okay, I'm good to go.</p>", "5504": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How can you feel bad if Stephen Hawking says you're brilliant?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't. Thank you, Professor Hawking. You are a gift to mankind. There should be statues of you everywhere. You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair. We could swap you right in.<br/><strong>Stephen Hawking:</strong> I always thought a motorized toy of me would be cool.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What a wonderful idea! How does this man not have a Nobel?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (To Amy) Do not tell Wolowitz.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Way ahead of you.</p>", "5505": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It's a gravitational wobble. It could be a sign of an extrasolar planet that may contain life and someday be named after me.<br><strong>Issabella:</strong> Oh well, if it has life, maybe it already has a name, huh?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, but it's probably difficult to pronounce.<br/><strong>Issabella:</strong> What is your name?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.<br/><strong>Issabella:</strong> You think it would be more difficult than that?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Good point.</br></p>", "5506": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, my goodness! I see quivering black lines. Those must be neurons. Oh, they're so thick and beautiful.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Those are your eyelashes. Move!</p>", "5507": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, when can we start running tests on it?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No reason we can't start right now.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What stimulus should we introduce it to first? Light, sound, temperature? Ooh! Ooh! Let's expose it to images of me and you and see who it likes better.</p>", "5508": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection of neurons. I mean, it's remarkable, but it's still limited in what it can do.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I understand. (Talking to the petri dish of brain cells) She's the mean one, I'm the fun one.</p>", "5509": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Huh, they screwed up and gave us steamed broccoli.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, no, that's mine.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? The last green thing I saw you eat was a Skittle.</p>", "5510": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look, look here I am standing next to the incubator. Uh, here is a microscopic view of the cells.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Look at that. Put them in a tiny Flash T-shirt and it's you.</p>", "5511": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images 20% faster than any other sample in Amy's lab.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm running out of ways to act excited.</p>", "5512": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> This is fun. I have never cleaned a toilet before.<br/><strong>Issabella:</strong> You're kidding.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, I grew up with a house full of servants and now I have a cleaning lady ... who is a lovely woman who I have great respect for.<br/><strong>Issabella:</strong> It's okay, you're allowed to have a cleaning lady.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, good, because she also walks my dog, buys my groceries and cuts my hair.<br/><strong>Issabella:</strong> I think that's called a mommy.</p>", "5513": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, forgive me forgive me for being nosy, but is there a wedding ring under those pretty rubber gloves? <br/><strong>Issabella:</strong> No, not for many years.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, so, you are unencumbered?<br/><strong>Issabella:</strong> Just me and my son.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I love kids, how old is he?<br/><strong>Issabella:</strong> Nineteen.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's a cute age. They can do so many things.</p>", "5514": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would you look at that? The image we gave it was 45% white noise, and it still managed to reconstruct it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I've never seen results like this before.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, we need to stop for magnets on the way home; this is going right on the fridge.</p>", "5515": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Make a baby? What are you talking about?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Clearly the combination of our DNA is exceptional. Our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind. We we'll be able to get into any preschool we want!</p>", "5516": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why does he need a baby? He's already hairless and smells like talcum powder.</p>", "5517": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, you're talking about the person I love and have been avoiding for the past three hours.</p>", "5518": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, please stop trying to seduce me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who's trying to seduce you? After a long day I always turn on smooth jazz and spray deer musk on my inner thighs.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Anything you'd like to pet? Bu-, but not my hair. There's a lot of goop in it.</p>", "5519": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What do you say? Let me make it up to you.<br/><strong>Issabella:</strong> You're very persistent.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's my one move.</p>", "5520": "<p><strong>Issabella:</strong> This Sunday night, you may take me to dinner at a nice restaurant.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Great. Where would you like to go?<br/><strong>Issabella:</strong> Your choice. It can be Pakistani food, if you like.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Excuse me, but I'm Indian.<br/><strong>Issabella:</strong> And now you know how it feels.</br></p>", "5521": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, I didn't want it to come to this. But you have left me no choice but to employ the most passionate, seductive dance known to man. The flamenco.<br/>\n*Sheldon dancing*<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> For God's sake, you're ridiculous.<br/>\n*Amy leaves the apartment*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (To Leonard and Penny) You guys are aroused, right?</p>", "5522": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I'm not ready to have a baby.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, yes, you are! I track your cycle. For the next 36 hours you're as fertile as a manure-covered wheat field.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Wow. I can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up.</p>", "5523": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> We're also coming to you live from a different apartment.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Dr. Fowler and I began an experiment in living together after her apartment became water damaged. This is our friend Penny's place. You may remember her from our episode \"Flags: And the People Who Don't Understand Them.\"</p>", "5524": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you for your services, gentlemen. I'm hoping to broaden our audience with your youthful rock and roll music.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (chuckling) Aw, you think you have an audience, that's funny.</p>", "5525": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> It's almost dinner time. You in the mood for anything?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, we could get Thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, you don't want do that, it's a construction zone.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack.</p>", "5526": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I have the feeling that she's hiding something.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I wouldn't worry about it. She's probably just distracted by work.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, whatever it is, it's troubling me. I can't eat, I can't sleep. And don't even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You heard him, guys, don't ask.</p>", "5527": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, what's the deal with your apartment? Why's it taking so long?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Um, it was a drywall problem.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, no, what happened?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, the drywall got wet, and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet, it's really more-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wet wall?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Or damp wall, just as bad.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mm. So why don't they just get more drywall?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, they went to get some, but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, are you done? Bernadette told me your apartment's ready.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I was done at \"wet wall\" but you wouldn't let it go.</p>", "5528": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, he started to question it, but then I fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower.</p>", "5529": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you going to confront Penny?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Eventually, I guess. Although, I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm. You know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far they're willing to spin their tangled webs. Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh my God, I'm going blind.</p>", "5530": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Why are you speaking Klingon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why are you speaking English?</p>", "5531": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm sorry that I lied about my apartment.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's all right.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And...<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And what? Your wizard robes are next to go.</p>", "5532": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, if he moves across the hall for good, Leonard could keep the stuff you don't like in Sheldon's old room. Solves everything.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's a great idea!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ooh, maybe I could turn it into a gaming den.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That would be amazing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, wait, hold on - excuse me, that's my room.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But you won't be living here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But that's my room.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But you won't be living here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But that's my room.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You guys might want to start eating. But you won't be living here.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is really yours.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But that's my room.<br/><strong>All:</strong> But you won't be living here!</p>", "5533": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I suppose we could find a whole new place. You know, and, technically, we don't even have to stay in Pasadena. We could, we could move to Altadena or a place that doesn't even end in \"dena.\"</p>", "5534": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> It's kind of exciting. I mean we could do whatever we want.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But what if we move and we don't like it? What if there's a smoker in the building? Or pets? Or there could be mold. There could be traffic noise.<br/>\n*Amy humming the theme from Star Trek*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm gonna have to learn a whole new bus route. Are you trying to soothe me by singing the Star Trek theme as a lullaby?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not a child, don't do that.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sorry.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you know 2001: A Space Odyssey?<br/>\n*Amy humming \"Also sprach Zarathustra*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, now that's soothing.</p>", "5535": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm kidding, I want you to feel at home here. Decorate it any way that makes you happy.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Do you really mean that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I really do.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Great, and just so you know, I'm not getting rid of all your stuff.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah? What are you keeping?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That candle and ... you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What about my robot poster?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh- I can make do with just the candle.</br></p>", "5536": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, last question. The chaps he was wearing assless?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can we just focus on the decision I'm facing?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> We can, but for the record, all chaps are assless.</p>", "5537": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Gentlemen, please, this is a significant decision. Now, do Amy and I continue living together? Or do I move back in with Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Over my assless chaps you will.</p>", "5538": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger. Put it anywhere you like.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, but you may feel some discomfort.</p>", "5539": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Really, no one else is coming?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, this is it. You are the practice round.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Practice round? For-for what?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Uh, no. He just means that you were the first people we thought of.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, exactly. We've never thrown a brunch before, and I wanted to work out all the kinks.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> So, I'm like a lab rat before your real friends come over?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You see, your words sound reasonable, but your face looks angry.</p>", "5540": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Help me out here. This is not where I shine.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Stuart, you know you're one of our favorite people.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, now, see, you look sincere, but your words are completely false. I'm glad we did this test run. These brunches are wild!</p>", "5541": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What was I thinking? Wolowitzes are not a lifting people. We tip the lifting people!</p>", "5542": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room? They're just gonna give you ice and Advil like last time.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're gonna feel terrible when I'm in a wheelchair. Which, by the way, would fit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Fine, we'll go to the E.R. Just stop selling me on the van.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're right. It sells itself.</p>", "5543": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> This is the best blintz I've ever had.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, thank you.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> It almost makes up for the incredibly awkward turn things took earlier.</p>", "5544": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> You know what, I think I'm just gonna go.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, Stuart, don't.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> No, I consider you and Sheldon like my family, and I'm not even sure you think of me as a friend. You have any idea how that feels?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> We're so sorry.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'm always the last one anybody thinks of.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, no, that's not true. I mean, sometimes it's Koothrappali. But we're not supposed to say that 'cause he's a minority.</p>", "5545": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> You know what I love about you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> You never leave the house without a paper clip!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner.</p>", "5546": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I also love how you never use swear words.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, it turns out, you can hurt people just as well without 'em.</p>", "5547": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Maybe I can get a little help putting some of this stuff away.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, calm down. I already put away five of these (Mimosas)! (To Stuart) You see? No muss, no fuss, not a single cuss.</p>", "5548": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let's say that we were to entertain people. What type of gathering did you have in mind? Huh? A meal? Lunch? Brunch? Dinner? Afternoon tea? A formal tea? Hmm? Is it a party? And if so, what kind of party? Is it a cocktail party? A Tupperware party? Ooh, yeah, is it a surprise party? Oh, I hope it's not a West Coast party, 'cause according to the man on the radio, a West Coast party don't stop.</p>", "5549": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, with us living together, maybe we could think about having people over.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We have people over all the time. We have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man, that UPS driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging.</p>", "5550": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, I mean, I know you're pregnant. I just never connected the idea of pregnancy and you actually having a baby.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Which MIT did you go to?</br></p>", "5551": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, God, we are not ready to have an infant in this house! We don't have a crib, we don't have diapers. We're not baby-proofed. Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!</p>", "5552": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong>  Howie, we have time to do all that stuff.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Do we? Look at you. Willy Wonka would roll you to the juicing room.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> The next person kicking you will be me.</p>", "5553": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You expressed an interest in having people over, and I feel I dismissed it too quickly. So, I took matters into my own hands, and I arranged a brunch.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, that's so nice. Who's coming?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, uh, Stuart, Bert from the geology lab, and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You mean the Romanian lady on the second floor?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. Oh, fun story: she grew up with ten siblings. Or possibly penguins. Her English is atrocious.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's an odd mix of people.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, for our first time hosting, I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You never went into that haunted house.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.</p>", "5554": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, thank you, Sheldon. This is a fun surprise.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, well, the real surprise is how surprised you are that I'm great at surprises.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, that's not a surprise at all. I mean, if I knew you were good at surprises, I would have expected the surprise, and therefore not have been surprised. But as it is, I didn't know, and therefore my surprise should be unsurprising.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't get me all randy. Guests are on the way.</p>", "5555": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, where you been?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, we went and did a little shopping for the baby.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wait till you see the crib we found.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You bought a crib without me?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're gonna love it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah. It's the highest rated one on the market. I wouldn't even call it a crib. I'd call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies.</p>", "5556": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You bought a minivan?!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's for the baby, and I didn't buy it. The dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib, so you might have bought a minivan.</p>", "5557": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't want to drive that. It's such a mom car.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The guy at the dealership said they're not just for moms anymore.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Then again, he did think you were my husband.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> They thought it at the ultrasound. Why not at the car dealership?</p>", "5558": "<p><strong>Daniel:</strong> I love your movie.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, thanks.<br/><strong>Daniel:</strong> It has got to be one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Your love confuses me. Would you like an autograph?<br/><strong>Daniel:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, who do I make it out to?<br/><strong>Daniel:</strong> Daniel.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Daniel:</strong> I have to ask. Were you trying to be that bad, or are you just a terrible actress?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That did not clear things up.</p>", "5559": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I told you, you can't regulate every aspect of our lives.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can if you'd just roll over and accept your fate.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm sorry for bringing this over here.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Believe me, we know what you're going through.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And I think the most helpful thing we can tell you is no backsies.</p>", "5560": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What time do you and Bernadette head out?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> As soon as I get home. We're hoping to make it before dark.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I've never been to Palm Springs.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, you should go. It's terrific. I really thrive anywhere the women and the temperature are over 90.</p>", "5561": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know. If I want to watch old people sweat, I can just FaceTime my family in India.</p>", "5562": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> It's nice you and Bernadette are getting away.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, she wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> So then what are you doing here buying comic books?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, he (Raj) wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes.</p>", "5563": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, as a male, I have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my DNA. Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> We sleep together once a year! You want other partners?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't blame me. Blame your pal, biology. He's the pervert pulling the strings here.</p>", "5564": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with, but the truth is, Amy is just as challenging.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Just as challenging.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> As you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Just as challenging as you?</p>", "5565": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you know that when I get out of the shower, she eyes me up and down like I'm a piece of meat?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, so does Leonard. Can't I just get ready in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up? \"Hey. (chuckles)\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sometimes I would just like to be appreciated for my mind.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Agreed! Thank you!</br></p>", "5566": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> He heard me talking about us going away. I guess he decided to invite himself over?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Should we say something to him?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe. How 'bout, \"Hey, you look like a boiled chicken breast\"?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I meant like, \"What are you doing here?\"<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Nah, that's not gonna hurt his feelings.</p>", "5567": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Why is nothing easy with him?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, here's the thing you need to understand about Sheldon, he's the worst.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I prefer to think of it as high-maintenance.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I prefer to think of myself as 5' 10\", but I still need to get all my pants hemmed.</p>", "5568": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I guess I should have known what I was getting myself into.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't beat yourself up. You've never lived with anyone before.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's true.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And you're starting out with Sheldon Cooper. That's like getting your first pet and having it be- I don't know. What's a kind of pet that ruins your life?</p>", "5569": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> He put a sign up in the bathroom that says, \"Number of days without Amy's hair on the soap.\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, my record was six.</p>", "5570": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I had nothing else to do tonight. The last couple of months, I come here when I know they're not home.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (In the upstairs window) What?!<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> They heard me in the bushes once, but they thought it was a raccoon.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (In the upstairs window) I told you raccoons don't say \"Uh-oh.\"</p>", "5571": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlor will be a good place to meet other women.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, please, you're barely interested in a physical relationship with one person. Why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?</p>", "5572": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Here you go.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Shall we toast?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> To Howard and Bernadette, and the house key they never asked me to return.</p>", "5573": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I don't want to be an inconvenience. You've got all your lady friends -<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Actually, I'm single now.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> What?! When did that happen?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's okay. It's by choice. Well, their choice, and it's not okay.</p>", "5574": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> So you're back out on the dating scene now?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, yeah, a little.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, that must be fun. How's that going?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad.</p>", "5575": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Maybe I should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, don't do that.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> But you did.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Exactly! Learn from my mistakes! No matter where I am at 7:18 A.M., there better be a toilet nearby.</p>", "5576": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> It's just so much easier to give him what he wants.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, true, but think of how much you've accomplished. Who got him to stop Purelling his pocket change?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Me. It was mittens.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mm. And who got him to try a turkey dog?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That was actually Koothrappali, but I did let him spit it out in my hand.</p>", "5577": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, how can you stop now? That's like walking out of Pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy.</p>", "5578": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, who you gonna hit on? The girl in front of us got strawberry. That's your favorite.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. No, if we both like it, I'll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going, \"Aw, no strawberry.\"</p>", "5579": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What about the girl behind the counter?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, she spends her whole day scooping. One arm's probably bigger than the other.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You are truly wise.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'd say wise beyond your years, but you're getting up there.</p>", "5580": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, I am going to tell you a story that I've never told anyone.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> All right.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was 13 years old, and on spring break from college.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Not relating. Go on.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I came home early because they ran out of math to teach me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, now I'm with ya.</br></p>", "5581": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Down the road? Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you, and now you're at an ice cream parlor trying to pick up women!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone.</p>", "5582": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I suppose I should apologize to you, as well.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you. Please understand that I think of you as more of a nanny.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Just finish your ice cream so I can get you home to bed.</p>", "5583": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, and also, I am willing to forgo the bathroom schedule.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? Why does she get that?! We never got that!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Do you want him back?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm very happy for you.</p>", "5584": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, you should know I was never really interested in seeing other women. And to prove how serious I am about us, I'm willing to take our relationship to the next level.<br/>\n-Cut to Sheldon and Amy's bathroom in Apartment 4B-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy Farrah Fowler, will you share this toothbrush holder with me?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I would love to.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did we really need to be here for this?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Call me crazy, but I found it moving.</p>", "5585": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Keep M&amp;Ms in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line.</p>", "5586": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> He startles easily, so, please, no flash photography.</p>", "5587": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> There was water everywhere. It was such a mess.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That stinks. How long are you out of the apartment?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> About five weeks.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ugh! Did you lose anything valuable?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, the pipe was over my closet, so all my clothes are gone.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, so nothing. Great.</p>", "5588": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain? I mean, she's never even seen me unshaven.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You just shaved yesterday. You're good for three months.</p>", "5589": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, is that a yes?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not yet. How will I learn if I'm comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because I'm in my own apartment? Now, if this experiment is going to be valid, I suggest a neutral environment.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Where would you go?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, ideally, an enclosed, self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico. Where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste.</p>", "5590": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait. Why don't you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Interesting. If my official residence were across the hall, I wonder if I'd need to knock every time I came over here.</p>", "5591": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I have to say, I am happy with your ob-gyn.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Cool. 'Cause she says you're doing a great job as \"weird friend who doesn't have to be at every appointment.\"</p>", "5592": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm the son of a gynecologist. I could be helpful.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It would help if you stopped telling me I have a textbook cervix.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> The polite response is, \"Thank you for noticing.\"</p>", "5593": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, I'm very proud of you for trying to live with Amy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, thank you. Of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys. One pair that was neither dating nor living together. One pair that was dating but not living together. One pair that was living together but not dating. And then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating. Although, with that many Sheldons, it'd be such a party, we'd never get anything done.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That was a cute story.</p>", "5594": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, uh, what did you want to ask me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, you've lived with your significant other for some time. I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mm. Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, Leonard and I were very happy before you came along.</p>", "5595": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Enjoy having the place to yourselves.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's Penny's bedroom. Plenty of men have gone before.</br></p>", "5596": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> This is ridiculous. The doctor knows what the baby is, the ultrasound tech knows, Raj knows, his Grey's Anatomy online fan group probably knows.</p>", "5597": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Is it weird we don't?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. Maybe the surprise will make it more fun. Like magic tricks. Remember how disappointed you were when I explained the never-ending hanky?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I was disappointed to see the man I was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But how delightful was it when I pulled out a bouquet at the end of those scarves? It'll be the same thing when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Everyone said I could do better.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But you didn't listen, and presto change-o, my baby's inside you. Ta da!</p>", "5598": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon? I know we took coitus off the table, but I was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, it's funny you should ask, because I was wondering how you'd feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall.</p>", "5599": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's it. It's Sheldon's bedtime. He is in for the night.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (chuckles) It's weird. This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. Unless they feel sad, then it's different.</p>", "5600": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, what do you want to do?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know exactly what we are gonna do.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? You're a genius, and that's the first thing you come up with?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, Sheldon's not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ugh. Can we just have sex?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, don't worry. Once you see my sweet moves, sex is inevitable.</p>", "5601": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> The kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.</p>", "5602": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, hey, hey, you're not going anywhere.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (yawning) I know, I was there.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, wake up! We're gonna put in a lot of late nights.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How late?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, I don't know, midnight, one.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> One o'clock? I'm not a raccoon.</p>", "5603": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed, I let your head hit the wall and I laughed.</p>", "5604": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I'll go. I like a party.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, to be honest, it's not like a \"party\" party. It's more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on what's going on in other fields. I don't know why I called it a party, sorry.</p>", "5605": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Thanks again for breakfast.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I didn't get to see you last night. It was the least I could do.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (To Howard) You shouldn't have made the alarm code his birthday.</p>", "5606": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, what should we do today?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, I appreciate it, but you don't have to spend your day off with me.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I don't mind. Oh, you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Not really.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, come on, we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I get enough of that when I take Howard to my grandmother's for Christmas.</p>", "5607": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, I know, why don't we get started on clearing out the baby's room?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Isn't it a little early for that?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You have to get to it eventually.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, there's so much junk in there, it's embarrassing.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How can you be embarrassed around me? I'm gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't think you are.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You didn't think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here I am.</p>", "5608": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hi, Bert. This is my friend, Penny.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Hey, come on in. I'll gonna go turn on some rock music.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (chuckles) That's a geology joke. Bert's a geologist.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> And a joker.</p>", "5609": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, it's complicated. He finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine uncomfortably intimate.</p>", "5610": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Gentlemen, I am ready to work. To quote The Martian, \"Let's science the feces out of this!\" That's \"The Martian\" the book and \"The Martian\" the movie, not Marvin the Martian. Although to quote Marvin the Martian, \"I claim this planet in the name of Mars.\"</p>", "5611": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So should we talk to each other or mingle?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't know where everyone is.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I could see him eating one or two guests, but not a whole party.</br></p>", "5612": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Why don't you just go home?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I can do this. I just, I just need another energy drink.<br/>\nOh, no.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I want another one.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's a craving. That's a sign of chemical dependency.</p>", "5613": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don't we just decide on a theme for the nursery?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Does it really need one?]<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Of course it does. Didn't your baby room have a theme?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, it doubled as my dad's office, and he was a cop, so I guess the theme was bloody homicide photos.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh.</p>", "5614": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> But anyway why don't we just take a step back and start with a color? Right? There are so many amazing ones. Red, blue, green, purple-<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Are you just gonna name all the colors?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, not now.</p>", "5615": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, okay, so Amy's cool, Sheldon's cool. Tell me about Leonard.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Who?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard Hofstadter.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Oh, him. I guess he's all right. Apparently he tricked some hot girl into marrying him.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's me, I'm her. And you know, he didn't trick me. He just wore me down.</p>", "5616": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Raj, why don't I care about anything?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm sorry?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's my baby. I should care about nurseries and colors, and I don't. What's wrong with me?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind.</p>", "5617": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, I'll just toss this out to the room. Um, I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps.<br/>\nNow, I couldn't find a caffeine patch, but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository. Yeah, you know, there's an interesting fact about the rectum--<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon!</p>", "5618": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon! We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink, don't have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove 'em wherever you want, I don't care!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You don't shove them. They come with an easy-glide applicator.</p>", "5619": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's okay, we'll figure something out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But what if we can't?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It'll be fine. You'll see. Sheldon? Buddy?<br/>\n*Sheldon asleep and snoring while resting on Leonard's chest*<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> When the baby gets here, you gotta teach me that.</p>", "5620": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Hello, Rajesh. Are you calling to ask for money?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What? No.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Are you calling to ask for things that cost money?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Great. What's up?</p>", "5621": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> What seems to be the trouble?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Something's wrong. I don't care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into. Honestly, I'm not even sure I like babies.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Look, some people are baby people, and some people are not baby people. It doesn't mean you won't love your own baby.</p>", "5622": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Um, I don't really know how to say this.<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Well, you could try starting with \"sir\".<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Right. Sorry, sir.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He said start with it, not end with it.</p>", "5623": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, pressure's off.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wanna see a movie?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Popcorn's on me.</p>", "5624": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Did you tell anyone?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, you told me not to.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I bet it was Barbara Chen in retrovirus. She might have heard me throwing up one morning. Every since she got the hearing aid, she thinks she's so great.</p>", "5625": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Why don't you want anyone to know?<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> 'Cause I'm up for a major immunotherapy study, and if they find out I'm pregnant they might give it to someone else.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Would they really do that?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I know they would. They did it to Barbara Chen last year when I told everyone she was pregnant.</br></p>", "5626": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh God, I feel so bad, I just lied to her.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, but you did it so well. That's amazing! It's like watching a sculptor, but your clay was lies.</p>", "5627": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you still upset about people finding out you're pregnant?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm furious.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sure, sure. Uh, did you ever figure out who told?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No. I confronted Barbara Chen, but she claimed she didn't know what I was talking about.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hmm. Well, I guess it's just gonna remain a mystery, you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights. (laughs)<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It had to be Barbara. I've been trying to figure out a way to get back at her. Do you think using her work computer to Google \"how to be a prostitute\" is over the line?</p>", "5628": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, all right, honey, you know what? There was something I was too scared to tell you yesterday, a-and now I'm just balls-out terrified to tell you, but the truth is it wasn't Barbara Chen, it was me. I'm the reason everyone knows.</p>", "5629": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, quick question. Am I allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Am I allowed to inform him that Colonel Sanders was never actually in the military?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm getting enraged.</p>", "5630": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where did you go to school?<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> MIT.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, hey, me, too.<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> I should have known. Behind every great invention is an MIT mind.<br/>\n(Sheldon gasps, but controls himself)</p>", "5631": "<p><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> All you need to worry about is, right now, it's (wide gesture) this big, and we need it to be (small gesture) this big.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's a lot less big.<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Yes, it's (wide gesture) this much less big.</p>", "5632": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Something happen at the meeting?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They made me promise I wouldn't talk.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And you talked?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, now, see? You knew what was gonna happen. Why didn't they?</p>", "5633": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, if it makes you feel any better, Bernadette's mad at me, too.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mmm. If it makes you feel any better, a parasitoid wasp known as Oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why would that make me feel better?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better? At least mine was educational.</p>", "5634": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We didn't. Sheldon did.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And you just let him?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country, and the funding is substantial.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, but mostly, there was an awkward pause, and I broke it by saying, \"Okay.\"</p>", "5635": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I never realized this building was classified.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe that's because it's classified.</p>", "5636": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, also, if they did have coitus, we'll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.</p>", "5637": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It is funny when you think about it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe to you. You didn't get a $500 traffic ticket.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Because you were driving like a lunatic.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then yeah, okay.</p>", "5638": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, uh, Randall, can't believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in California.<br/><strong>Randall:</strong> Well, good thing I was a nonviolent offender, otherwise I couldn't have left the state.</p>", "5639": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, make sure you tell him that you weren't home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door.</p>", "5640": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, sure, I can meet with you on Thursday. Caltech is fine. Yeah, and may I ask what this is about? (laughs) I may not?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> (To Bernadette) That's what he said to me!</br></p>", "5641": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> You're not seriously going to visit each other.<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> And why wouldn't we?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oh please, you're just saying this to antagonize me.<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> Oh, not at all. Mary happens to be a wonderful woman. And if it antagonizes you, that's just a bonus.</p>", "5642": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mary, I'm sorry you're in the middle of this.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> No, no, nothing to be sorry about. I genuinely like your father.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What? But he's a mediocre academic. And according to Beverly, his sexual prowess is subpar. He's basically Leonard with a bigger prostate.</p>", "5643": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard? Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You realize you and I could become brothers.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We're not gonna be brothers. We're not gonna be step brothers. Go to sleep.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I hope you're right. 'Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother's wife is weird.</p>", "5644": "<p><strong>Wyatt:</strong> So how's the world of pharmaceuticals treating you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.<br/><strong>Susan:</strong> See what happens when you work hard?<br/><strong>Randall:</strong> Hey, she just sells drugs. I had to make 'em.</p>", "5645": "<p><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong>: If I may, I can assure you, your mother and I did nothing more than share a cab and a conversation.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did that conversation include the phrase \"your genitals are a joy to behold\"?</p>", "5646": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, they haven't done anything wrong. I think it's nice they're hitting it off.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that's still no reason to rush into anything. Look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I, we didn't even hold hands for two years.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It was a lot hotter than it sounds.</p>", "5647": "<p><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> You're a patient young lady.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, hey! She's mine! Take a cold shower, grandpa!</p>", "5648": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What's the worst that could come of this meeting?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. They take the invention away, and I get nothing?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, that's not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What's the point of that story?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I just read a book about Oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off.</p>", "5649": "<p><strong>Wyatt:</strong> It's nice to meet the woman who raised this fine young man. I'm looking forward to meeting his father.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Prepare to be disappointed.</p>", "5650": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Nice to see you again, Dr. Hofstadter. I'm, uh, Leonard's friend, Stuart.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Nice to see you, too.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hi, I'm Stuart.<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> Ooh, I'm Alfred, Leonard's father.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh! Oh, hi. Uh, I'm sorry, did you two want to sit together?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> No!<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> No!<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I was wondering why the front row was available.</p>", "5651": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> That's great, now they know where I live.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What are you talking about? They've always known where you live.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother's house.</p>", "5652": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Not just Leonard and Penny's love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Speaking of love, STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing.</p>", "5653": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Anybody have anything snarky to say about that? Didn't think so.</p>", "5654": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, you and I have our ups and downs. But I have always considered you my family. Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. I don't always show it, but you are of great importance to me. Both of you.</p>", "5655": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> There's a lot of traffic. Are we gonna be okay?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> You'll be at the airport an hour before your flight.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Good. Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Hey, I will not have you be disrespectful to me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes ma'am.</br></p>", "5656": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, your mother's an attractive woman. You need to get used to the fact that men are going to be interest in her.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, and you need to drive the car and mind your business.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I will not have you be disrespectful to me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What- you're not my mother.<br/><strong>Mary CoopeRaj: </strong> Don't you be disrespectful to her.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes ma'am.<br/><strong>Mary CoopeRaj: </strong> You'll get there. You've just gotta put some zing on it.</p>", "5657": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, look, then forget about her, let's do it for us. We could keep it small and informal. This time we can invite our families.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is your brother out of prison?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.</p>", "5658": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> It was so nice of Leonard and Penny to invite me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, actually, I-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It sure was.</p>", "5659": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny's really looking forward to seeing you.<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> Ah, she's a sweetie. You got a good one there, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thanks, Dad.<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> How the hell did you do that?</p>", "5660": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know what to do. It's the Air Force. I mean, should I respond to their e-mail? Ignore it?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You can't ignore it. It's not that postcard that says it's time to go back to the dentist.</p>", "5661": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you guys doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, well, we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, let me try.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hmm. Atom of hydrogen. Adam of Maroon 5. Mic drop.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, who is Mike Drop?</p>", "5662": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're really going without me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy, and we'll save a spot in line for you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You don't have the authority to save places in the line. If I do that, I'll be cutting.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> People do it all the time.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know the golden rule of line etiquette. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.</p>", "5663": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow. Didn't even make it out of the parking lot. Uh, you know what, enough about Leonard. Let's talk about you. What would you like to do while you're here?<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> Dear, I'm a psychiatrist. You don't have to avoid having intimate conversations with me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I'd actually like for us to be close, but maybe we start with our favourite books and work our way up to my husband's sex organs.<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> Very well. What's the last book you read?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?</p>", "5664": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm sorry, I've been going on and on.<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> Oh, it's all right, dear. Sheldon has a brilliant and complicated mind. It's understandable that being in a relationship with him could be trying.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I called him babe once. He asked me to get a drug test.</p>", "5665": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him?<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> Oh, well, that still could be a big step for Sheldon.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Three minutes. And he used a kitchen timer. I felt like a soft-boiled egg.</p>", "5666": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, being in a relationship with Leonard also comes with its challenges.<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> Yes. Well, what can you do?</p>", "5667": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So, Beverly, did you know Penny is the number three sales rep at our pharmaceutical company?<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> Oh, I didn't realize you two worked together.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, we don't exactly. I'm a microbiologist for the research team.<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> Oh, what are you currently developing?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> That's interesting. I just attended a lecture on pediatric anxiety.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, was it, uh, Dr. Janofski? I just saw his TED Talk.<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> It was.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, let's get back to Penny. Hey, weren't you telling me something great about your company car?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Um, it has seat warmers.</p>", "5668": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> How long have I had spinach in my teeth?<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> Since the airport, dear.</p>", "5669": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, how'd it go?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It went well. Yeah, I've learned that if you never say you're sorry, the times you do really puts them on their heels. Uh, Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties.</p>", "5670": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, please don't.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, uh, I couldn't help but notice that you cut the line.<br/><strong>Guy:</strong> Oh, uh, I'm with my friends. It's cool.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, no. It's not cool. If there were reserved seating, and we all had tickets, that would be fine. But this line is first-come, first-served. Not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. Right here.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You need to go to the back of the line.<br/><strong>Guy:</strong> Uh, who made you line monitor?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade. And my slogan was a line that's straight is a line thats great.</br></p>", "5671": "<p><strong>Beverly:</strong> That was very nice of Sheldon to apologize.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, he's come a long way. Or a short way very slowly, so it feels like a long way.</p>", "5672": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What about Joss Whedon's work makes you think he'd be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?<br/><strong>Guy:</strong> The Avengers are rule-breakers. Being vengeful is in their job description.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They work for SHIELD, which is a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government. Do you work for a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government?<br/><strong>Guy:</strong> As a matter of fact I do. At a little place called the DMV.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> He's got him there. The D even stands for department.</p>", "5673": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, right now, at the back of this line, there's a movie fan like you who's not going to get in, because this person simply doesn't care. Yeah, well, 61 years ago, there was another person at the back of the line and her name was Rosa Parks.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (To Raj) Okay, you may have to pretend you're black to get us out of here.</p>", "5674": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Buddy, let it go.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I can't. This isn't right.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You did everything you could.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I could've done more.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Now, now, you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer. That's all anyone could ask.</p>", "5675": "<p><strong>Beverly:</strong> I'm still human, Penny. Not getting invited to my own son's wedding is difficult to ignore.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I know how you feel. She didn't invite any of us.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It was spur of the moment.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> But we did get to see a live stream of it on the Internet.<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> I could've watched it on the Internet?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (Sarcastically to Bernadette) Thank you.</p>", "5676": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow. Okay. Well, um, how about this? Maybe while you're still in town, Leonard and I could have another small ceremony. You know, if you're interested.<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> I would find that perfectly acceptable.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> She would find it perfectly acceptable. You guys saw it. We bonded!</p>", "5677": "<p><strong>Claire:</strong> So, I got to ask, does Raj bring around other girls?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, you know, I'm not really around that much. Amy knows much more than I do.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't think you have anything to worry about. Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah. He still has an AOL address.</p>", "5678": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend, I won a night of wine tasting from work.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That sounds fun.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How come scientists don't win free stuff like salespeople do?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> 'Cause we're not in it for the stuff. (Puts his arm around Bernadette) We're in it for the groupies.</p>", "5679": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Personally, I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I also say don't contradict me in front of my friends, but that you don't remember.</p>", "5680": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's okay, you should go.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You sure?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Of course.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, give her a break from, well, come on.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, it's you and me.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Me? How? Why?</p>", "5681": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I guess we could give it a try.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, little lady, you've heard of party hearty, get ready to party hardly.<br/></p>", "5682": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, you think it'd be okay if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure. I'd like to meet her.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, thats great. I've been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, but I won't be there.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Funny how that worked out.</p>", "5683": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. And we're going to prove that we don't need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, good for you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no bubble baths either. They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, have fun.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We're leaving now!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, we're leaving, love you, bye.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Boy, do I love restrictions.</p>", "5684": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I brought sparkling cider.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, the bubbles tickle my nose. I'll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it.</p>", "5685": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> H-O gauge trains are 1/87th scale. N gauge are 1/160th scale. And that brings us to Z gauge, at a - you could easily swallow it, dont ask how I know - 1 to 220.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm sorry, I have to ask.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When I was five, I ingested a Z gauge locomotive. I spent the next three days saying, \"I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it.\"</br></p>", "5686": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I have to admit, I've been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Me, too.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why didn't you say something?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Same reason I don't talk about ass cancer. It's not a pleasant topic.</p>", "5687": "<p><strong>Claire:</strong> Hey, Raj.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, Claire. Good, you're here. Guys, this is my friend Claire. We're casually dating, and there's no need for any further questions about it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Would you like a glass of wine?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I said no questions.</p>", "5688": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're gonna enjoy this. I designed it especially for you.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay, but just for a little bit.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I have a feeling that once you start, you're not gonna want to or be allowed to stop.</p>", "5689": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. As you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening you've had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they've ever been. The end.</p>", "5690": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I get why he's annoyed.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, then you don't understand what's happening. See, Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You love The Simpsons.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I love Lisa Simpson.</p>", "5691": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> How?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the Kings Guard to do her bidding.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Cersei uses her body to manipulate men. Penny just takes me to The LEGO Store.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay. Oh, how about this? Stuart's dressed like a brother of the Night's Watch, and they don't have sex.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> There you go.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's true.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fair enough.</p>", "5692": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, where you been?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Did you get graham crackers? I mean, are - uh, is the baby okay?</p>", "5693": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. Well, shall we check each other for ticks?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Well, suit yourself. Who wants to check me?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> On the other hand, safety first.</p>", "5694": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Wow, it's really coming down.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> This sucks.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And there goes our hike.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, not our hike, now we have to stay safe and warm!</p>", "5695": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, we could still go. A little rain isn't gonna kill us.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You'll wish it would kill you.</p>", "5696": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay. Calm down. I'll go first. All right, lets see. Never have I ever...<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> She's trying to think of something she's never done before. This could take a while.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Very funny. Okay, never have I ever ... yeah, you know what? Let's just circle back.</p>", "5697": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm surprised you would do that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldn't, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What, he arrested you for that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, he didn't do anything. So I said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren't you doing your job? You know, maybe I should arrest you for impersonating a police officer.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And then you got arrested.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, and how!</p>", "5698": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What? Are you gonna cry?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Is it baby hormones or actually sad?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I can't tell anymore.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'll go get him.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> And bring back the bear!</p>", "5699": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> This game's dangerous. I could get you in trouble.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> How?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, never have I ever used Sheldon's toothbrush to clean the sink.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Fine, is that how you want to play this? All right, never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Never should've told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.</p>", "5700": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay. My turn. Um, never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend's world in bed.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You know the rules. Drink.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (Leonard looks to Penny for approval) Yeah, go ahead.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (To Sheldon and Amy) That's right.</br></p>", "5701": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I appreciate the apology, but it's really not necessary. I overstepped my bounds.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, Raj, you've been great. I just, I need to start doing my part around here.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I hear that.</p>", "5702": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, if that's the case, is there anything I can do to help?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, not right now. But we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby's heartbeat.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really? It's okay if I listen with you?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Of course.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, look at that. It's weird again.</p>", "5703": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, you have every right to be mad. And what you said is true. You do make more money than me. So I had no right to do what I did. And I'm so sorry. I hope you can forgive me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> How long have you had this secret account?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, how much you got in there?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Six thousand, four hundred and twenty-seven dollars. Forty-seven dollars once my nana's birthday check gets here.</p>", "5704": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I love you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I love you, too.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, guess I gotta drink.</p>", "5705": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Never have I ever canceled a dentist appointment.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, uh, never have I ever put my foot in the ocean.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Never have I ever honked if I liked anything.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, uh, never have I ever thrown, caught or touched a Frisbee.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Never have I ever put salt on my food without trying it first.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, we all have a past.</p>", "5706": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I didn't understand your e-mail.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, can you repeat that? You're breaking up.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I didn't understand your e-mail.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah. Yeah, I had to get a little creative because the S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, is that a yes?</p>", "5707": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, guys.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey. What are you doing here?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We heard there were some sexy scientists working hard all weekend.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yup, so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for 'em.</p>", "5708": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Soup, sandwiches and emasculation, just like my mom used to make.</p>", "5709": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> After you wrap the body in reflective tape, the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Like this?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, perfect.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And it helps to have small, delicate fingers. So don't be discouraged if you can't do it as fast as me and Howard.</p>", "5710": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You want to come with us?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm kind of getting into the groove here.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay. We'll be back as soon as we can.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (To Bernadette) Okay, so what is solder?</p>", "5711": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Will you please tell me where were going?<br/><br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sorry, you're on a need-to-know basis.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm driving the car. I need to know.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Right.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So where are we going?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I meant turn right, and you missed it. Maybe you do need to know.</p>", "5712": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong>  Welcome to my Fortress of Shame.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm sorry. What, what am I looking at?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's basically everything I've ever owned. Um, every book, every tee shirt, every piece of broken electronics. Just all of it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> All of it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc bags.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay. Well, I would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of. So I'm gonna need a minute.</p>", "5713": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I used to collect them as a child. The spiral of scales open in the Fibonacci sequence. A fact that, when you tell your brother, gets a golf ball thrown at your head.</p>", "5714": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You've tried to work with him before. It hasn't gone well. Why is this time gonna be any different?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Is the fetus helping you? 'Cause that's cheating.</p>", "5715": "<p>(After Sheldon runs out of his party)<br><strong>Adam West:</strong> I still get paid, don't I?</br></p>", "5716": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ready when you are, Professor Hawking.<br/><strong>Stephen Hawking:</strong> And a one, and a two.<br/>\nAll: Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Sheldon. Happy birthday to you. (to you.)</p>", "5717": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Hello, I hope I'm not too early.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, no, no. Come on in.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> And how is the radiant mommy-to-be?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Doing great.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> You're pregnant?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Sounds like something a member of the group might know.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, birthday party first. Pity party later.</p>", "5718": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you crazy? How can you put Michael Keaton in front of Christian Bale?<br/><strong>Adam West:</strong> Oh, please. Even my poodles know Bale's overrated.</p>", "5719": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you! That's why I say Keaton's number one. He brought a sense of humor to the role.<br/><strong>Adam West:</strong> Oh, if you're gonna factor in a sense of humor, then I should be at the top of the list. It should be me, Keaton, Kilmer, Lego, Bale, and that pretty boy Clooney.</p>", "5720": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Can we just all agree we're worried about Affleck?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, of course.<br/><strong>Adam West:</strong> What's an Affleck?</p>", "5721": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, um uh, thank you all so much for coming. Uh, Beverly. Wil Wheaton. Adam West, for some reason.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Batman finally came to your party.<br/><strong>Adam West:</strong> Happy birthday, Sherman.</p>", "5722": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Raj?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Spending Valentine's Day with Emily.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You don't sound very excited about it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, I am, I am. I g... I guess I'm still wondering if Emily and I are right for each other.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You mean the strong, sexy angel I can't stop thinking about? Who can say?</p>", "5723": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, you really gonna break up with her?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I have broken up with my fair share of guys. I mean, how many times did I break up with Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I stopped counting at four.</p>", "5724": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, and we are live in 22 minutes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm nervous. I hope people will be around to watch even though it's Valentine's Day.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> People who are fans of an Internet show about flags? Trust me, they're around.</p>", "5725": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, bad news. The matre D' said it's gonna be at least an hour.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> An hour? What? That's crazy. We have a reservation.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So what did you say?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> \"Thanks, sorry to bother you.\" But I said it like a badass.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, well, can't you, like, slip him some money or something?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? I've never done that before. Does it work?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Do people like money - is that what you're asking?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> A lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that's basically national sex night?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sorry. You're pretty, I'm stupid.</p>", "5726": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Look, I know you think I'm not right for Sheldon, but trust me, I'm his best shot. You have no idea how much I put up with!<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> I know more than you think I do.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really? You know what it's like to have date night ruined because Google changed their font?</p>", "5727": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Because when you broke up with Sheldon, it hurt him deeply, and I don't want to see that happen again.</p>", "5728": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And to memorialize this occasion, here are your commemorative T-shirts.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> \"Sheldon Cooper apologized to me.\"<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> \"And he made it all better.\"</p>", "5729": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Fine, how about this? You're making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight, and I wish you'd stop.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Oh, you want me to stop? No problem.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, come on, please don't leave!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Point of clarification, are you still going on the trip? Because if not-<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Don't worry, you're good.</p>", "5730": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I caused that fight, I feel terrible. Wait, I can do that better.<br>\nI caused that fight. I feel terrible!<br/>\nYeah, wow, I don't know which one I like more.</br></p>", "5731": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, was the fight really bad?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. As a fight, it was excellent. She used harsh language and slammed the door. Although as I say this, that might not have been what you were asking.</p>", "5732": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What is wrong with you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look at him, caring about what's wrong with me. That is some top-shelf empathy. Hey, well, we should start a club.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You went to Emily's to apologize. And when you left, she was crying.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That is true. Well, I suppose I should apologize again.<br/>\n*Everybody shouts No!*<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Is she okay?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, I calmed her down. But she's not going to Vegas if he's going.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wait, that's an option? I didn't know that was an option.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that is fine, because I've decided that I won't be joining you. I've realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's very mature of you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I've been on a little trip myself recently. Not to Sin City but to Sincere City. Where instead of genital warts, the only growth you'll come back with is personal growth.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And there's your next T-shirt.</p>", "5733": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do we do? Kick them off?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> If we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them; no questions asked.</p>", "5734": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Uh, well, I know the remodel is coming up, so I thought I'd make it easy on you guys and find my own place.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wow, I thought I was done getting lucky tonight.</p>", "5735": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What should we write?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, how about, \"We might be Footprints on the Moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon.\"<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Someday you're gonna make an amazing grandma.</p>", "5736": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> He is so cool! No hard feelings, but I'm throwing my hypothetical bra at him.</p>", "5737": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What are you doing in my room? Stop it, that's mine! Why are you so strong?!</p>", "5738": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> People are also delighted by your love of pranks. (Softly) For example, Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee. It wasn't \"replace it with Folger's crystals,\" I'll tell you that much.</p>", "5739": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Look at this. Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That is so cool! Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.</p>", "5740": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Who's Trent?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, he's our fan.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Fan of what?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Uh, did you forget? We're in a band.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You mean because you played one time in the comic book store?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And at the children's hospital until they asked us to leave.</p>", "5741": "<p><strong>Dave:</strong> This is delicious.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Dave:</strong> Been a long time since I had a home-cooked meal.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> When you were married, did your wife cook?<br/><strong>Dave:</strong> Not at first, no. But when she began cheating on me with a French chef, she became quite the wiz in the kitchen.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So, a little silver lining.<br/><strong>Dave:</strong> I suppose. Yeah, nothing takes the sting out of a shattered life like a properly-seasoned bowl of onion soup.</p>", "5742": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How long have you known Adam?<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> A few years.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mm-hmm. And what are you getting him back for?</p>", "5743": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, Barry, there's a Swedish team trying to run our experiment before us.<br/>\nCan't you spare any?<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Be honest, if the shoe was on the other foot, would you do this for me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No chance.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He said be honest, so I was honest. Didn't your mother tell you? It's the best policy.</p>", "5744": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Why do you need Kripke? Why don't you just go to Party City for helium?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We'd have to go to every Party City in California.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo.</p>", "5745": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> If you wanted me to stay out later, you should've given me more spending money.</br></p>", "5746": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, hold on, hold on. How do we know that you're not gonna take the money and drive away?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What ya doing, Skippy?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us.<br/>\nYou give us the helium first.<br/><strong>Dealer:</strong> Oh, how do I know you're not gonna drive away without paying me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Guess I'm not the only one who watches '70s television crime dramas.</p>", "5747": "<p><strong>Dealer:</strong> Huh. All these years, I've been using stalemate, when I really mean impasse. I feel foolish.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?<br/><strong>Dealer:</strong> Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it be a Mexican standoff? Everybody knows you need three sides for that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not necessarily. Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm.<br/><strong>Dealer:</strong> Hmm, I don't follow.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let me give you an example. Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your e-mail, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald.<br/>\nFrom that, I figured out where you live and where you work.<br/>\nNow, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh, \"You give us the helium or I'll turn you in to the authorities.\"<br/><strong>Dealer:</strong> Is that a threat?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, exactly. See, you're getting it.<br/><strong>Dealer:</strong> Yeah, well, I know where you work, all right? And if you mess with me, I'll report you, then I'll pound your asses into the ground.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perfect! Now we really are in a Mexican stand-off.</p>", "5748": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Ew, check out his tiny teeth. He looks like a man-dolphin.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, if he's good in bed, she can throw him a fish.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (high-pitched) I love you, Amy. (dolphin sounds)</p>", "5749": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What if the helium dealer rats us out? What if Kripke asks where we got it? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I don't have an Uncle Harvey?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The dealer doesn't care, Kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot.</p>", "5750": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> It's going fine. It's mostly just been meeting people for coffee.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wha?!<br/>\nI thought we were all- Never mind.</p>", "5751": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can you give us a minute?<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Take your time. I'll walk out backwards for dramatic effect.</p>", "5752": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Stuart, believe it or not, I understand. You know, before I met Sheldon, I was alone for a really long time. I was so desperate for people to like me, when I met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Okay, we're all feeling it. Yes, I'll go out with you.</p>", "5753": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I smell funny. I taste salty.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're just sweaty from exercise.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And kind of delicious. I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the center of me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know it only takes one doctor's finger.</p>", "5754": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, we're going to dinner. You want to come?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I wish I could, but I realized I've become too emotionally vulnerable, so, like an operating system, I'm restoring my life to the last stable version, which was in 2003, the day before I met Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You heard him, no.</p>", "5755": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would you pass the mustard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure. Hey, you wanna hear a fun fact about mustard?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is it that the glucosinolates that give mustard its flavor were evolved by the cabbage family as a defense against caterpillars?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard.</p>", "5756": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> This was Feynman's van? This is so cool.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, nothing's been changed since he drove it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And talked about physics with them.</p>", "5757": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, look! The lug nut's off.</p>", "5758": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hands off. I'm mad at you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Look, I know it's a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years it'll pay for itself.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What will pay for itself?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Doesn't matter. What are you mad about?</p>", "5759": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How many times do I have to tell you, I have no interest in this woman.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, well maybe she has interest in you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In Leonard? Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see that's unlikely.</p>", "5760": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Why are marine biologists always so cute?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know, but I'd like to get lost in her Bermuda triangle.</br></p>", "5761": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's not helpful.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Then I won't say I'd like to cover three quarters of her surface area.</p>", "5762": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Whatever. Put us on the Internet. I've always wanted a wedding with a comments section.</p>", "5763": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You seem to be headed somewhere. May I walk with you?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Boy, I'm glad we're going out again.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> We're not back together.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why? Is there someone else? Just couldn't wait for that first notch on your bed post. Could you?</p>", "5764": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, you're going to a wedding alone. That's sad.</p>", "5765": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, if you're hungry, there's a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thanks, but I don't like glitter on my scrambled eggs.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay.</p>", "5766": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, what do you think? Should we run next door and grab a bite?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, what if they call our names?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, don't worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, and the fairy tale continues.</p>", "5767": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, mother.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Shelly. How's my baby doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers. Unless you're open to praying for a bee hive to fall on her head.</p>", "5768": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That was really intense. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers' market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables.</p>", "5769": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> So, have you and Penny set a wedding date? <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, we're kind of taking it slow. <br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I see. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What does that mean? <br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> You've been on and off with this woman for seven years and engaged for one year. One has to wonder if there's a problem. Are you having satisfactory intercourse? <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, Mother. <br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Only satisfactory. I see. </p>", "5770": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> How about we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe? You know, like shoes, or how cute little Chinese babies are. </p>", "5771": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> But look how well you turned out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'd feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me?</p>", "5772": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It's like the best one they make, I just can't get it to work.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'll figure it out.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It streams HD videos straight your phone when it's flying.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Nice. Where were you when I was single?</p>", "5773": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last-minute things. You know, makeup, underwear, clothes.\n</p>", "5774": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> The problem with commencement speeches is that they're boring. Ooh, do you own a T-shirt cannon?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know. Why do I own one?<br/></p>", "5775": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I think it's really nice that you're sharing this experience with Penny.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> I thought it'd be fun to show her my old stomping grounds. I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me.</br></p>", "5776": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> With a beautiful girl on your arm.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.</p>", "5777": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, that seems simple enough. Initiating calibration sequence. *flips switch rapidly* One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. *lights on drone turn solid yellow* Well, I suppose ten is technically \"at least ten.\" But they're still getting at least one angry letter.</p>", "5778": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Now I rotate it horizontally on its center axis until the lights turn green.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Initiating rotation sequence. Don't look at me. Initiate.</p>", "5779": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Are you still dating that dermatologist? <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> If you could feel how soft my skin is, you wouldn't have to ask.</p>", "5780": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Oh, and there's something else I wanted to ask you. Why did you spend a month's rent on a toy helicopter?! <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, you're where that bill goes.</p>", "5781": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> I'm tired of indulging your foolish lifest<x>yle. It's time you learned responsibility. And the only way to teach you that is to cut off your allowance. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, Daddy, no! There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility. I know, you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week.</x></p>", "5782": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> No, my mind is made up. Starting now, you're on your own. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> But, Daddy, I miss my family so much, and with you and Mummy getting a divorce, I feel sad and empty. Buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. So while I can't hug you every day, flying that helicopter really makes--<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> I'm cutting you off. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence? </p>", "5783": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We did it! Oh! God, if it's this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it.</p>", "5784": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hi. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, where'd you go? <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I got you a little something to cheer you up. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? Sex last night, pancakes this morning-- am I dying?</p>", "5785": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I called your old high school and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? That's amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, now about those, uh, they came from a costume shop, and all they had left was sexy graduate, so they might be a little short. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Short and sexy, that's my wheelhouse.</p>", "5786": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You can't return it. Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think me<x>taphorically. But he was in the bathroom for a while.</x></p>", "5787": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Anyway, speaking of Daddy. I had a very strange conversation with him. He said he couldn't afford to send me money any more because of his active social life. <br/><strong>Mrs. Koothrappali:</strong> What does that mean, \"active social life\"? <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, let's not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to. Let's talk about you.</p>", "5788": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sorry. Ah, maybe it's for the best. I hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What's the first one? <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Suicide. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wrong. Obesity.</p>", "5789": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You guys don't have to go to the trouble. I'm back in the money now. I can just buy another helicopter. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's not about the money. It's about solving a problem. It's why I became an engineer. It's what I like to do, it's what I'm trained to do. It's who I am.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, look at you, the little engineer that could.</p>", "5790": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I call tech support all the time.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> You call tech support!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ha-ha!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What a baby!</br></p>", "5791": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm so lucky I take after you. <br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> You think you take after me? <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I try to. I certainly wouldn't be a scientist if you hadn't been my role model. <br/>\n*to Sheldon, Howard and Bernadette after talking to his dad* <br/>\nWho wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?!</p>", "5792": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So you really think they liked it? <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, sweetie, it was the best speech I--<br/>\n*Drone comes through the door, knocking Penny and Leonard off their feet*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't worry, everyone in here is safe.</p>", "5793": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space, like the Golden Record on Voyager, were heavily criticized. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record pla<x>yer. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Eh. Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak &amp; Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.</x></p>", "5794": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Now that we're all on the same page, let's get together tonight and work on it. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Get together tonight? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, I think we should do it right now. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Tonight works better for me.</p>", "5795": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> *thinking* Okay, it's just an audition. Why am I nervous? Maybe it's a good thing. Just means I want it. And I can have it. This feels right. Why did I ever give this up? *opens door and sees room packed with women reading sc<x>ripts* *speaking quietly* I'm starting to remember.</x></p>", "5796": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should I get on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie, but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information.</p>", "5797": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Some times Raj and I feel pushed aside.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA. You didn't even think to ask me and Leonard.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know what, you're right. I should have asked you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And if he does ask you, go. It's amazing.</p>", "5798": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Now if we're talking about being left out, you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I recommend that too. That was a magical experience.</p>", "5799": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I sure did. My goodness. From Jabba's head to ice cream with Darth Vader, I'm having a heck of a ride.</p>", "5800": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm glad you have a new appreciation for you job.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I do. And you know, I don't think I've ever thanked you properly for helping me get it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Properly? At all? It's just words I've never heard.</p>", "5801": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Now you're making some real money, maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank you dinner.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And you probably have to invite your other friend because she overheard you talking about it and it would be awkward to exclude her.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, okay.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How about now?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All right.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Don't forget your wallet.</p>", "5802": "<p>Alien: That soft pink alien looks delicious. I could eat.<br/>\n*Sheldon performs Vulcan salute*</p>", "5803": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, would you like to hear some songs I've rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah. I like music. I like science. I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it!</p>", "5804": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> *singing in the tune of \"Bingo Was His Name-o\"* There was a scientist who had a theory, and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. J-A-M-E-S, C-L-E-R-K, space, M-A-X-W-E-L-L, and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. There was a scientist who had a theory, and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. *claps* A-M-E-S--<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, okay, we get it.</p>", "5805": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Anyway, if you're looking for Leonard, he's with Koothrappali.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> No, actually, I came to talk to you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How nice!</br></p>", "5806": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing ob<x>jects off the tracks. Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, I prefer the more accurate \"cow exploder.\"</x></p>", "5807": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Can I be in charge of pricing? I've been going to garage sales my whole life.<br/>\nCan you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, Amy's in charge of pricing, and being seventy-five.</p>", "5808": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Boy, some people are just glass-half-empty.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The glass is empty, Sheldon. It's completely empty. If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst, he would be dead. Do you know why? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Before I answer, was he a smoker?</p>", "5809": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> We won't know if there's equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.</p>", "5810": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who would you choose?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Robert Downey, Jr.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. I didn't think of Iron Man. You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner, we could meet you two for dessert.</p>", "5811": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I've been struggling for months to come up with a theory for dark matter that doesn't make protons decay. I'm hoping to finally tackle it by optimizing my work environment. See I've got, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature. I have fleece-lined boxer-shorts to keep my tushie toastie. And last but not least, this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade Richard Feynman.</p>", "5812": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, who was he talking to Emily or Cinnamon? \"I want you to know the bed feels so lonely when you're not in it\"?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, I might not be liking this game so much.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Cinnamon. Give me another one.</p>", "5813": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, \"Check it out. I got us matching sweaters.\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We all got the Christmas card. Cinnamon.</p>", "5814": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know a man can care deeply about  a woman and a pet. It's not strange.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ooh, Emily. I heard him say that to Emily.</p>", "5815": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know what, I think it's a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. Maybe the truth is you're jealous of all my relationships.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. Maybe I am. Who wouldn't want to the girl - or possibly dog - to hear the words \"You're so lucky. You have the shiniest hair.\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That is a tough one. I know he brushes both of them.</p>", "5816": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> That was the last one. I promise we won't play it any more.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you. Because if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Emily's feelings?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes, Emily!</p>", "5817": "<p>Emily: So, I hear you guys have been playing a little game.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, we were just kidding around.<br/>\nEmily: Well, you may think it's funny that Raj is sweet and sensitive, but I think it's sexy.<br/>\n*Kisses Raj and pulls a hair out of her mouth*<br/>\nEmily: Urgh, why is there dog hair in your mouth?</p>", "5818": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You know any mining songs?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just the hits.</p>", "5819": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We keep procrastinating. We saw Back to the Future II, pigeons playing ping pong, a bunch of countries that look like genitals, and one guy whose genitals look like Denmark!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, sorry for clicking on that.</p>", "5820": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You suck, Wolowitz!<br><strong>Howard:</strong> What's that about?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm heckling you. It's a beloved part of baseball.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He's right. And given that you're probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, I'm sure you do suck.</br></p>", "5821": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, what's going on?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Baseball.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, that's not what I meant when I said go outside and play.</p>", "5822": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money, so I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?<br/>\nMrs. Davis: Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You people are sick.</p>", "5823": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I just think she wants you to do well and she's worried you won't because you were just a stunningly bad waitress.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That is not true.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I told you, they'll be right out.<br/></p>", "5824": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh! You take that back!</p>", "5825": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, please. I am trying to find a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine.</p>", "5826": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, girlfriend. Can I get a what what?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Close enough. I was just calling to see what you were up to tonight. I thought maybe we could head up Color Me Mine, maybe sneak in some Pinot Gris- what evs.</p>", "5827": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, Sherlock Holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus. But I'm sure those cool ranch Doritos are doing the trick.</p>", "5828": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> [President Siebert said] that everybody has to do things they don't want to do. He then gave an example of something he had to do although he didn't want to. And that was look at my stupid face.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's a rude thing to say ... out loud.</p>", "5829": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's an outrage. Honestly, I am tempted to leave the university.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, if you're really serious about that I hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat.</p>", "5830": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Hello, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hi, mom. I have some exciting news.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I'm listening.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Before I tell you, will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> No.</p>", "5831": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You hate the sound of all those keys on his keychain.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Four keys! Who does he think he is? A warden?</p>", "5832": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. It's called reading the room, Amy.</p>", "5833": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare, I've learned not to sweat the small stuff.</p>", "5834": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Forget it, man. It's crap. Just move on to the next thing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's easy for you to say. You used to be famous.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Hey, I just lost a job for you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, I'm sorry. You're famous.</p>", "5835": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What about when you did Anne Frank at that cute little theater?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> It was above a bowling alley.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, but there was ample parking.</br></p>", "5836": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, Penny. Happy Star Wars day!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay.</p>", "5837": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbar's Snack Bar is open for business!</p>", "5838": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I got your back</p>", "5839": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know Klingon.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's true.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, I meant that as a regret.</p>", "5840": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, how about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's good. Why'd you guys stop doing that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You made fun of us. Said it was stupid.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, sounds like me.</p>", "5841": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Got it! There's a live action role playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith park, and re-enacts battles from Lord of the Rings.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, tell me more about this calzone idea.</p>", "5842": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know what, why don't we just ease into this? Let's go for a walk and see if we find a new restaurant.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Any chance this restaurant is near Griffith Park? *Brings out a Lord of the Rings - Gandalf hat*<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.</p>", "5843": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You're a good son. I don't know how you do it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Beach blankets, my friend. It's all about beach blankets.</p>", "5844": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thankfully, Penny and I have a relationship built around honesty.<br/>\n*Amy and Bernadette chuckle*<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What? I don't lie to her.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, we know you don't lie to her.</p>", "5845": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Since you're paying for dinner, I'll let that slide.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Have you ever paid for a meal?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Not with money.</p>", "5846": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Read.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> *Reading fortune cookie* \"Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you.\"<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Nope, try again.</p>", "5847": "<p><strong>Psychic:</strong> Does she have dark hair?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes, yes. Your spirit guides are on fire!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The majority of people have dark hair. Even you at one time.</p>", "5848": "<p><strong>Psychic:</strong> Does she work in a similar field to you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hah, the opposite. I'm a physicist and she's a neurobiologist. My spirit guides can go suck an egg.</p>", "5849": "<p><strong>Psychic:</strong> He should give himself to this relationship. Once he does, all his other pursuits will come into focus.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, you hear that? Amy is the key to your happiness.<br/><strong>Psychic:</strong> Exactly. Personally and professionally. Everything will fall into place once you commit to her.</p>", "5850": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Here we go. Night of a Thousand Corpses.<br><strong>Emily:</strong> Just so you know, I was a nanny for three years, so if you get scared I can totally change your diaper.</br></p>", "5851": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you think he's right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can't be proved?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe. But how great is Game of Thrones?</p>", "5852": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How's your soup?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's all right. They could have filled the bowl a little more.<br/>\n*Raj and Emily start laughing*</p>", "5853": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That was Wil. He's feeling a lot better. Apparently he's twelve down in the TV Guide crossword puzzle.</p>", "5854": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You excited for Texas?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, very much so.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's not everyday you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ohh, who's the real astronaut?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> ... Buzz Aldrin.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, yay!</p>", "5855": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, please. When I first met you, you were incapable of touching another human being. Now you're holding hands, going on dates, you even made out with her on a train.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She told you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Of course she told me. It's the most interesting thing that's ever happened to her in her entire life.</p>", "5856": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'll point out her name's Yvette and that she's a vet. That's hysterical! She'll love it.</p>", "5857": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do not stop refreshing your screens.<br/>\n*The guys all clicks repeatedly*<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, this is not going to be enough coffee.</p>", "5858": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Does he sound like a criminal?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What do you mean?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, did he say things like \"youse guys\" or \"listen here, say\".<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, he's late because he's on his way here from 1940.</p>", "5859": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Raj, when you said you were going to bring a date to watch Penny's thing tonight, I didn't think you meant Stuart.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really? I never for a second thought it'd be anything else.</p>", "5860": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've been studying how to make people laugh. They say comedy is tragedy plus time. *Looks at his watch and gets up* Let's tickle some ribs!</p>", "5861": "<p><strong>Ira Flatow:</strong> This is Science Friday, I'm Ira Flatow. My guest today is responsible for the discovery of the first stable super-heavy element.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you. The university made me come here, I didn't want to. Big fan of the show. </p>", "5862": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> *Discourteously hands Howard a bottle of wine* Here, thank you for having us.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What's the matter with you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, she's mad at me because she just found out she's married to Zack.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really? That dumb ass you used to date? That's hysterical!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I can't believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.</p>", "5863": "<p><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> I've kept my marriage together for 35 years. Can I weigh in here?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> I'm trying to watch the game. Shut up.</p>", "5864": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How are those nipples feeling, chief?</p>", "5865": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, we're almost ready to go. Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes.<br><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  This is so exciting. I feel like I'm seventy-five again.</br></p>", "5866": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> *Imitating Howard* My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everyone love me.</p>", "5867": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, if you're hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye, I can't help you. I have been informed he is now Bill Nye, the Restraining Order Guy.</p>", "5868": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> I was thinking if it isn't too much trouble, I'd like to get your opinion about my paper.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you, it would be an honor.<br/>\n*Professor Proton hands Sheldon his paper*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Actually, I don't need that. I hacked into your email account and read it.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  What did you think?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> First, I think the fact you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Second, I thought your paper was inspired.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  Well that means a lot to me.<br/></p>", "5869": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can I invite you in for tea?<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> No, I really have to run .<br/>\n*Penny walks in the room*<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey Arthur, how are you?<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  Well I guess one cup wouldn't hurt.</p>", "5870": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, Princeton, look at that. Team community college-night school is in the lead!</p>", "5871": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> So, when you guys plan fun activities, does my name even come up or ...?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I invited you to my murder mystery party.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> No, you didn't.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh.</p>", "5872": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Have you got Leonard a welcome home gift?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you want to go halfsies on a $200 squirt gun?</p>", "5873": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> If you like dry, factual statement interspersed with awkward silence, it was bananas.</p>", "5874": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Allow me to comfort you. At least you've got your health.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? That, that's it? That's comforting?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Um, uh, in a hundred years, you'll both be dead and it won't matter?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No. Come on, you're supposed to say, \"Of course he misses you, the only reason he's partying is to cover up his pain.\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no, I don't think that's true at all.</p>", "5875": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because hes off having a good time?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, perhaps you're obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, that- that's great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Actually, I can't. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that I'd take care of you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> He did?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's really sweet.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Plus, if I do a good job, he said he'd bring me back a Sailor's cap.</p>", "5876": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm actually glad Lucy had to work tonight. Saved me the awkward conversation about how I was hanging with my bros.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Isn't every conversation you two have awkward?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Painfully so. We have this rule that if no one talks for three minutes, we can just hang up. So into her.</p>", "5877": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, when we were going through security, I got pulled out of line for a pat-down. The TSA agent got a little handsy. I may have broken her nose with my elbow.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Long story short, she's on the No Fly List and we might have been followed here by a drone.</p>", "5878": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've never knocked on my own door before. That was a wild ride.</p>", "5879": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, I just found out that I have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why don't you put her in a kennel?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why don't you put your mother in a home?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> To be honest, she'd do better in the kennel.</p>", "5880": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Is, uh, is he dangerous?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Actually he's a genius.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> That doesn't answer my question.</br></p>", "5881": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Is the blond girl really your girlfriend?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, sir.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> You're the genius.</p>", "5882": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> When this is all blows over, remember that voice. It's kind of a turn-on.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It turns you on when I sound like Raj?</p>", "5883": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If it hadn't been for you, well, who knows what would've become of me. You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could've wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.</p>", "5884": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll do it.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> He's not a relative. He's not allowed, right?<br/><strong>Paramedic:</strong> No, that's not a rule. He can go.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> I can't catch a break today.</p>", "5885": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this'll be the best day ever.</p>", "5886": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr. <br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Thank you, Sheldon. That, that was very nice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Want me to sing it again?<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> No. The fourth, the fourth time was the charm.</p>", "5887": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Sounds great.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, in a way, it's like I'm your son.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Whatever.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Father.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Sure, what the hell.</p>", "5888": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I broke down and read Lucy's blog. In one of the entries, she said when we first met I struck her as a little feminine.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Just a little? That's great.</p>", "5889": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, it was fun. Kind of reminded me of my high school. But instead of vampires, we had meth heads. But both came out at night and had messed up teeth.</p>", "5890": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies?</p>", "5891": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> My point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Only if you're this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If I could keep my gMail account, I'd be okay with that.</p>", "5892": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I just keep thinking how cool it would be if I called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> She'd be proud, huh?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call.</p>", "5893": "<p><strong>Kripke:</strong> If you need my nose, you'll find it firmly lodged up the rectum of the tenure committee.</p>", "5894": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I have a thick accent. You don't know what I said.</p>", "5895": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Come on. If I was any good at convincing women to do stuff, I wouldn't have spent so much of my 20s in the shower.</p>", "5896": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm cool with surprises, but nothing on the Jumbotron. I don't want to cry on the big screen like that.</p>", "5897": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, you and I have so much fun hanging out together. If you were a girl, all our problems would be solved.<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh yeah, think about it. We'd hang out, read comic books, we'd see movies. It'd be like the best relationship ever.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> That does sound nice.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Then I'd take you home, slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> What?</br></p>", "5898": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I got them on Amazon.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Sure, I get it. Why support a friend when you can support a multinational conglomerate that is crushing the life out of that friend?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know, but when I shop online I can do it on the toilet.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Have you seen my store? The whole place is a toilet.</p>", "5899": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't care for your friend, he's being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, I can't just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He's a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him.</p>", "5900": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wow, Amy's mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day.</p>", "5901": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to have a conversation about girls.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I had a weird feeling we'd have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally fuzz in weird places?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, please. I'm on the horns of a relationship dilemma. And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And for the record, bleugh.</p>", "5902": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> See, the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other, which is baffling because they're both crazy about me. And I like them, which indicates they're bright and interesting and/or were on Star Trek.</p>", "5903": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it. I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfok.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, please. I think I've evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sorry.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> On the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.</p>", "5904": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My friend, Wil Wheaton.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I\u2019m excited to be here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, Wil, what do you have for us first?<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets. Now what's interesting about this flag-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Cut.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> What was wrong with that?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's called Fun with Flags. They're not at half-mast, nobody died. Let's try and keep it upbeat.</p>", "5905": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Problem, first-time director?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, none that I could see. I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do. I got goose bumps.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> He was overacting on purpose.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? He reminded me of a young William Shatner.</p>", "5906": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Fine. Then maybe I should go.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Could you? That would solve everything. You are the best. I'll see you at dinner tonight?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You sure you wouldn't rather have dinner with your friend Wil Wheaton?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Come to think of it, I would! You, little lady, are on fire.</p>", "5907": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, I see what you're getting at. How about this weekend I'll box up all my things and move them to our place.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The lightsabres are gonna look great in the living room.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Or in the closet. We can decide later.</p>", "5908": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, quite the kerfuffle.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Then Amy got mad and left?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Walked right out the door.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yogurt machine. Right next to it. I was closer to it than I am to you right now.</p>", "5909": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why's that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're just repeating what I said. It's like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Trust me, call her.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. It's a shame you didn't go to dinner with us, because the buffet you're about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yogurt. I was this close.</p>", "5910": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So, is there anything I can do to help you with the move tomorrow?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What's your excuse this time?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No excuse. It's just, you know, I'm Jewish, and technically, we're not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath. So this one's on God.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That might be a little more convincing if you didn't have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.</br></p>", "5911": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> My religion's kinda loosey-goosey. Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don't wear a cross, you're good.</p>", "5912": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie, you promised you'd move.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And I will.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, right.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I will. I'm obviously not going to live in my mother's house for the rest of my life. I'm not a child.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I've seen her burp you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She did not burp me. She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp.</p>", "5913": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I remember when I was five, hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy. Had some Peanut M&amp;Ms, went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital. Came home, celebrated with a Snickers, went into my second anaphylactic shock.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sometime around the third Almond Joy.</p>", "5914": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So what are you drinking?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, it\u2019s been a rough day. I usually go chamomile tea, but I don't think that's going to cut it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Will that calm my nerves?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's calmed the pants off me a couple of times.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sold.</p>", "5915": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Aw, she'll be okay. She's a grown woman.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I know. It's just ever since my dad left, I've felt responsible for her.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's a lot for a kid to deal with.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She was just so sad all the time. I was the only person who could cheer her up. Well, me and Ben and Jerry.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> She's lucky you were there.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, she's why I first got into magic. I would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. And part way through the act, I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. I can still remember the way she'd smile. For a few minutes, she'd forget how lonely she was.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Aw, crap. Let's go.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Where we going?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Grab a box. We'll sleep at your mother's place tonight.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, but I want to live here.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, you should've thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story.</p>", "5916": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Hey, Sheldon, what's up?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wouldn't you like to know?<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Have you been drinking?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just tea. S'the best tea I've ever had.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Why are you here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll tell you. I'm from Texas. Need I say more?<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Yeah, actually, a little more would be helpful.</p>", "5917": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You insulted my woman. I'm here to defend her honor. Two! It was two. *Knock, knock, knock* Wil Wheaton! Now prepare yourself for what may come.</p>", "5918": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Okay, I'm sorry.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that was a long bus ride for not very much.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Are you okay?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're asking a lot of questions, Wil Wheaton. As a matter of idle curiosity, which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting? Never mind, I'll choose. (Vomits) You were so good in Stand by Me.</p>", "5919": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know what she's talking about, but I'm obligated to agree with her. She's my girlfriend.<br/><strong>LeVar Burton:</strong> Ah, I hear you, brother. I still get lunch, right?</p>", "5920": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> There are certain things that say to the world, I have a boyfriend and he's not made up. Matching cotumes, hickeys and sex tapes. Pick one.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's a hickey?</p>", "5921": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> So, Howard's really in space, huh?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mmm-hmm. International Space Station. 250 miles that way.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Right now, Howard's staring down at our planet like a tiny Jewish Greek god. Zeusowitz.</p>", "5922": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Waiter? A bottle of champagne and three glasses. Oh boy, isn't this romantic?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I hope that's a rhetorical question, because I have no clue.</p>", "5923": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way, you'd be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert. Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven. As a fungus, I have a terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. And no thank you, expensive concessions. Because as an algae, I'll just snack on this sunlight.</p>", "5924": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Here.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What is this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're upset. The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, but what is it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Chicken broth. It seemed culturally appropriate. Also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in and it's been bothering me for the last eight years. So, as they say, two birds.</p>", "5925": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello Leonard, do you like my bongos?</p>", "5926": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It was a nice retirement party.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> I guess. Still, it's a shame Professor Rothman was forced to step down.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What choice did the university have? He snapped. It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I wonder how long Sheldon's got.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> These shrimp are all the same size. There's no the logical order to eat them in. (throws shrimp in the trash)<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Cant be very long.</br></p>", "5927": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Ignore him, President Siebert. I'm sure a young man such as yourself has a perfectly healthy prostate.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, he's just trying to butter you up. And for the record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam.</p>", "5928": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Anyway, you want to make out?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I thought because our relationship was in a beta test, you wanted to take things slow?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay. Do you want to make out slow?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can go so slow. It'll be like there's a snail in your mouth.</p>", "5929": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I have to get a lock for my door.</p>", "5930": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Where?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The gas station across the street.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In your pajamas?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Without shoes?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> On a cold winter's night?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Seems unlikely. Did you bring your asthma inhaler?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, uh, uh. Yes, I did!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, then, I guess it's plausible.</p>", "5931": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> See that? I just saved us forty bucks.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've long said what you lack in academic knowledge, you make up for in street smarts.</p>", "5932": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Tell her I have a deep sexy voice like James Earl Jones.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She doesn't know what James Earl Jones sounds like.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Great. Then she won't know I'm lying.</p>", "5933": "<p>Mrs. <strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Frankly, after all your sleepovers with the little brown boy, a girl is a big relief!</p>", "5934": "<p><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> You have to wonder about grown men who play with toy trains.</p>", "5935": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> How was the wedding?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Come in, let's talk. Do you want a glass of wine?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Wine is one of the reasons I'm in this fix. That and this dang pelvis.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, I'm sorry, what exactly happened?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> The inevitable. He was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let's face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore.</p>", "5936": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I miss the days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.</p>", "5937": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, if you don't, you're gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How can you be so racist?\n<strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, come on, tell me I'm wrong.</p>", "5938": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, good. Um, can I tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Cool. Can I say it fell apart because you were all, I want to have your babies, and I was like, Im too rock and roll to be tied down?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Can I say I ruined you for white men?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Also no.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, just the candle thing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah.</p>", "5939": "<p>Priya: You have such beautiful eyes. Have you ever thought about getting contacts?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I tried in the seventh grade. I could never get used to them.<br/>\nPriya: Oh, that's too bad.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case.</p>", "5940": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, look at Leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes. Way to go, Priya. For once, he doesn't look like a mannequin in the boys' department.</p>", "5941": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out of the Kama Sutra, was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?<br><strong>Priya:</strong> Yeah, just because you're in bed with an Indian woman, you think that gives you permission to use crazy positions from an ancient Indian love manual?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, if you can find a book called Weird Sex with White Boys, I'd be okay with that.</br></p>", "5942": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Go ahead, Zach. Naked drunk girl, free balling. Continue.</p>", "5943": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, you know what? Let's just try a different improv. Uh, oh, this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, and we're going to use props?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You bet. I had dreams, you know. I was gonna be famous. Show everybody back home I could be someone. Now look at me. Want some?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You have any frozen yogurt?</p>", "5944": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> (On the phone) Mrs. Cooper, hey, it's Penny. Yeah, I think I broke your son. Hey, hold on. Talk to your mother.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mommy, I love you. Don't let Spock take me to the future!</p>", "5945": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I trust Penny will adhere to the Official California Restaurant Workers Solemn Oath of Ethics and Cleanliness.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't believe there's any such thing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (To Leonard) You lied to me?</p>", "5946": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thanks for the steak, Wyatt.<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> My pleasure. Its nice to have dinner with a boyfriend of Pennys that knows how to use a napkin.</p>", "5947": "<p><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Let me tell you about this one genius she was going out with. This, this fella Donnie.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, will you please let it go?<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Donnie was gonna make millions turning farm waste into bio-fuel and selling it to the government.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> A lot of people are doing that.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, see?<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Yeah, but all Donnie did was mix pig poop with a little water and pump it into his mom's Camry.</p>", "5948": "<p><strong>Wyatt:</strong> And Donnie was a rocket scientist compared to that boy who wanted to get beer pong into the Olympics. What was his name, sweetheart?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Curtis, and I'm pretty sure he was joking.<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> I don't know. That petition looked real to me.</p>", "5949": "<p><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Now I'm going to do something here to help you along.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Excuse me?<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Just don't panic. (yelling) Now, get your sorry, lying ass out of my face and make sure I never see it again!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, the reverse psychology thing. I see. That's very clever.<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Don't yap. Just get out.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'll friend you on Facebook!</p>", "5950": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, Sheldon, you don't have to do this because Leonard and I are not- <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you sure you want to include him in this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Include me in what? Is there a plot afoot? I'll have no truck with plots.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, you're right. No, there's no plots, no trucks, no feet.</p>", "5951": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> He's got the movie. Get him!</p>", "5952": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'd like to offer a laudatory statement about Howard's many excellent qualities that I believe will tip the scales back in his favor. Howard Joewl Wolowitz. H is for honesty, of which he has much. O's for outstanding, which he is such. W's for witty, he's quick with a joke. A's for artistic, his ability-<br/><strong>Agent Page:</strong> I'm sorry, Dr. Cooper, this matter is already closed.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I still have rd Joel Wolowitz to go.</p>", "5953": "<p><strong>Althea:</strong> My, my, my. What do we have here?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I slipped and fell.<br/><strong>Althea:</strong> Yeah, we get that a lot.</p>", "5954": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know what? It's none of my business. If you want to sleep with Sheldon's doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, now...<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me. I'm uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton, who I assure you has better things to do.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm not recommending it. I'm saying it already happened.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's preposterous. Tell her, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well...<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on. It wasn't my fault.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?</p>", "5955": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Hey, Sheldon. I just wanted you to know I'm really looking forward to wiping the floor with you.</p>", "5956": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, I just wanted to tell you I'm a big fan.<br>\nWil: Oh, thanks.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm sure you're probably sick of Star Trek questions, but, Whoopi Goldberg, you ever hit that?</br></p>", "5957": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So what did you end up doing?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Not much. Nuked a burrito. Prayed to the Hindu God Urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.</p>", "5958": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, the more I think about it, the mobster sauce couldn't possibly contain chunks of mobster.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And why is that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It was listed under seafood.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?</p>", "5959": "<p><strong>Abby:</strong> Hey that's pretty cool, what is it? <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's a limited edition Green Lantern  lantern. My friend is looking for someone to copulate with. <br/><strong>Abby:</strong> You're very funny. I'm Abby. </p>", "5960": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Have you chosen one to copulate with? </p>", "5961": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got on to the subject of you is baffling.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Yes, but we are on the subject, so I'm obliged to ask: Leonard, how are you?</p>", "5962": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> She's a remarkable girl. The youngest appeals court judge in New Jersey and a two-time Olympic gold medallist.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You must be very happy.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Why? I'm not marrying her.</p>", "5963": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I was thinking of closing early and going home, but let's face it, that's just a slightly smaller lonely room filled with comics.</p>", "5964": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Professor, can you identify our cricket?\n<br/><strong>Crawley:</strong> Of course I can. I can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet. Not that that's gonna keep me from having to move in with my daughter in Oxnard, and we're not talking Oxnard at the beach, No! We're talking Oxnard in the onion fields.</p>", "5965": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My credibility may have been damaged.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Completely wrecked.</p>", "5966": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm a theoretical physicist, a career I chose in no small part because it's indoors. But if I'm able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the first scientist to confirm string theory. People will write books about me. Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death.</p>", "5967": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I'm sure the new people will be just as quiet.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You can't know that. How can you possibly know that?\n<strong>Penny:</strong> You know what? Anyone could rent that apartment now. An opera singer, the cast of Stomp, a tap dancing pirate with a wooden leg.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why are you making it worse?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I tried making it better, he wouldn't go for it.</p>", "5968": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You fail to take into account that even mute, I am foreign and exotic. While you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty.</p>", "5969": "<p>Mrs. <strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Okay then, you kids have fun. Use protection!</p>", "5970": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What was he like when he was young?<br><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> You'll have to be more specific.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, like five or six.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> *looks at Penny*<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Five.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oh. Well, at that age he was well enmeshed in what Freud would call the phallic stage of pyscho-sexual development. An outmoded theory, of course, but the boy did spend most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis.</br></p>", "5971": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> (To David) Usually the physicists I know are indoors-y and pale.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm not indoors-y. I just wear the appropriate sun block because I don't take melanoma lightly.</p>", "5972": "<p><strong>DMV Worker:</strong> Application?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm actually more of a theorist.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The application in your hand, give it to her.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh.</br></p>", "5973": "<p><strong>Leslie:</strong> Hey, dummy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Ooh, rush me to the burn unit.</p>", "5974": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What happens in costume at comic-con stays at comic-com.\n<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're only saying that because of what happened to you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What happened to you?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Nothing happened to me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It wasn't your fault, Raj, he was dressed like a green Orion slave girl.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How did we get on me, we were mocking Leonard for not moving on, dude, you have totally not moved on.</p>", "5975": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must know-<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Smart? I'd have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.</br></p>", "5976": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I want to talk to you.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What would we talk about? We've no overlapping areas of interest I'm aware of,. and you know I don't care for chit-chat.</br></p>", "5977": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Here you go, Copenhagen boy, how about a taste of Hans Christian Hand Grenade.</p>", "5978": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, I know, I still can't afford it.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Why don't we share it? We'll each put in two hundred bucks and we'll take turns having it in our homes.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> A time share time machine? I'm in.</br></br></p>", "5979": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> If my fingers ever work again, I've got a job for the middle one.</p>", "5980": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Damn, okay, Ill just take the roof.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke. It's not ... never mind.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For what it's worth, I thought it was humorous.</p>", "5981": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, I've got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!</p>", "5982": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That sounds fair.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Twice a month.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Then no.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, every other month.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No.</p>", "5983": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Now, out of the way so I can sit in my time machine. Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10th, 1876.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait a minute. I want to see that too.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So when it's your turn, you can.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But if we all go back to the same point in time, Bell's lab is going to get very crowded. He'll know something's up.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Also, since the time machine doesn't move in space, you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And even if you can make it to Boston, what are you going to do? Knock on the door and say to Mrs. Bell, \"Hey, Mrs. Bell, big fan of your husband, can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Mrs. Bell was deaf. Shes not even going to hear you knock.</p>", "5984": "<p><strong>Dr. Gablehauser:</strong> I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around, let him see why we're the best physics research facility in the country.<br/><strong>Dennis Kim:</strong> I already know you're not. You don't have an open science grid computer, or a free electron laser, and the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end.<br/><strong>Dennis Kim:</strong> Well, obviously you don't see it yet, but trust me, you will.</p>", "5985": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What the hell do you mean, dead end?<br><strong>Dennis Kim:</strong> I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory could be as large as ten to the five-hundredth power. In addition ... ooh, look, chocolate milk.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I sense a disturbance in the force.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (Imitating Yoda) A bad feeling I have about this, mmm-hmmm.</br></p>", "5986": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Alright, and this is my office.<br/><strong>Dennis Kim:</strong> Is this part of the tour?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nope. Goodbye.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, Sheldon, we've hardly shown him anything.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, alright. This is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye.</p>", "5987": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, Dennis, I'll show you the rec centre, they've got nautilus equipment.<br/><strong>Dennis Kim:</strong> Do I look like I lift weights?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not heavy ones.</p>", "5988": "<p><strong>Dennis Kim:</strong> It's startling to me you haven't considered a Lorentz invariant field theory approach.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You think I haven't considered it? You really think I haven't considered it?<br/><strong>Dennis Kim:</strong> Have you considered it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Get him out Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, Dennis, I'll show you the radiation lab.<br/><strong>Dennis Kim:</strong> Wow, you won the Stephenson award.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it.<br/><strong>Dennis Kim:</strong> Really, how old?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fourteen and a half.<br/><strong>Dennis Kim:</strong> You <em>were</em> the youngest person ever to win it.</p>", "5989": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn't it?</p>", "5990": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just eat, Sheldon, you'll feel better.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why waste food? In Texas when a cow goes dry they don't keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk?</p>", "5991": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You can't let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg.</p>", "5992": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, you've got a bit of competition, I really don't see what the big deal is.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well of course you don't, you've never excelled at anything.</p>", "5993": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I've never really paid attention.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, well, right now I'm designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don't need any help.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, sure you do. Now, see, what's this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now, hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It would blow up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you sure?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Pretty sure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Pretty sure's not very scientific. Is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?</p>", "5994": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, Howard. You're a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it?</p>", "5995": "<p><strong>Dr. Gablehauser:</strong> Mr Kim was not only the valedictorian at Stamford University, he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious Stephenson Award.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!</p>", "5996": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How was Nebraska?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, better than North Dakota! I guess that joke's only funny in Nebraska.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> From the data at hand you really can't draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Boy, it's good to be back.</p>", "5997": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, relax, she doesn't have any symptoms, I'm sure she's not contagious.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose.</p>", "5998": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What the hell are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm making petri dishes to grow throat cultures.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> With lime jello?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yogurt. Here, swab my throat.</p>", "5999": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> It was Sheldon.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I tried to stop you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's my own fault. I forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of '06.</p>", "6000": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, what are you doing here?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sick, thank you very much.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> How could you have gotten it from me? I'm not sick.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're a carrier. All these people here are doomed. You're doomed!</br></p>", "6001": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, what kind of soup do you want?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made cro\u00fbtons.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made cro\u00fbtons?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Then surprise me.</p>", "6002": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven't you ever been sick before?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, of course, but, not by myself.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really, never?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Studying abroad?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I'm used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia.</p>", "6003": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> And there was no-one there to take care of you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. No, my mum had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinder blocks again.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Again?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It was tornado season. And it was an aluminum house.</p>", "6004": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Unless Sheldon's there, in which case you'll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web.</p>", "6005": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Alright, you're close enough to Sheldon's room, deploy the sensor. Now turn it on.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It wasn't on?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Then why did I have to crawl?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, I guess you didn't.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, it's on.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Good. From this point forward you will have to crawl.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know!</p>", "6006": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't think Penny\u2019s ever coming here again.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm very congested.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, so?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey baster labeled mucus.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If I stand, I'll vomit.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl.</p>", "6007": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Wait a minute, Farminfarmian is speaking and you're bogarting the symposium?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Howard, I'm sorry. We're-<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, no. You're quark-blocking us.</p>", "6008": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, why don't you tell me about your showcase last night?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, it was okay, I guess. Wasn't a big turnout, but they both really seemed to like it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> There were only two people there?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> By the end, yeah.</p>", "6009": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Alright, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent, but I didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have a conclusion based on an observation.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, you don't. No he doesn't.</p>", "6010": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle. You're in no state to talk.</p>", "6011": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Remember how Leonard told you we couldn't come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I remember symposium.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, well, he lied.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, what?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He lied, and I'm feeling very uncomfortable about it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well imagine how I'm feeling.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hungry? Tired? I'm sorry this really isn't my strong suit.</p>", "6012": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You told her I lied? Why would you tell her I lied?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> To help you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I'm getting a bad feeling.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hunger? Indigestion? I'm sorry. I'm really not very good at this.</p>", "6013": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay. Why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousin?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah, because it's in Long Beach, and I don't drive.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We're going to Long Beach?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, of course not. Theres no cousin Leo, theres no intervention. Focus, Leonard.</p>", "6014": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Thanks. I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, well, thank you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that's not who you are. You are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when ... when he has a symposium to go to.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know what to say.</p>", "6015": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. We're going with middle child and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.<br><strong>Toby:</strong> Swell, how do I play genetic predisposition?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sub-textually, of course.</br></p>", "6016": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hi. How did the intervention go?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Unfortunately, we weren't able to convince him to go to rehab.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, based on what you told me, I'm not surprised.</p>", "6017": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sounds good.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I have a video of me singing last night. Do you want to see it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Gee, why wouldn't I?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> This is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now I get to watch you watch me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. Funny how things work out.</p>", "6018": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, in the future, when we're disembodied brains in jars, we're going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't want to be in a jar. I want my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall and ripped.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm with you. I just have to make sure if I'm a synthetic human I'd still be Jewish. I promised my mother.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But that's something your Rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not to mention you'd have to power down on Saturdays.</p>", "6019": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, we have to do this.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No we don't. We have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying. Everything else is optional.</p>", "6020": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, let me put it this way, I'm doing it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You can't. I'm the lead author.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, come on. The only reason you're the lead author is because we went alphabetically.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I was throwing you a bone. You're welcome.</p>", "6021": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It doesn't need proving.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They're not supposed to, but they should.</p>", "6022": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Here, why don't you put these on while I find a shirt and sport-coat to match.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Great, be right back.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, where you going, just put them on.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Here?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, are you shy?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I'm not shy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Don't worry, I won't look.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know you won't look. Why would you look. There's nothing to see. Well, not nothing...<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sweetie, put the pants on.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Putting them on.</p>", "6023": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So you and Leonard-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh dear God.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Little misunderstanding, huh?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A little misunder- Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.</p>", "6024": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don't need validation from lesser minds. No offense.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really, so why did you come?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because I knew you\u2019d screw this up.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I didn't screw it up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, please. I admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there.</p>", "6025": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio funk?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> A shower.</p>", "6026": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'll take the heart smart platter.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Alright, thank you, and Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We don't eat here. I don't know what's good.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, it's all good.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Statistically unlikely.</p>", "6027": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh dear.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What's the matter?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> She didn't take my order.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> How can she take your order when you're too neurotic to talk to her?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip.</p>", "6028": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What did Penny mean, you'd make a cute couple?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Leslie made Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb, aren't they adorable.</p>", "6029": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn't want to be disturbed because they\u2019re, you know, getting busy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams.</p>", "6030": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know what, I'm being ridiculous. Who cares what Penny thinks? Leslie is a terrific girl. She's attractive, we like each other, she's extremely intelligent.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She's not that intelligent.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She fixed your equation.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She got lucky.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You don't believe in luck.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't have to believe in it for her to be lucky.</br></p>", "6031": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Alright, just a few more feet, and ... here we are gentlemen, the Gates of Elzebob.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good lord!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oooh.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't panic, this is what the last 97 hours have been about.</p>", "6032": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Stay frosty, there's a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the Sword of Azeroth.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Lock and load.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Raj, blow up the gates.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Blowing the gates. Control, shift, B! Oh, my God, so many goblins!</p>", "6033": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I just, I got your mail again, here.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thank you. I've got to talk to that mailman.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh no, that's probably not such a good idea. Civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap.</p>", "6034": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signaling sexual availability.</p>", "6035": "<p><strong>Leslie Winkle:</strong> What do you think?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You proposed the experiment, I think you should present your findings first.<br/><strong>Leslie Winkle:</strong> Fair enough. On the plus side, it was a good kiss, reasonable technique, no extraneous spittle. On the other hand, no arousal.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> None?<br/><strong>Leslie Winkle:</strong> None.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ah. Well, thank you for your time.<br/><strong>Leslie Winkle:</strong> Thank you.</p>", "6036": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> God, that's a good song.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide.</p>", "6037": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know what you're thinking. I've taken your asthma into account. There's a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, listen to me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I've been thinking about names. I'm kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots.</p>", "6038": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Great. Did we say a time?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Six thirty.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And that's still good for you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's fine.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Cos it's not carved in stone.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, six thirtys great.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'll get my chisel.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> To ... carve the ... okay, I'll see you six thirty.</p>", "6039": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What time is your date?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Six thirty.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is it too much?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not if you're a rugby team.</p>", "6040": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course, there's the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You could have stopped at \"it could go well.\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If I could've, I would've.</p>", "6041": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> If I could calm down I wouldn't be having a panic attack, that's why they call it a panic attack.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, all right. Well, just sit down. Yes, sit down, now close your eyes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just do it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's a bio-feedback technique. It's relaxation through brain-wave manipulation. I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience. It was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid. I probably have it here somewhere.</p>", "6042": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn't quite bounced back yet.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're kidding. Well, then, that's something we have in common.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> How?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We both have people in our lives who ... want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.</p>", "6043": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, well, you know, it's just me. I'm still getting over this break-up with Kurt, and this thing with Doug would be just rebound sex.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ugh, don't get me started on rebound sex.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's just, it's my pattern. I break up, then I find some cute guy, and then it's just thirty six meaningless of ... well, you know.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm not sure that I do. Um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, one ... glorious summer.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, it's usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, chafing, right?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Emotionally.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Of course, yeah, emotional chafing.</p>", "6044": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Are there any chopsticks?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You don't need chopsticks, this is Thai food.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Here we go.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they don't actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ask him for a napkin, I dare you.</p>", "6045": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman's flight is a feat of strength.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman's flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earth's yellow Sun.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, and you don't have a problem with that? How does he fly at night?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, a combination of the moon's solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.</br></p>", "6046": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Great Caesar's Ghost, look at this place!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So Penny's a little messy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos.</p>", "6047": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbor's apartment and clean.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sarcasm?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You think?</p>", "6048": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh boy, I was afraid of this.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.</p>", "6049": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Maybe if I turn off the nightlight, I can keep the sheets.</p>", "6050": "<p><strong>Doug:</strong> What's up, bro?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, nothing much... Bro!</p>", "6051": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh oh, hypothetical aftershock. (Sheldon grabs Leonard and pushes him over) And that's why we wear hard-hats.</p>", "6052": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Playing Boggle) Oh, worf. Nice. Too bad that's a proper noun.</p>", "6053": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Aw man, if I'd started this years ago I'd be divorced two or three times by now.</p>", "6054": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> He's mad at you, too. He says you're the succubus who led his friend astray.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't know what succubus is, but it has \"suck\" in it so that can't be good.</br></p>", "6055": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Bet you didn't know that I play bongos.</p>", "6056": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong>(typing) Hit troll with axe! Hit troll with axe! Hit troll with axe! Oh, my, this is one tough troll.</p>", "6057": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I can't believe you were testing me against a chimp.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me, Amy was testing you. I was rooting for you. Good job on that banana box, by the way.</p>", "6058": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why would you do that? You're a string theorist as well.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Incorrect. I'm a string pragmatist. I say I'm going to prove something that can not be proved. I apply for grant money and then I spend it on liquor and broads.</p>", "6059": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I must say, I go back and fourth between this whole boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running</p>", "6060": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. It is time to cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war.</p>", "6061": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The year was 1995, the place, Jackson, Mississippi, having spent 10 hours on a bus, during which I had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself onboard a moving vehicle, I finally arrived at the 4th annual Dixie Trek Convention only to find that my idol, Wil Wheaton, decided he had better things to do than show up and sign my action figure.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong>  What?!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton, now I have my revenge.</p>", "6062": "<p><strong>Stephen Hawking:</strong> Are you sitting in a bathroom?\n<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. I needed a place to storm off to and it was all that was available.\n<br><strong>Stephen Hawking:</strong> Fine. But if I hear a flush, this conversation is over.\n</br></br></p>", "6063": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> All right, I'm not saying it's true, but let's consider for a moment that possibly I'm the problem.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You are.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You can say it.</br></p>", "6064": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You know who would be the perfect roommate?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Gandalf, but he's a smoker.</p>", "6065": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You couldn't sleep either?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Of course not.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Me neither. But I just had a tickle in my throat. Not profound marital problems.</p>", "6066": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I know what you're going through. My last break-up was pretty tough.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, what was her name?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hey, it's a true story. I don't need the third degree.</p>", "6067": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, look. Instead of fighting, why don't we dim the lights, get naked and make a baby?<br/><br/>\nWas trying to lighten the mood. It's not easy. You try it.</p>", "6068": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You really went your entire life without anyone saying I hate you to your face?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'd say it now, but look at those cheekbones.</p>", "6069": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. Moving on.</p>", "6070": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello. I didn't expect you this evening.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night. I wanted to make it up to you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And how do you propose to do that?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> *Opens coat to reveal school uniform*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Unless you have Gravity on Blu-ray under that skirt, I don't know where you're going with this.</p>", "6071": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, okay. Good, good. So it's cool if I cry a little?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I probably wouldn't.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah ... *wipes tears from his right eye*.</p>", "6072": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm so proud of you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> They haven't even got to my scene yet.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know, but you're going to be a TV star and you haven't left me yet. That takes guts!</p>", "6073": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> (on the phone) Yes, how much for 100 long-stem red roses? Really? How much for three?</p>", "6074": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If my apples are mealy, we can hit the supermarket for one last blowout. I'll even let you push the trolley.</p>", "6075": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This (Sailor's Hat) changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I'm wearing this year. Amy, you're going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the donuts.</p>", "6076": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I was going to spend the night with my special little lady, but she got worms and I had to take her to the vet.</p>", "6077": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't think she's a whore.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh no, she's definitely a whore. She has no standards. ... Wait, where's Howard?<br/>\n*Off screen:*<br/><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Bonjour, mademoiselle. I understand you're new in town.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, good God!</br></p>", "6078": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> We are from the Lollipop guild and we want you!</p>", "6079": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It doesn't matter. They'll find a way to give me a one-way ticket back to Ghandiville. And by the way, when I say that it's not offensive.</p>", "6080": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz liquid-waste-disposal system is turning a few heads as well.<br/><strong>Ramona:</strong> Again, ew.</p>", "6081": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> This is our year, with those guys out, the entire Physics Bowl will kneel before Zod.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Zod?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Kryptonian villain, long story.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Good story. (Covers  his mouth upon realizing he spoke to Penny sober)</p>", "6082": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's a waste of time. I might as well explain thermodynamics to a bunch of Labradoodles.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If you don't do this, I won't take you to the comic book store.</p>", "6083": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, you-you just have to be patient.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But what if while I'm being patient, someone more relentless than me badgers their university into giving them money?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> If there's someone more relentless than you, I'd like to meet them.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> I would not.</br></br></br></p>", "6084": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> There is a lot of room between \"don't like\" and \"hate.\" You know, it's-it's where you find rice pudding and jazz.</p>", "6085": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, Amy, I don't know what to say. I think I got stuck on the fact that it's not a dress I would choose, but it shouldn't be. You know, it's your dress. I mean, hey, would you marry Leonard?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Ew.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, a simple \"no\" would have been fine, but you see my point.</br></br></p>", "6086": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Why do you smell like smoke?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was in Vegas.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Vegas?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry. Las Vegas.</br></p>", "6087": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Isn't Halley's birthday the same as Amy's?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, but we're not doing anything big 'cause she's one, Bernadette's on bed rest, and (clears throat) I'm lazy.</p>", "6088": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know you have a lot on your mind, but when do you think we'll have an answer on those cake flowers?</p>", "6089": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What you reading?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, it's your brother's Christmas letter.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ugh. If there's a picture of his wife and his kids and his dogs and his horses all in matching pajamas, I beg you to burn it.</p>", "6090": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Aw, the people's pajamas have little horses on them, and the horses' have little people.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's just his chance to brag about how great his life is.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, come on, it's nice. You know that nonprofit he works with? They built a hospital in Rwanda.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (mocking tone) Look at me. I built a hospital in Rwanda.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That is a good point. I hadn't thought of it that way.</br></p>", "6091": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's for her surprise frontier birthday dinner. I am making hardtack, boiled salt pork, and because it's a special day, a chewable gob of tree sap.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Is that good?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, compared to other foods, no. Compared to other parts of a tree? Eh.</p>", "6092": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, Stuart, you're coming to Halley's party, right?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> You bet. Plus, I live there and I was invited, so it's already better than my tenth birthday party.</p>", "6093": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now, would you care to join me for an authentic frontier dinner made entirely from scratch?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I can't believe you did this. It's amazing!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, it's not a big deal. Just to be clear, it was a big deal. I was being modest. You got that, right?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Loud and clear.</p>", "6094": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'd really like to be there.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Great, 'cause it's tomorrow, and I need you to plan it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Stuart was gonna help, but the free clinic had an open spot for a colonoscopy, and he jumped on it.</p>", "6095": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> No, I-I'm serious. Do you think there was something wrong with that food?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Frontier scallops? I shouldn't think so.</p>", "6096": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> My stomach's feeling a little weird.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah. Uh, mine, too. I'm sure it's just the first sharp cramps of arousal.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No. Th-This doesn't feel right.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, hey, save that sexy talk for the bedroom.</p>", "6097": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> \"Kept Fern alive\"? Who's Fern?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, the fern. The one in the bathroom.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We're really calling that brown thing alive? Okay.</p>", "6098": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Halley's awake and ready for her party!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Be right up!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, I want to see the birthday girl.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'd love to see her.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Walk slow. It takes a while to get this bra back on.</p>", "6099": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> This was a good idea. It's been a long time since we've had girls' night.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yeah, it's so nice to have a relaxing evening at home doing nothing.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, really breaks up the other 30 days I've spent on bed rest doing nothing.</p>", "6100": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, what's going on? You got a date?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I, uh, do have a date with science.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, what's science wearing?</p>", "6101": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I just want to make a good first impression, and thought maybe you could help me pick out an outfit?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Of course. Let's see what you got.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yeah, you just need to pick something that-that you feel confident in.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm sorry. I left my magic clothes at home.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm sure these two options will be f- So you-you have other clothes at home?</p>", "6102": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, good. Raj is here to tell us today's specials.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Very funny. I have my interview this afternoon.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. If it doesn't work out, you're ready to go on your Mormon mission.</p>", "6103": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't understand what's going on here.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, what's going on here is I'm up for a job at the planetarium, and Howard is making fun of me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that's great. You're both doing what you love.</p>", "6104": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Don't make excuses. What kind of friend acts that way?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I-I guess-<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> It was a rhetorical question. A bad friend!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Come on, Dad! That's just our relationship, okay? He makes Indian jokes, and I laugh, but, you know, with angry eyes so he knows it's not okay.</p>", "6105": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Thanks for your input, but this is my decision, and I'm gonna go with Old English calligraphy on Egyptian papyrus.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, what a fun mashup. It's like the chicken and waffles of orthography.</br></p>", "6106": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, my dad thinks it's because Howard's always making fun of me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, that makes sense.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, what do you mean, that makes sense?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, Howard does make fun of him a lot.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, that's not all Howard's fault. I mean, if Raj doesn't want to be made fun of, then- I, hmm. I don't know a nice way to finish this sentence.</p>", "6107": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, so you're on his side?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm just saying, that's what friends do. You know, they bust on each other. It doesn't mean anything.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I'm not surprised you think so.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why is that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, you can be kind of mean to me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, that's because you're- Wow. I don't know how to finish that sentence, either.</p>", "6108": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> One of us should go sit with Raj so he's not alone.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I'm not done telling you about my wedding revenge plans.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're right. Go on.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, well, first, I'm going to try to get Amy to trade with me for hors d'oeuvres - (Leonard gets up and moves to Raj's table)</p>", "6109": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey. You look good today.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What happened? What's wrong? Just tell me. I can take it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Nothing. I felt bad about being mean to you, so I'm being nice.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, okay. Sorry. I wasn't ready for it. Try again.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You look handsome.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Nope, still freaking me out.</p>", "6110": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, I was on my way to tell Howard, and then I remembered I wasn't speaking to him, so I came over here.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mm, don't you think it's time you two made up?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No. No, actually. I don't need his negative energy in my life right now. Standing up to him was-was hard, but it made me realize that I can do anything. And, yeah, it's a little sad, but, you know, life is all about-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (cork pops) Uh, sorry. I thought you were wrapping things up.</p>", "6111": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe I'll just hang out here for a while.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Great. And you can make fun of me all you want.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, that's okay.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> No, no, no. Go on. I can take it. My feelings, like my extremities, are basically numb.</p>", "6112": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Do we know if there's life in the methane plumes of Enceladus or under the icy surface of Europa? Come back on Tuesday for my next show to find out. Spoiler alert: we don't.</p>", "6113": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow. I never knew science could be so interesting.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, I talk to you about science all the time.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (baby talk) Oh, you sure do, sweetie.</p>", "6114": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Raj, you were terrific!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, thank you. I was so nervous, my armpits are like a swamp.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, your hug just got downgraded to a high five. (chuckles) Your palms are sweaty, too.</p>", "6115": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I love the observatory. They tell you your weight on all the different planets. Yeah, it's always bikini season on Venus.</p>", "6116": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, we-we definitely mined some. I-I remember sitting in your bedroom and writing the program.<br/>\nI think we ended up with a bunch of it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wow, and at, like, $5,000 apiece, that's-<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Sounds like a lot of money, which we agreed to share 'cause I-I was totally there. I remember now.</p>", "6117": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Before we begin, this may have some unprecedented tax implications. In fact, we should start early 'cause we are gonna be on the phone with the IRS for hours. (gasps) Did anybody else just get goose bumps? <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Great, so just the three of us.</p>", "6118": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, please.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Should I be the bigger man?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I think you should.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (snorts) Oh, why'd I ask you?</p>", "6119": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, sweetie.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Everybody good?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sure.<br/>\n(Raj whispers to Howard)<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You don't have to whisper, you can just nod your head.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Or you could just speak.<br/>\n(Raj shakes his head)</p>", "6120": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> So good to see you guys. Man, we should do this more often.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Come over to get laptops back from you?<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Totally.</br></p>", "6121": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Are you guys fighting?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Are you fighting about whether or not you're fighting? 'Cause I've had that fight before. Turns out we were, and I lost.</p>", "6122": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> No, no, no. I am alone. I'm just telling Leonard why I broke up with him.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, he knows. The video I want to see is why you went out with him in the first place.</p>", "6123": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, what do I do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Try to pass out facedown, so you don't choke on your vomit.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I am not gonna pass out. But thank you anyway.</p>", "6124": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aw, you love me so much.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I married you, jackass.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I I know, and not just out of pity like everyone said in their wedding toast.</p>", "6125": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, when we sell the Bitcoin, are you gonna pay your dad back all the money you took from him over the years?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Never even crossed my mind.</p>", "6126": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that is unfortunate. I guess we've all learned a lesson today.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What was the lesson?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know.</p>", "6127": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's fine. I couldn't tell you even if I wanted to.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What does that mean?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard! Sad face, sad face.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I mean, I would like to, but I just can't, you know, because it's classified and top secret.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hold on, are you still working for the military?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm so glad you figured that out! It was killing me keeping it a secret.</p>", "6128": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong>  I thought they fired you guys.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They did, but then they hired me back.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, you better not be working on our project, because we're a team.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, there is no \"I\" in team. However, there is an \"I\" in \"I'm working with the military and you're not.\" There's five of them, in fact.</p>", "6129": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That bitch.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, come on, he means well. He's just trying to impress his girlfriend.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm talking about Ruchi. She's after my job. Why do you think she said, \"Take all the time you need\"?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Because she was being nice?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, she's trying to steal my projects while I'm at home taking care of this useless plant and my dumb family.</p>", "6130": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Is he working on our guidance system or not?<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Dr. Cooper contacted us with an idea on how to modify your technology into a communication system, and it seemed interesting.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But our team developed that technology.<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> And he was your team leader.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, who said he was team leader?<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> He did. And I like that kind of \"take charge\" attitude.</p>", "6131": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I need you to find out if Ruchi's trying to steal my projects at work while I'm on bed rest.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> She's not that kind of a person. She's-she's generous and charitable.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're just saying that 'cause she's sleeping with you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes, that's my favorite charity.</p>", "6132": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What's going on?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon went to the Air Force behind our backs.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I did nothing of the sort. I had an idea for a neutrino-based communication system, I presented it to them, and they were interested.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But your communication system was based on our guidance system.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And sonar is based on bats. You don't see them hanging upside down in a patent attorney's office.</p>", "6133": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, that guidance system was my idea. You figured out how to make it work. We didn't even need Sheldon.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Let's not forget your idea was based on my theory.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, we're bagging on Sheldon here! Focus!</p>", "6134": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I guess it was pretty smart using our quantum technology as the basis for a communication system.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Be even better if he swapped out the helium for xenon.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Ooh. So instead of having to keep it at negative 271 degrees, you'd only have to keep it at negative 108. It would be way more efficient.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And xenon has a bigger nucleus, so coherence would make it an easier signal to see.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're brilliant!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We should tell Sheldon.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're an idiot! We don't tell Sheldon. We go to the military behind his back and we screw him like he screwed us.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, you're right, you're right, we don't need him. We can do this all on our own.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Do you think you can do the math?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. But if someone else does it, I can double check the crap out of it.</p>", "6135": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Kripke.<br><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> What's up, fellas?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Did you screw us over?<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Ooh, I can't tell you that. It's classified.</br></p>", "6136": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why did you tell Barry Kripke your idea? This is all your fault.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, it's your fault. If you would've come to us in the beginning, none of this would've happened.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, if it helps, you all behaved terribly and you deserve what you got.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that doesn't help, at all. You know, sometimes your social skills are very poor.</p>", "6137": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Can't believe we let Kripke use us like that.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, maybe you're all more like the guy who didn't invent the electric car and less like the guy who didn't invent the lightbulb.</p>", "6138": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Tesla was a genius who invented our electrical grid. Edison just wanted to get rich and famous.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Didn't he invent the lightbulb?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's what he wants you to think. But without the foundational work of Ebenezer Kinnersley, Warren de la Rue and James Bowman Lindsay, you wouldn't know Edison any more than you know Ebenezer Kinnersley, Warren de la Rue or James Bowman Lindsay.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Isn't he sexy all fired up? He really gets my current alternating, if you know what I mean.</p>", "6139": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, uh, who's free tonight?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I think I'm-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hang on. We've made this mistake before. It's how we wound up at his cousin Deepak's Tupperware party.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, you use that collapsible bowl all the time, and you know it.</p>", "6140": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, so they would act as natural dark matter detectors.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That sounds interesting.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It does, but it's still geology. Sorry, Bert, I don't have time to play rocks with you.</p>", "6141": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you for asking. Unfortunately, I have real science to do. But you feel free to rock on. (To Leonard) That's how you do it.</p>", "6142": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, what are you doing? Bert's one of the top guys in his field.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And somewhere there's a mime who's top in his field, but you don't see me rushing to collaborate with him on new ways to be stuck in a box.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Also something I would watch instead of cricket.</p>", "6143": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, let's-let's do it here, in-in the evenings, after everyone's gone home.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> I just have to see if my evenings are free. That's a joke. They are.</p>", "6144": "<p><strong>Ruchi:</strong> Arre uske taang pay ball kar!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What'd she say?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uske taang pay ball kar.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, that clears that up.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, no, she's telling the bowler to bowl a yorker. It's the most brutal ball in cricket.<br/><strong>Ruchi:</strong> I was at the match when Shoaib bowled back-to-back yorkers.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I was there, too! What a coincidence!<br/><strong>Ruchi:</strong> Well, there were 120,000 people at that match, so-<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, India, right? Everywhere you go, there's, like, 120,000 people.</p>", "6145": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (off-screen) Howard! Can you help me to the bathroom?!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, at least the romance is still alive.</p>", "6146": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What you got there?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A rock.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Did some mean boys throw it at you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It turns out I'm the mean boy. Although I did drop it on my own foot, so kind of.</p>", "6147": "<p><strong>Ruchi:</strong> I was supposed to go back to India and get married, but I realized it wasn't what I wanted. So I called off the engagement and moved out here.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, if he wasn't your soul mate, he wasn't your soul mate.<br/><strong>Ruchi:</strong> Oh, God, please tell me you're not one of those.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> One of whats?<br/><strong>Ruchi:</strong> I want to say teenage girls, but that sounds mean.</p>", "6148": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Come on, you don't believe that everyone has one perfect match?<br/><strong>Ruchi:</strong> Of course not. That's ridiculous. I mean, what if your soul mate lived halfway across the world? You'd never meet.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes, you would. I can give you, like, 20 examples where that happened to Kate Hudson alone.</p>", "6149": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Love isn't just science. Okay? It's-it's spiritual. It's an acknowledgment of a mystery that's greater than ourselves. It's what makes people write songs and poems, and what has kept The Bachelor on TV for 21 magical seasons.<br/><strong>Ruchi:</strong> Don't you think the fact that love is given away as a prize on a game show slightly undermines your argument?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, yes. But I've never missed an episode, and I dare science to explain that.</p>", "6150": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, what are you doing here?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Bert asked for my help.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Yeah, he's an excellent scientist, and he doesn't tell me what time I can go to the bathroom.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's called bladder training. When you're in your 80s, you'll thank me for it.</br></p>", "6151": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So you just shut the door in his face? I got to start writing this stuff down.</p>", "6152": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I mean, Ruchi's nice. We're just so different.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I know. Sometimes when you're dating, you meet weird people.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I once met a girl who didn't like juggling. And she still doesn't.</p>", "6153": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, hey, hey, I can watch your stupid baby, okay? If she cries, I will pick her up. If she's hungry, I'll give her a bottle. And if she poops, I'll light some incense.</p>", "6154": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We have to stop this and protect your legacy.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> What legacy? My-my last two seasons, I was on Sunday morning at 5:30.<br/>\nWe-we were beat by Davey and Goliath.</p>", "6155": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Arthur.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> You-you know, we could we could also meet in-in a deli.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry to say that I failed you. I tried to stop Wil Wheaton being Professor Proton, but I couldn't.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> See, now, that's-that's the kind of thing you could tell a fella over a pastrami sandwich.</p>", "6156": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, don't worry. He's now on my enemies list forever. He's totally cut off.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Interesting. Can-can anyone sign-sign up for that list?</p>", "6157": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> He meant a lot to Sheldon.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, me, too. I grew up watching his show. He's one of the reasons I became a scientist.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aw, thought you did it just to get girls.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Joke's on you. It worked.</p>", "6158": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Where are you going?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Gift shop.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> There is no gift shop. Sit down.</p>", "6159": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> This was your idea.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So was having sex, and look where that got us.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> This isn't a big deal. Stop whining.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> When you were in labor and I said that, you kicked me.</p>", "6160": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Want me to go with you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, I'll be fine.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (standing up to go with Howard) Yeah, we got this.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sit down!</p>", "6161": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And today, boys and girls, we're going to have fun with science. Did you know you could calculate the mass of an electron using household items? It's true. All you'll need is a pencil, some paper, dry ice, rubbing alcohol, and a spool of 50-micron-thick cobalt-60 wire. And, remember, don't put it in your mouth, or instead of becoming a scientist, you'll become wildly radioactive.</p>", "6162": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So the next time someone on the playground tells you you can only use integral values for the matrix that determines the spin of the anti-proton, you stop being friends with that kid, 'cause he's going nowhere.</p>", "6163": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't know what to say. Leonard, do you know what to say?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, uh, I thought it, uh, it looked like you were having so much fun.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, that's what you used to tell me to say to Penny after one of her terrible plays.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey! (Penny slaps Leonard)<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey!</p>", "6164": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You want to lie down, watch a movie?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I can't. I got my 16-week checkup to get to, and then I'll pick up some Chinese for dinner. I'll take Halley with me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You-you sure you're not overdoing it?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, it's fine.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Great. Then maybe, instead of Chinese, fire up the grill and throw on a couple of steaks? (Bernadette stares at him) Kung pao chicken, please.</p>", "6165": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> This is actually kind of nice, you and me getting to spend a couple days in bed together.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah. Pretty soon, we're gonna have two crying babies in the house.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (sighs) I'm glad my balls hurt. It's all their fault.</br></p>", "6166": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Penny, everything all right?!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, all good. Dipped her pacifier in a little bourbon, she conked right out.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I hope you're joking.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Of course I'm joking. I don't share my bourbon.</p>", "6167": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Some things shouldn't be rebooted. Some things were perfect the way they were. Like the walled city of York, it was a delight. But New York? Blech.</p>", "6168": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not leaving!<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> All right, I'm gonna stick my dog on you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You don't have a dog.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Yes, I do.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ugh, I can't tell if you're lying. You're such a good actor!</p>", "6169": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm getting a little hungry.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Want me to get it this time?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That'd be great.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (Shakes Howard's phone to produce a bell ringing sound) This is fun.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And now you also get to see an annoyed blonde walk into the room.</p>", "6170": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Excuse me while I go take care of your baby. Then I'll bring you your snack, and you can insult me some more.<br/>\n(Penny leaves)<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know about you, but I am not eating whatever she brings us.</p>", "6171": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> She was talking about me, Sheldon. I'm perfectly qualified.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, Howie's the world's best engineer. It says so right on his coffee mug.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aw, you got him a mug?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I did. But it's not a competition.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, I lost that battle years ago.</p>", "6172": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong>  I'll give it a go. My ride home with you was hellish.</p>", "6173": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, what is going on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, ever since Amy started working with Howard, she hasn't been home.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Didn't that just start this morning?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And has she been home?</p>", "6174": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You say you're busy as bees, yet here you are, dancing. Although I suppose bees do dance, but their dance lets other bees know where the pollen is, and yours does not. So my logic, despite that slight detour, does track.</p>", "6175": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You can't think this is the right time to \"validate his behavior.\"<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, what about \"presenting a united front\"?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What about you coddling him and he's never gonna learn?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, you sound frustrated, and I'm really proud of the way you're able to state your opinion.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you. Wait, no, no. Don't use that book on me!</p>", "6176": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howard's not here.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, I know, he's been in the lab every night this week with his work wife.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's weird, I thought his work wife was standing in my kitchen.</p>", "6177": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, what you reading?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> A parenting book.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, my God. Are-are we?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wha-- No! You think this is how I would tell you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well (stammering) ... you're sitting there with a book. It felt like anything was possible.</p>", "6178": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Now I'm having a son? I'll have to teach him how to play sports, and-and watch sports and-and-and-and-and-and--<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> He just ran out of man things. He's in trouble.</p>", "6179": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie, there's a lot of amazing things you can teach a son.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah. You do always know how to pick just the right antacid.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know if I can teach that. It's just something I was born with.</p>", "6180": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You have a replica Saturn V?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah. My dad bought it before he, you know, abandoned our family.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Lucky duck.</br></p>", "6181": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, I guess I'm an astrophysicist because, as a kid, I said I like to look at the stars, so my dad sent me to Hawaii to visit the Keck telescope. Screw you. My pain is real.</p>", "6182": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, as much as we've studied the brain, there's still a lot we don't know about dreams and their function. You know, even psychologists are divided on it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mm, it's true. Freud thought dreams were about sex, Adler thought they were about dominance-<br/> <strong>Penny:</strong> Then again, mine are just about being married to this little guy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, now it's just edging into mockery.</p>", "6183": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hello. Rajesh.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Stuart.<br/><strong>Ruchi:</strong> Hi. Ruchi.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Ruchi is my coworker. But that was probably in your briefing packet.</p>", "6184": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> After I got the flip-flops, I realized that the tops of my feet were exposed, so, um, I put on some sunscreen, which caused my feet to become slippery. And predictably, one of them fell off and went down a sewer grate. Now, normally, I would have walked away, but this is a new, laid-back me, so, instead of getting upset, I just reached down to grab it. That's when I touched something furry which I'm telling myself was a damp toupee.</p>", "6185": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, I-I finally came upon a bus bench where I sat and removed one of my shirts and, uh, fashioned it into a makeshift shoe. Not a waterproof shoe. That is relevant to the next part of my story, the ankle-deep puddle of warm apple juice.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Apple juice?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Maybe, maybe not. I'm telling myself a lot of things, Amy.</p>", "6186": "<p><strong>Ira Flatow:</strong> So, it has been five years since the discovery of the Higgs boson. What's the next big thing gonna be?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wow, that's hard to say. There's so much going on. We've been collecting tons of data that could revolutionize the way we understand the universe. For instance, there's a particle called a squark, which could prove super-symmetry.<br/><strong>Ira Flatow:</strong> That is interesting. Have you found it? <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What, the squark?<br/><strong>Ira Flatow:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, no. Wouldn't that be exciting? But we're also looking for the selectron, the gluino and the neutralino.<br/><strong>Ira Flatow:</strong> Well, and have you found that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.</p>", "6187": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, can we just drop this and have lunch like adults?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Very well. Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Pff!</p>", "6188": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Is this about what Leonard said on the radio?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Absolutely not. And I do not want to talk about Leonard. Can we please just talk about anything else?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> We could talk about my day.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Walked right into that one, didn't I?</p>", "6189": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> That is enough. Your lives are not wasted. Your careers are not at a dead end. You just hit a rough patch. Instead of feeling sorry for yourselves, you need to get up and get inspired.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't know. You know, when I'm feeling down, I go for a run, which is exactly why I'm not 180 pounds, genius!</p>", "6190": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I know where we need to go.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are we running there? Because watching drunk Sheldon run would be the highlight of my life.</p>", "6191": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I had no idea Richard Feynman was dead.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yep. Most people don't know he's actually buried right here in Altadena.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sure they keep a lid on that to avoid traffic jams.</p>", "6192": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, Feynman used to say he didn't do physics for the glory or the awards, but just for the fun of it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He was right. Physics is only dead when we stop being excited about it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Even beyond the grave, he's imparting wisdom.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Um, I'm the one who remembered it.</p>", "6193": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Stephen Hawking is a genius. If he said 'no,' I wasn't going to waste time on her father.</p>", "6194": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, Surprise!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, crap. Is it our anniversary?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. Wait. No.</p>", "6195": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So do you not want the cake?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Try and take it away, see what happens. (Penny starts eating as Leonard checks his phone).<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, crap, it is our anniversary.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (Her mouth covered in chocolate cake) Happy anniversary!</br></p>", "6196": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That may be true, but Dr. Nowitzki's just a friend. In fact, I wouldn't have even noticed she's a woman if she hadn't worn that bathing suit that highlighted her bosom.</p>", "6197": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I feel so betrayed. You know, all my life I thought Uncle Sam was a friendly uncle who brought you presents. Turns out he's the other kind.</p>", "6198": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Everyone, this is Rebecca.<br/><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Everybody:</strong> Hey.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She's younger and far more attractive than he is. They're copying you two!</p>", "6199": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Plus, I think I'm setting a good example for Halley, to show her that women can be mothers and still have satisfying careers. Sure, she won't know where I went or if I'm ever coming back. That'll just make the ten minutes between when I get home (voice breaking) and her bedtime even more special.</p>", "6200": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, Olsen twins!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I mean, I'm sitting right here. You're talking about my feelings and somehow leaving me out of the conversation.</p>", "6201": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, what do you know? Here I was, waiting to be bored with biology, and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy. Which, unlike my body, is an okay place to tickle.</p>", "6202": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Beverly pointed out that I'm experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy, in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What are you talking about? We're fine.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, you're fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems. It used to be me. Now it's Raj and his attack Tribble.</p>", "6203": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Nobody needs a mooch living in their house forever.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hey, that's no way to talk about your baby.</p>", "6204": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, it's humiliating. Thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What is there to gossip about? We barely have one.</p>", "6205": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, I've been meaning to ask you: what size shoe do you wear?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm trying to take more of an interest in other people's lives.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's nice. I wear a size eight and a half.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (giggles) That's small.</p>", "6206": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're awful quiet, everything okay?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm concerned about Amy. She's acting a bit odd lately.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, well, j-just out of curiosity, what registers as odd to you?</p>", "6207": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> She took my Where's Waldo.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, no, no, he's over there.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, yeah, there he is.</p>", "6208": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm serious, JPL's actually developing a robot arm that could grab an asteroid before it hits us.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So their plan for saving the Earth from Armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?</p>", "6209": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you know what else I love about you?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hmm?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Your handwriting is impeccable!<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Thank you for noticing!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I mean it. I mean it. It's like you have the soul of a label maker.</p>", "6210": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Are we there yet?!<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Soon.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why is it taking so long?!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Howard, Howard, look at the DVD screen. I put on Batman: The Animated Series. Your favorite!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm in too much pain (Batman music starts playing) to watch cartoo-- Oh! This is a good one.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I've been babysitting him way longer than you have.</br></p>", "6211": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> And that is how a short asthmatic scientist landed a stone-cold fox.</p>", "6212": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you, and now you're at an ice cream parlor trying to pick up women!</p>", "6213": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you okay? Oh, I'm fantastic, never been better. I had my first energy drink and I feel great. Hey, you guys want to wrestle? We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo. Nah, we're not fat enough, or wearing diapers.</p>", "6214": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Anyway, this is Leonard and Sheldon. The three of us came up with the guidance system.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And this is my friend, Raj.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, I'm not on the patent. I'm just here because there's a bumblebee in my office.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I saw it. It's big.</p>", "6215": "<p>Alfred Hofstadter: Now, one of the more exciting things to be found recently is that Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens frequently mated with each other.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Well, that certainly explains my marriage to Sheldon's father.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's funny because my father was not a very clever man.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'd be lost without you.</p>", "6216": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What is happening there?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think it's pretty obvious. They don't want dessert 'cause they filled up on bread.</p>", "6217": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Thank you for this. You know, ever since people found out I'm having a baby, I feel like I became Pregnant Bernadette. It was nice to take a little break tonight.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can understand that. From the moment people realized I was a genius, I've been Sheldon the Genius. Although I've never really wanted a break from that, so I suppose I don't understand. Which is ironic, 'cause, you know, genius.</p>", "6218": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, there's a cabin in Big Bear that a doctor I work with keeps offering me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because he's hitting on you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> She.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, good.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> But I could get her.</p>", "6219": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, hows it goin'?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Good. Slow.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> There's a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that it should go quicker.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Is there anything we can do to help?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know what, this part isn't that technical. You actually could.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then.</p>", "6220": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look at the 4K resolution. Next time we Skype, I'm gonna count all those nostril hairs.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Or you could just look into my eyes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But you only have two eyes. You got a lot of nostril hairs.</p>", "6221": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, that's cool. I guess everybody's involved in this project but me. So, see ya.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I feel bad. Should we have asked him to stay?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (From outside) Yes.</p>", "6222": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> But it's the one day a year that's just all about you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> One day. (Laughs) Right.</p>", "6223": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You realize none of those things would happen now?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I do, but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, you made my last birthday so memorable, I wanted to return the favor.</p>", "6224": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, if you had a party now, you have plenty of friends that would love to come.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And we live here, so we have no choice.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah.</p>", "6225": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe that's an idea, guidance systems for drunk people.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> They have that. It's called Uber.</br></p>", "6226": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm not finding anything either.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's a good sign.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, wait, I found something.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Damn. What is it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This video. The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared.</p>", "6227": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Rajesh, it's perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, you really think so?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, you know what's not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, we're rooting for you.</p>", "6228": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Please, all comments and questions should be flag-related.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> All right. Is my pole flag-related?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't see why not.</p>", "6229": "<p><strong>Claire:</strong> Do you think I could pick your brain for my movie some time? It's animated sci-fi for kids.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sure. I love animated movies.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> He does, and he has the Lilo &amp; Stitch collector plates to prove it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life.</p>", "6230": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> The real question is, where are you with Emily?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, it's hard to say. I think we're good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily's really the right person for me. I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No. Never.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Absolutely.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine. I had reservations about you, too.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, you didn't.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, I didn't.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, it doesn't matter now, 'cause I love how things worked out.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Me, too. And I think you're even more beautiful than this rose.</p>", "6231": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, we did have a vibe. This is exciting. What's my next move?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You still have a girlfriend.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Right. Good catch.</p>", "6232": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, I'm not the only one who's unpleasant when they're sick. When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Ooh, I just heard something. Might be hail, might be gunfire. Either way, I'm gonna go take pictures.</p>", "6233": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (monotone) I feel so, so bad.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, we're both great at this.</p>", "6234": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> There's this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps. I've been trying to get in for months.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, did you try wearing the shirt I said was inappropriate for work?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, the doctor's a woman, but yes, because you never know.</p>", "6235": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I just wish Stuart wasn't around so we didn't have to be so quiet.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I know. It's not like he returns the favor when he watches his Japanese porn cartoons.</p>", "6236": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> (from outside the room) You guys got a minute, or are you still cuddling?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What is it, Stuart?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Can I come in?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hang on. (quietly) Should I send him away?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, it's okay.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> (from outside the room) Thanks, Bernie.</p>", "6237": "<p><strong>Dr. Gallo:</strong> Sounds like you're holding on to quite a bit of anger towards her.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, no, I-I've worked through a lot of that stuff; I'm better now.<br/><strong>Dr. Gallo:</strong> Mmm, good for you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement, not mine?<br/><strong>Dr. Gallo:</strong> That's heartbreaking.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Right? To this day, I send her a card every year with a little money in it.</p>", "6238": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we've already collected, we'll know what it is that we found.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ooh, perhaps it's a Heliosheath scintillation.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It could be a trans-Neptunian object.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Maybe it's a new planet.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons, I'll be happy.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, the final image is coming in. And the object we discovered is-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Come on, Daddy needs a liveable planet he can rule with an iron fist.</p>", "6239": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'll give it to him next time I see him.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Have you heard from him since he left?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No. You'd think he would've called once he got settled in.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hmm, maybe he's busy.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Too busy to call? He wasn't too busy to binge-watch Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password.</p>", "6240": "<p><strong>Dr. Gallo:</strong> Wow, you really do have a lot on your plate.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> I do. You know, Leonard's right. Talking to you is really helping.<br/><strong>Dr. Gallo:</strong> Oh, I'm glad. You know, you might also benefit from a prescription for anxiety.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, if you think it'll help. Oh, just don't make it Placinex. I do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage.</br></p>", "6241": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> My doctor's worried about my circulation so I was thinking about walking around the mall.</p>", "6242": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Do you even like the Beach Boys?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They have \"beach\" right in the name. What do you think?</p>", "6243": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, look at us. Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife.</p>", "6244": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> We've only been doing this 20 minutes?!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, I read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. The key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Just because you have that accent doesn't mean what you say isn't stupid.</p>", "6245": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm the one who thought of \"Spockumentary.\"<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And I'm laughing like I did the first time I heard it.</p>", "6246": "<p><strong>Adam Nimoy:</strong> All right, we're just gonna have a conversation. Pretend the camera's not here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.</p>", "6247": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Aw. When he says things like that, I just want to hug him and make everything better.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> My brother was mean to me, too. Yeah, you probably had it coming.</p>", "6248": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We've gotten a little off-topic. Allow me to make things entertaining again in this little Spockumentary. That was Leonard's joke.</p>", "6249": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Look at us! We're like the Rockettes!</p>", "6250": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe you should consider women who aren't in serious relationships with your closest friends?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's that prostate doctor, but I'm still mad at her.</p>", "6251": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Are you attracted to him?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't know.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, I don't have to imagine it. (holds up her phone)</p>", "6252": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Let's begin with some fundamentals. This is the en garde position. Feet are in an L. Heels in a straight line. Elbow is about a fist from the rib cage. Notice my dominant leg faces forward.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, dear.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> What's wrong, Cooper?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I'm not sure I have a dominant leg. They're both pretty submissive.</p>", "6253": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, so it's a, it's a David and Goliath story. It's about man against God. It's called \"Hammer and Whip: The Untold Story of Thor vs. Indiana Jones.\"<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thor vs. Indiana Jones? You just blew my filking mind.</p>", "6254": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What's wrong with Mexico?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, Mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around because there's a worm inside.</p>", "6255": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> You don't need a yellow fever shot to go to Mexico.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You can never be too careful. I got one last year before I went to Epcot.</br></p>", "6256": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, we're getting married. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But you've been engaged for over a year now, and you don't even have a wedding date. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, we will. We're just not in a rush. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We're gonna set a date. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. If you say so. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, it's just, things are good right now. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really good. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm focusing on my job. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And we've been busy with our paper. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So busy. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, we'll pick a date when we pick a date. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, I can see why Amy's mad at you!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, shut up, Sheldon!</p>", "6257": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Bernie, Stuart just pulled up. So remember, the key is to be firm. Show no weakness. <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Right. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Good luck.</p>", "6258": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It actually says \"at least\"? <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why would they say \"at least\"? Is it 10 toggles? Is it 100 toggles? Is it 1,000 toggles? 10,000 toggles? 100,000 toggles?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You see where I'm going with this.</p>", "6259": "<p><strong>Mrs. Koothrappali:</strong> Rajesh, is your father seeing someone? <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> All I know, Mummy, is that he's a single wealthy doctor, and now, for some reason, there's no money for your little boy.</p>", "6260": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So it's settled. The fate of Doctor Who's TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones-inspired death match on the battlefield of Thundercats versus Transformers.</p>", "6261": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look, I am simply going to defend our work, scientist to scientist. And, failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers.</p>", "6262": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> \"Upon review, I've changed my mind about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a super-fluid. In fact, it's inspired me to come up with my own theory. Maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket. Much like Cooper and Hofstadter.\"</p>", "6263": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Why? What did I do?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm sorry. I had to get the spotlight off me, and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training.</p>", "6264": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I miss Stuart's place. All this loud music and exposed brick, is this a comic book store or a rave at the third little pig's house?</p>", "6265": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I brought coffee. I wasn't sure what you like, so I got a regular, a cappuccino and a chai tea. Since you like Raj, I thought you might be into that.</p>", "6266": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's like when I thought there was possum in my closet. Did I sit around wondering? No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I killed his chewbacca slippers.</p>", "6267": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know the only thing worse than a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass, is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass.</p>", "6268": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> The funeral's on Sunday.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But that's Star Wars day.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. Off all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one.</p>", "6269": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> The guys are about to start Jedi. Do you want to go watch?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I do. After I make them go back and watch 1 through 5.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That will take all night.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's true. Good thing I had that nap.</p>", "6270": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My mother would lock her car if she had to drive through his hodgepodge of ethnicity.</p>", "6271": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't understand why you're not upset with Amy.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am. So much so that I'm going to bring her here for dinner on our next date night.</br></p>", "6272": "<p><strong>Psychic:</strong> Your spirit guides are telling me there's a woman in your life you're having problems with.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's an easy guess. I'm clearly an annoying person. I have trouble with both genders.<br/><strong>Psychic:</strong> Yes, you clearly are.</p>", "6273": "<p><strong>Emily:</strong> It's fine. All my friends love this story. They call you Clogzilla.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster.</p>", "6274": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, you guys just time travelled so stop looking so bored.</p>", "6275": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mr. Nye, hello. I'm sorry he got you involved in this nonsense.<br/><strong>Bill Nye:</strong> He told me I'd be speaking to a class.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson.</p>", "6276": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, not that book! It's got like every horrible story from my childhood in it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh cool, are there pictures?<br/></p>", "6277": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You think you're so cool because your wife is a person?</p>", "6278": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe it's a shipping problem. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam just got action figures that look like you guys.</p>", "6279": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I gotta tell you, this is the most holiday fun I've had since my therapist changed my anxiety medication and I stopped caring about the blood in my stool.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Good story.</p>", "6280": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that in mind, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its validity.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath.</p>", "6281": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I think the next time I have to speak to a call center in India, I'm going to try use an American accent.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Because when I use my regular voice, I feel like I'm making fun of them.</p>", "6282": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Heads up. Professor Rothman urinated in the physics lab again. So we're going to move up his retirement party. Friday 5 o'clock pot luck.</p>", "6283": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Sheldon informed me that you're experiencing an emotional upheaval, and I'm here to help.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's so nice.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> And we're back to the obvious. Now, what's up?</p>", "6284": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm Penny. I'm his neighbor.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I'm Beverly Hofstadter.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Nice to meet you. *Offers to shake hands*<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oh, you're a hand shaker. Interesting.</p>", "6285": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How was rock climbing?<br><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> He passed out. He just hung there like a big salami.</br></p>", "6286": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> If you're not there, you'll be exposed to ridicule.</p>", "6287": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> *knock knock knock* Penny! (x3)<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, what is it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard's asleep.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thanks for the update.</p>", "6288": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You went out and bought linen?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't be silly, I borrowed one of your pillow cases.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Borrowed?</p>", "6289": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Excuse me, my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts.<br/><strong>Althea:</strong> No, he's not.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes he is.<br/><strong>Althea:</strong> Look, sir, we are very busy here and I just don't ... (Sees Howard's heavily swollen face) holy crap!</p>", "6290": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Nobody ever expects me. And bam! Howard Wolowitz.</p>", "6291": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Huh.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, how do you feel?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't understand the question.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well I'm just asking if it's difficult to be fighting with your best friend.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. I hadn't thought about it like that. I wonder if I've been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, what?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I couldn't poop this morning.</p>", "6292": "<p><strong>Leslie:</strong> Just so we're clear, you understand that me hanging back to practise with you is a pretext for letting you know that I'm sexually available.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Yeah, I'm good to go.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I thought you weren't interested in me.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You mean my cello?<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> No, I mean the obvious crude double entendre. I'm seducing you.</p>", "6293": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We had a good run, you and I.</p>", "6294": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sing me Soft Kitty?</p>", "6295": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Shucks means shucks. Let one go once in a while.</p>", "6296": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Outstanding. And if we fail, we can always stop at CVS and pick you out a nice toothbrush. I call mine Gerard.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's a bit sad.</p>", "6297": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If I'm not taking credit for our work, then nobody is!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, you admit that it's our work!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, once again I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are welcome.<br/><strong>Howard</strong>: Oh no he didn't!</p>", "6298": "<p><strong>Ira Flatow:</strong> Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My pleasure, Ira.<br/><strong>Ira Flatow:</strong> Now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet, which has, as even the most uneducated (voice becoming high-pitched) in your audience must know, two poles (clears throat) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have 2 smaller magnets each with it's own north and south pole.<br/><strong>Ira Flatow:</strong> Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has 2 poles. The primary characteristics of a monopoles is that it has only one pole, hence, \"monopole\".</p>", "6299": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (To Stuart) I can buy all these things online, I come here for the personal service.</p>", "6300": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Have you ever seen a body so fine?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> We had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class but none of them moved like that.</br></p>", "6301": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can you break a twenty?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> No, I only have hundreds.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know what. I don't always recognize sarcasm, but I do right now and I don't appreciate it. I'm sorry for your loss, but you're not the only one whose day's been a disaster.</p>", "6302": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It would actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me. Every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it. Do our traditions mean nothing to you?</p>", "6303": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So I can drink this drink without giving up the goodies?</p>", "6304": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh gosh. Sheldon, the genius, is jealous of Leonard.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not jealous. I'm just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me.</p>", "6305": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, that would be a little more like getting into dracula's coffin.</p>", "6306": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I know they're poison, but they look like big, yummy otter pops.</p>", "6307": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (About Bernadette) She's so tiny!</p>", "6308": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's it, no more Thai food.</p>", "6309": "<p><strong>Ruchi:</strong> Are you sure you're okay with this?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Honestly, Ruchi, I don't have a lot of experience with casual relationships. I have some experience with serious relationships and a ton of experience with no relationships.</p>", "6310": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Is she single?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm not setting her up with Raj.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What about Stuart?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Are you listening? I want her to think I'm not mean.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay. Well, it's just we have two single friends.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie, I just met this woman. Why don't I wait a little and get to know her? Maybe I won't like her, and then I'd be happy to ruin her life with Stuart or Raj.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's all I ask.</p>", "6311": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, you guys lived with Sheldon for a long time-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Long time.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So very long.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> By the way, congratulations again on your engagement.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, you got a good one.</p>", "6312": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> And, you know, Raj, I think it's great that you no longer live off your parents like a spoiled child. You live over someone's garage like a failed adult.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, well, you live with her.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, it's not like that. He rents a room from me and my husband. Who, by the way, is no prize, either.</p>", "6313": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Ruchi said she wanted to hang out with both of us. Why don't we just do that?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, fine. Let's hang out as friends and see what happens.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, and if something grows out of it, just worry about it then.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Also what my doctor said.</p>", "6314": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Look, Ruchi and I are really hitting it off. Please let me just have this one!<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'm not going anywhere. I'm like a fungus you can't get rid of.<br/><strong>Ruchi:</strong> Sorry. So what's going on?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, you just missed Stuart's funny story about the fungus he can't get rid of.</p>", "6315": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What happened to your other flip-flop?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, well, that involves what I am telling myself was a melted candy bar.</br></p>", "6316": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Yeah, you've got that. I've got my integrity. Hard to say which one is better without making you feel bad. I may not be making as much money as you, but at least I'm doing something that I know makes people's lives better.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey! My work makes peoples lives better. Especially if you have moderate to severe eczema and don't mind if you lose teeth.</p>", "6317": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon's right. I would never ask a woman if she was pregnant, unless she tells me or I see a human being wiggling out of her.</p>", "6318": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, Sheldon, I'm pregnant.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Congratulations. How far along are you?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> About three months.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Only three? Good gravy, how many babies are in there?</p>", "6319": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, I was just speaking the truth. We're scientists. Isn't that what we're supposed to do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, what would you know about the truth? You thought Phantom Menace was \"not half bad.\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I told you that in confidence!</p>", "6320": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ms. Davis, you wanted to see me?<br/><strong>Ms. Davis:</strong> Yes, Dr. Hofstadter, come on in.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Should I sit or stand? I'm not used to being called into the dean's office.<br/><strong>Ms. Davis:</strong> Please, sit.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I have to say I'm a little nervous.<br/><strong>Ms. Davis:</strong> You should be.</p>", "6321": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I guess we can brag to each other.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's a great idea.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Damn right it is; I came up with it. (chuckles) That felt good.</p>", "6322": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Feynman was so cool. When I was a kid, I'd put on some headphones and crank up one of his lectures and just jam out to knowledge.</p>", "6323": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's like having Optimus Prime over to dinner and not asking him to turn into a truck.</p>", "6324": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I know this isn't easy, but you'll have a whole lifetime to practice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It could take that long, I'm really bad at it.</p>", "6325": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Do you think Sheldon's gonna want some weird Star Trek wedding?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't know.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, Leonard could barely finish the words \"Doctor Who wedding cake\" before I shut that down hard.</p>", "6326": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Why don't you stay a few extra days?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I don't have any other clothes.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> We'll get you some.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I don't know, I'm pretty particular.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, there's a comic book store less than a mile from here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perfect, let's go shopping.</p>", "6327": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, um, and I'm having dinner with some colleagues tonight. I'm sure they'd love to meet you. Come on, what do you say?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aw, you're nagging me. It's like we're already married.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Is that a yes or a no?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Geez, save some for the honeymoon.</p>", "6328": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hello, Ramona.<br/><strong>Ramona Nowitzki:</strong> Mm. Hello.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why are you sitting by yourself? Oh, that's right, Sheldon's in New Jersey being engaged to Amy.<br/><strong>Ramona Nowitzki:</strong> I heard.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Now that Sheldon's out of the picture, I could give you one more chance to go out with me.<br/><strong>Ramona Nowitzki:</strong> Nope, I'm good.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You sure? I will not ask again.<br/><strong>Ramona Nowitzki:</strong> I sincerely hope not.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Very well.  I'm going to leave before this gets awkward.</p>", "6329": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, where are you going?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm storming off to my room.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, then where am I supposed to storm off to?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, you're so smart, why don't you figure it out? (door closes)<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is there another bedroom? Perhaps a-a den?</p>", "6330": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, there's something I need to say to you.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm listening.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've been thinking about the Avengers.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I believe that. But I don't think that's something you needed to say to me.</br></p>", "6331": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Dr. Nowitzki?<br/><strong>Ramona Nowitzki:</strong> Oh. Dr. Fowler. Um, hello.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Thank you. Thank you so much.</p>", "6332": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Gentlemen, the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Unless it was singing \"Be Our Guest,\" I doubt it.</p>", "6333": "<p><strong>Guy #2:</strong> Ready to go?<br/><strong>Guy:</strong> Hang on. This guy's telling me how he got the Serial Ape-ist girl to marry him.<br/><strong>Guy #2:</strong> This guy? But he's wearing a change maker.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I think it's hot.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's right. I'm her change daddy.</p>", "6334": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Look at you. Willy Wonka would roll you to the juicing room.</p>", "6335": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, it's all real exciting.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are-are you not happy about this?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I am. Of course I am. I'm sure it's just the hormones. But it's weird. Howie's the one who's been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he'd be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and I'm gonna get fat.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, no, come on. Come on, you're not gonna get fat. You're gonna be beautiful and glowing and have the cutest little baby bump ever.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Easy for you to say, skinny bitch.</p>", "6336": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sorry, Bernie and I are breaking in the new hot tub, if you know what I mean.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not a clue.</p>", "6337": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, my goodness, she's coming to visit!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, it'll be nice to finally meet her.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, you are going to love her. She is the kindest, sweetest woman you'll ever meet. Yeah, unless you're a gopher digging up her vegetable garden. In that case, you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel.</p>", "6338": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look, let's all let's remain calm and analyze this situation. Now, I realize that you've only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> You leave the room and let the grown-ups talk. Now!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Don't speak to him like he's a child.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you. Now, I'm gonna go next door and play with Leonard.</p>", "6339": "<p><strong>Meemaw:</strong> Young lady, if you think I don't know what it's like to live with a stubborn, egotistical man, then you're wrong. 'Cause that was my husband.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Meemaw:</strong> There were days I wanted to fill his pockets with corn and toss him in the pigpen.</p>", "6340": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, that's it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I guess so.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> This is weird.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, a grown man moving into his own apartment. Crazy times. See ya!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Ignore him. He's just using humor to express how ... happy he is.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> It's okay. I know he loves me.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sure he does.</p>", "6341": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you think about giving Sheldon's ticket to Stuart?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know. Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's like going with your grandpa. Instead of eating popcorn, he brings little pieces of chicken in Tupperware and a Thermos full of soup.</p>", "6342": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> If we're friends, we should be able to talk about anything.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So, you had some questions about me seeing other people.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just a few.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Go ahead.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How many dates have you been on? Who were they with? Where'd you go? Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them? And how much longer to the aquarium? I'm getting kind of hungry.</p>", "6343": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Look at that. I'm in a movie, my shirt stayed on.</p>", "6344": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So how can we help?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, I know more women are buying comics than ever, but for some reason, I can't get 'em in here.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All right. Well, what have you tried so far?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Uh, I've been stocking more female-oriented titles. In the bathroom, I folded the end of the toilet paper into a triangle. And, uh, you are now sitting in the official breastfeeding area.</p>", "6345": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> When you're in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Right. Always right.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> He's a righty.</br></p>", "6346": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Have you thought about advertising directly to females?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hmm, okay. Well, all right. What if I put up a sign in the window that said, \"Women, come in. Don't be afraid.\"?</p>", "6347": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I mean, what can I do? I get so nervous around women.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, you're talking to us now. I mean, you don't seem nervous.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, that's 'cause I'm doing that trick where you imagine the audience is naked. By the way, thumbs up, ladies.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> It was a joke.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Was it?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> No, I'm still doing it.</p>", "6348": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Besides, a bar is where I belong. I'm having female problems.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If you're cranky and retaining water, I have a theory.</p>", "6349": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How about you?<br/><strong>Older Woman:</strong> I'm married, and I'm her grandmother.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah, what might have been.</p>", "6350": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And you, give my regards to Barnum and Bailey.</p>", "6351": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I said no.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I didn't know you were interested in dating.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've been told it's a good way to move on.</p>", "6352": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, can you believe that we're driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century?<br/>\nIt's like the Batmobile. If Batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn't cool.</p>", "6353": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I can't believe you made out with Mandy Chow.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, trust me I wish it never happened.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And you knew about this the whole time?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I did.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And you didn't think to tell me?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Leonard asked me to keep it to myself.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Let's leave Leonard out of this for the moment. This is about you and me.</p>", "6354": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are we done?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Not yet. This is fun.<br/>\nOoh, I know. I'd let her free my willy.</p>", "6355": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You'd think I'd be used to women withholding their love. My mother did. No matter how hard I tried, she just didn't have any interest in me.<br/><strong>Mandy:</strong> Imagine that.</p>", "6356": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> And you promise you're okay with everything from the car?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh my God, Will you stop bringing it up?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're right. I'm sorry. We have the rest of our lives to dredge up stuff from the past and fight about it.</p>", "6357": "<p><br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh, what's going on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She broke up with me.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh, Shelly.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I'll be okay. But I think I'd like to send the ring back to you.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Let's not be hasty. Are you sure it's over for good?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's over for me. I'm done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks, they both hurt you on purpose.</p>", "6358": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift.</p>", "6359": "<p><strong>Mrs. Koothrappali:</strong> Well, however much money your father was giving you, I'll give you more.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you, Mummy! I love you! *to Sheldon and Howard* Helicopters for everybody!</p>", "6360": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, leaving an envelope of cash on my night-stand after sex would count as weird.</br></p>", "6361": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> She made him a chore chart.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I see it!</p>", "6362": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, maybe you're right. I used to think my high school P.E. teacher didn't like me, but it turned out she liked me a little too much.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. It was fine. We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert, I got an A, it all worked out.</p>", "6363": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> It has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives. Although it can cause acne, which if you ask me kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive.</p>", "6364": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> The important thing is I am here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.</p>", "6365": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I typically wear pajamas, but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle. And pajamas are the sleep pants of The Man.</p>", "6366": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What's wrong with your car?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm having my windows untinted.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I've got a hot girlfriend now. I want the haters to know.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What are you talking about? No one's paying attention to you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wow. How's that hater-ade taste, bro?</p>", "6367": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I'm a people person. People like me. Some of my favorite people are people. I feel like I'm saying people a lot. People people people. Okay, I'm done.<br/><strong>Dan:</strong> Sure?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> People. Yes.</p>", "6368": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And by the way, I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup. You're supposed to use the powder.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It tastes the same.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, the syrup tastes better and I don't like it.</p>", "6369": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Have you had intercourse?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well stick to your guns. There'll be a lot of pressure.</p>", "6370": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I've just never known anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. When he died we didn't have a funeral, we had a barbecue.</p>", "6371": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Maybe we should see how he's doing. ... But after the Cantina scene?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Obviously.</p>", "6372": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, what did you think of your first funeral?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't want to be a jerk but it was kind of a bummer.</p>", "6373": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There was obvious someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard's lengthy sea voyage and Penny's famously ravenous nether regions.</p>", "6374": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, Leonard, I think it's high time we address the tweepadoc in the room.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The what?</p>", "6375": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Come on, we could have a pants party! Go put some on!</p>", "6376": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Ooh! Girls' night, girls' night. Ooh, ooh!<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> How does he not hear that?</br></p>", "6377": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> And, once again, my baloney likes girls.\n</p>", "6378": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off, I'd say it's spot on.</p>", "6379": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Hey, Hofstadter. Heard about your latest proton anti-decay experiment. 20,000 data runs and no statistically significant results. Very impressive.</p>", "6380": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> I like to floss before I eat so my gum pockets are open to new food.</p>", "6381": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's actually based on a very sound thesis. His mother published a paper on it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What was it called? \"I hate my son and that's why he can't have cake\"?</p>", "6382": "<p><strong>Althea:</strong> Fill these out.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you. We'll be right back.<br/><strong>Althea:</strong> Oh, take your time. I'll just finish my crossword puzzle. Oh wait.</p>", "6383": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (To the cleaning ladies) You saw nothing!</p>", "6384": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, Saturday is the big day. A lot of people thought this would never come. I may have been one of those people.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I may have been one of those people.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, wait, are we talking about the wedding?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, yeah, I was definitely one of those people.</p>", "6385": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, I like harp lessons, but I'm thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons.</p>", "6386": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is Penny crying?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course not. They thrive on our suffering.</p>", "6387": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, I'm more than smart enough to take your class.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> *Laughs* No.</p>", "6388": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My girlfriend wanted to move in with me. Which was no doubt a ploy just to see my, excuse my language, bathingsuit parts.</p>", "6389": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We might want to live together.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Well, I've already given this some thought. And I'm willing to let Penny live with us, one day a week for a trial period. Now, obviously not when she's made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining.</p>", "6390": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> This is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat. ... Oh, that's me getting rescued when I fell in.</p>", "6391": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> All this time, I never knew there were steam tunnels down here.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Most universities have them. When I was an undergrad, I spent three days in one pledging a sorority.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Did you get in?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, they forgot I was there. But it really opened up my pores.<br/></br></p>", "6392": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> It's a good thing I'm not wearing flag underwear right now, cause there's about to be a fire.</p>", "6393": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll get right to the point. I think we need to end this relationship. So, sign this with your finger and please don't cry on my iPad. I didn't get AppleCare.</p>", "6394": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I haven't seen Raj in several days. Is he no longer part of our social group? And if so, should we be interviewing for a replacement? Perhaps this time we go Latin.</p>", "6395": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh. Watch out, Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Droll.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Not as droll as a grown man passed out in a puddle of his own urine.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.\n</p>", "6396": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thanks for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.<br><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Well, I know how to take care of my baby. His eyes came out a little thin, but you can just pretend he's Chinese.</br></p>", "6397": "<p><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> I would like a slippery nipple.</p>", "6398": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Hang on. (To Howard) What do I need to do to make you trust me?\n<br><strong>Howard:</strong> You think it's hard having one wife? Try having two!</br></br></p>", "6399": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I can't argue with him, it's right there on the screen. Austria does look like a wiener.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's nothing. Dude, go check out how hung Florida is.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sure Mrs. Florida's walking funny.</p>", "6400": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If your video's frozen try re-setting the TCP/IP stack.</p>", "6401": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's awfully sticky.</p>", "6402": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, Howie, can you give me a hand? I need to get some work done, and the kids are climbing all over me.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You know what? I'll watch them.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You sure?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I was just about to tell everyone why they're called Pennsylvania Dutch when they really hail from Germany.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yep.</p>", "6403": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So, what do you think? Pretty cool, huh? And when our kids outgrow it, we can Airbnb it to other people's babies.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Funny.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You all right? Sorry, I haven't had a second to myself. So let me just go back inside, finish my report, brush my teeth, change out of my pajamas, make a sandwich, and then I'll come out here and laugh at your joke.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Ooh. As long as you're making sandwiches- You can laugh at that one later, too.</p>", "6404": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you. I'll get started right away.<br/><strong>President Siebert:</strong> And I look forward to hearing nothing about it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I will keep you posted.</p>", "6405": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, thank you guys again for helping out yesterday.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> No problem. That was really fun.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It was fun. But I am sore.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You didn't lift a finger.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, but I narrated the entire event, and I am paying for it today.</br></p>", "6406": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Gentlemen.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Leonard, do I detect a little swagger in your step?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mm, possibly.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, stop. It doesn't suit you.</p>", "6407": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Cute, but President Siebert trusted me with this, and I'm taking it seriously. If you have a legitimate request, you can submit it to me in writing, and I'll evaluate it based on its merits.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sure, sure. Is \"Jet Ski\" one word or two?</p>", "6408": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Bad news, Howie. I'm gonna be stuck at work for a while. Oh, that's terrible.<br/>\nHang in there. I'll be home as soon as I can. (sighs) He deserves better.</p>", "6409": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, you should have seen him, denying things left and right. It was so sexy. 'Course, I made a request he did not deny.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Uh-huh.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you listening to me?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, sure. You slept with your husband.</p>", "6410": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I've been telling Howie that I've had to work late the past couple nights, but really, I've just been hiding out in Howie's playhouse. Does that make me awful?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Awful? No. Uh, strange? Yes. Sad? A little, yes.</p>", "6411": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, you go home and sit alone in a toy house in the backyard?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah!</p>", "6412": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, l-look, I only have enough money to fund one request, but your project is definitely in the running.<br/><strong>Doctor Lee:</strong> Okay, but, uh, when do you think you might make a decision? Because I have to upgrade their cages before they learn how to open the locks. When I came in to my lab this morning, they suddenly got silent. I think they're planning something.</p>", "6413": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Whoa, whoa, whoa! So you're just gonna give the money to your friend? I smell a rat.<br/><strong>Doctor Lee:</strong> I work with rats, too. That might be me.</p>", "6414": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm not just giving it to my friend, Barry. Your proposal is also in the mix.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wait, so those are the three? You're not even considering mine? Why, because they're PhDs and I'm just an engineer?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, because they wrote detailed proposals, and you sent a YouTube clip of the guy from Jerry Maguire saying, \"Show me the money!\"</p>", "6415": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I can tell you're stressed. If it helps, I withdraw my proposal.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It doesn't help.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine. Then I'm back in the mix. Show me the money!</p>", "6416": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, I just- I need everyone to back off. I'm in charge here, and I'll decide when I'm ready to decide.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> When will that be?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> A day, a week. I don't know!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Where are you going?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know that either!</p>", "6417": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> There has got to be a right decision based on empirical evidence. Look, I made pros and cons lists, and then I came up with three different scoring systems to determine the best project. I just don't know what scoring system to use. So I'm working on a meta-scoring system to score the scoring systems, but the math is really complicated. You want me to walk you through it?</p>", "6418": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How do you not care what people think of you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's easy. I mean, not \"beating you at chess\" easy, but what is?</p>", "6419": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Thanks for letting me come over and hang.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So Leonard still hasn't made a decision yet?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No. And I've really been laying on the guilt.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Did you break out the sad eyes?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You mean these bad boys?</p>", "6420": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Seriously, Leonard, you didn't pick my project?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sorry, Raj.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Did you go with Crow Lady?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You gave the money to Kripke?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I did not.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wait, I'm confused. I thought there were only three projects in contention.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> There were. But, at the last minute, someone submitted an application for a pretty cool europium-doped laser, and they made a very compelling case.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What was the case?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, that it was me and I wanted it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You-you can't do that. You can't just fund your own project.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, it turns out I can, and I did.</br></p>", "6421": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Bernadette, why don't we get to dress up at work?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We used to, but a couple guys in the infectious disease lab went as zombies and it triggered a quarantine. The CDC was so mad.</p>", "6422": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, if you really want to dress up, we could throw a party.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that would be fun. You know, I used to throw Halloween parties all the time when I moved into the building.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> All the time? I only remember being invited to one.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Please don't make this awkward for me.</p>", "6423": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What are you going as?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't want to ruin the surprise. You'll see it at work. Just a warning: it's pretty scary.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is it a bird?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is it a dog?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I think I'll be fine, then.</p>", "6424": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you gonna dress in drag in front of your fiancee?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah. We have no secrets from each other. Well, except for the fact that I crocheted this myself.</p>", "6425": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, he's being you. He's dressed as you for Halloween.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. So you're not laughing at him. You're laughing at me.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> We're not laughing at you. We're laughing with you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I'm not laughing.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Then the first one.</p>", "6426": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, happy Halloween.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh! Trick or treat.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. Sorry, you're not wearing a costume.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I am. I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm gonna need more.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, failed actress who traded constant rejection for a Christmas bonus and a dental plan?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Go nuts.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. I will.</p>", "6427": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, what are you wearing to the party? Sexy cat? Sexy nurse? Sexy zombie?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why do girls' costumes have to be sexy but guys' costumes don't?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (scoffs) Say that again with this helicopter on my head.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Very cute.</p>", "6428": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You're not mad at me, are you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. Of course not. No, we just remember different things from that party. I remember falling in love, and you remember vomiting in a pumpkin.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I was, like, four feet away. People cheered.</p>", "6429": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Anyway, the point is, Sheldon shouldn't dish it out if he can't take it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I think the point is that Howard owes him an apology.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, well, I think the point is if Sheldon has a problem with Howard, Sheldon should take it up with him. Now, if you'll excuse me, the prime minister of England needs her diaper changed.</p>", "6430": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, that's great. He's a Supreme Court justice, and you're the U.S. Constitution.<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> Yep. He interprets me. And guess what's underneath this? The Bill of Tights.</p>", "6431": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, Bert, what are you dressed as?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> I'll give you a hint. My work in seismic refraction measurements and-<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, Stuart, what are you dressed as?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'm a butterfly.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Did you steal those from Halley's \"let's pretend\" box?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'm gonna put them back.</p>", "6432": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> All right, I'll tell you. I'm Maurice \"Doc\" Ewing, winner of the 1960 Vetlesen Prize, generally regarded as the Nobel Prize of geology.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, yeah. Now I see it.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Ask me how I died. Spoiler alert: brain hemorrhage.</p>", "6433": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, here we are. On Halloween. On this couch. Does it ring any bells?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? We're still doing this?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm just surprised you don't remember our first kiss.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (sighs) Fine. It was on Halloween.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you agreeing just to shut me up?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You got another way? I'm all ears.</p>", "6434": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Really? An arranged marriage?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah. I know how it sounds.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> It sounds awesome. Is that just an Indian thing, or can I get a piece of that?<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> You know the woman has a choice, right?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> There's always a catch.</p>", "6435": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, guys, I think that's enough.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Hold on. I'm the judge here, and I'm going to allow it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Raj, take a break.<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> Hey, free speech. Right back there somewhere.</br></p>", "6436": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You know what, guys? You got us. Congratulations. Now why don't you go back to your apartment and put on your other costumes.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, but it's so far away, and I have such teeny, tiny legs.</p>", "6437": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> I don't get invited to a lot of parties. Is this a good one?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, yeah.</p>", "6438": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Can't believe Amy did that.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, come on. You thought it was funny when I dressed up as Sheldon.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That was totally different.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> How?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That didn't hurt my feelings.</p>", "6439": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, for what it's worth, I didn't think it was a very good impression of you.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Really? You don't think I have an annoying high-pitched voice?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, not at all. In fact, I find your voice quite melodious.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Mm-hmm. And you don't think I'm unnecessarily hurtful?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What? I'm sorry. I-I couldn't hear the question. I just heard the music.</p>", "6440": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> That was beautiful.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mm.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you still doing here?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I was in the bathroom. Guacamole didn't agree with me.</p>", "6441": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Anyway, if you guys could apologize, it'd be a big help.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, we'd be happy to apologize to her as soon as she apologizes to me for not making you apologize to Sheldon.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I didn't follow that, but, then, between my wife and that guacamole, I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.</p>", "6442": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Don't you think it's unreasonable for her to ask us to do something she refused to do?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes. So when can you stop by?</p>", "6443": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, Chewbacca was losing and getting angry and-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> W-W-Wait. Are you saying we should let the Wookiee win?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey. Hey, that's my wife you're talking about. (whispers) But yes, let the Wookiee win.</p>", "6444": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Is that watermelon for anybody?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's for Halley.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is she gonna eat all of it? God, no wonder she looks like Churchill.</p>", "6445": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What do you want, Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard said your feelings were hurt.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, Howard's wrong. I don't care if someone makes fun of me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right. Apparently I came all this way for nothing. Unless Halley wants to share that watermelon?</p>", "6446": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You think Amy's the first person to make fun of me for having a squeaky voice? Do you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I feel like my chance at watermelon is dangling by a thread.</p>", "6447": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> The kids called me Bernadette the marionette.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (laughs) Because you're small. That's funny.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, it's not.</p>", "6448": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I guess we both had to put up with a lot of crap from people.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I suppose we have. Huh. Maybe you and I are more alike than we thought.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Maybe we are.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Although I'm exceptionally tall, and you're exceptionally-<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You didn't even let me finish.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Fine. Sorry.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Short.</p>", "6449": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What do you guys think you're doing?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> We're showing Sheldon Halloween.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Absolutely not. Sheldon, come home.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I really want to watch it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I know you do, but I am forbidding it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, man. Sorry, guys.<br/>\n[in the hallway:]<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What took you so long?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm sorry. I just got your text!</p>", "6450": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Recently, 12 new moons were discovered orbiting Jupiter, bringing the total up to 79.<br>\nAs a middle child myself, I'd like to extend my sympathies to moons two through 78. Your grandpa will never learn your name. I'd like to thank you for joining me on this journey through the stars. If you enjoyed this lecture, please come back Thursday for the exact same one.</br></p>", "6451": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Do I look like I just woke up?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Great. I'm gonna go say hey to Raj.</p>", "6452": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What were you guys giggling about?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> They were passing notes to each other.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh-ho, love notes?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> If you love math.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And we do.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's for our super-asymmetry theory.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, Amy and I have been having so much fun collaborating together.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, you know what they say, you never collaborate as much as your first year of marriage.</p>", "6453": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, Howard, uh, this is Andrea. She's the director of the planetarium.<br/><strong>Andrea:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Nice to meet you. I'm Howard Wolowitz. Engineer, husband, father, astronaut.<br/><strong>Andrea:</strong> Really? You're an astronaut?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, I don't like to brag.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hmm, yeah, but somehow, you manage.</p>", "6454": "<p><strong>Andrea:</strong> Raj, you should have Howard join you for one of your shows.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, that might be fun.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It might be, but with two small children at home and a full-time job, I'm sure you're too busy.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, I could find the time.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, you don't have to decide right now.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's okay, I-<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> He can't do it.</p>", "6455": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, hurry up, guys. The gift shop's closing, and Amy said I can get one big thing or two little things.</p>", "6456": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So I'm gonna place the sensory isolation helmet on you for about five minutes. All you need to do is sit still and relax.<br/><strong>Colin:</strong> What do I do if I start to get claustrophobic?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, the helmet will sense that and stop the experiment.<br/><strong>Colin:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, but that would be cool, wouldn't it?</p>", "6457": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, are you busy?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I've got a subject wired up for a sensory study.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So...?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes, I'm busy.</p>", "6458": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm tracking a subject's brain activity in real time as we introduce olfactory stimuli.<br/><strong>Colin:</strong> I'm smelling baby powder.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's just my husband.</p>", "6459": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I want to see it, but not when I'm in the middle of an experiment.<br/><strong>Colin:</strong> Still baby powder!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Boy, he is annoying. Do any of those buttons shock him?</p>", "6460": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Look, I'm really excited about our paper, too, but I've got a lot of my own work to catch up on, so let's talk later.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, I'll just say one more thing: lambda calculus. And if that wets your whistle, you know where to find me. Boop.</p>", "6461": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You okay? You seem distracted.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm just thinking about Raj.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm thinking about Chris Hemsworth.</p>", "6462": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> He sort of hurt my feelings.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Biceps, hammer, abs. Still in it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why wouldn't he want me to be in his planetarium show?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> And it's gone.</p>", "6463": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sorry, it's just the director of the planetarium thought it'd be fun for me to join Raj for one of his shows, and he made it clear that he didn't want me to.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Of course he wouldn't want you to. I mean, think about it. If you were him, would you want to share the stage with a sexy-ass astronaut?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. How sexy are we talking?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, you know, tight pants, huge biceps, magic hammer.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wait, who are we talk-<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Shh, I'm back in it.</p>", "6464": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The fundamental problem with elementary quantum mechanical formalism is that the Fourier transform extends to minus infinity in time.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, don't dumb this down for me.</p>", "6465": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, Sheldon. Didn't see you there. What's up?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, uh, he was excited to talk science with Amy, but she was working late, so he decided to come over and share it with me. With me, Leonard. With me.</br></p>", "6466": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, we've talked about this. You can't go around boring other people's wives.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. I already got a man for that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, you do.</p>", "6467": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's just, I've just been enjoying my collaboration with Amy, but ever since we got back from our honeymoon, she has so little time.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, she does have her own job.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, but it's so dull. Trying to understand how the brain translates the five senses into biochemical information. I'd rather wait in line without my phone.</p>", "6468": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, well, Leonard's here now. You can talk science with him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where you going?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that thing you were late for. One of us should really be there.</p>", "6469": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I just want to let you know I get why you don't want me to be a part of the planetarium show.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, great. Thanks for stopping by.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You don't want to talk about the stars next to an actual astronaut. That would be like doing karaoke with a rock star.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> First of all, I've totally done karaoke with a rock star. Or are you forgetting when the Spin Doctors handed me the mic at the Orange County Fair?</p>", "6470": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Listen, I understand you being intimidated, but I can't help that I'm proud of being an astronaut. It's a big deal.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, it certainly is, but I also happen to be very accomplished in my field.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Great. So you have no reason to be scared of sharing the spotlight.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Please. I may be scared of heights and spiders and showing up at a costume party that turns out to be a regular party, but I am not scared of sharing the spotlight with you! [Raj walks out, and then reappears]<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What's happening?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I just stormed out for dramatic effect. I- Actually, I don't have anywhere to go.</p>", "6471": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> President Siebert, how much do you know about physics?<br/>\nPresident Sie<strong>Bert:</strong> I'm a physicist.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Huh. I would not have guessed that.<br/>\nPresident Sie<strong>Bert:</strong> I have a doctorate from Indiana University.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that makes more sense. Well, don't worry, I'll go slow.<br/>\nPresident Sie<strong>Bert:</strong> Thank you.</p>", "6472": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Dr. Fowler and I have been working on a theory of super-asymmetry that could reconcile the lack of observation of supersymmetry in a world still governed by string theory.<br/>\nPresident Sie<strong>Bert:</strong> Interesting. So you're taking the paradigms of supersymmetry, but removing the limitations of obeying the Poincare algebra.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, aren't you just the pride of Bloomington?</p>", "6473": "<p>President Sie<strong>Bert:</strong> What do you want, Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Dr. Fowler has found herself distracted by the commitments in her own lab. It would be a great help to both of us if you could free her up from her other projects.<br/>\nPresident Sie<strong>Bert:</strong> I'm confused.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, well, there's that Indiana.</p>", "6474": "<p>President Sie<strong>Bert:</strong> This is physics research. Dr. Fowler's a neuroscientist.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, but her insights into the very ways we conceptualize symmetry and asymmetry have been invaluable.<br/>\nPresident Sie<strong>Bert:</strong> Dr.Cooper-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look, I know what you're thinking, that \"they're newlyweds, how are they gonna keep their hands off of each other?\" Let me assure you, we will not engage in workplace coitus. Okay, if I won't put a bagel on my desk, I'm certainly not putting Amy's bare bottom.</p>", "6475": "<p>President Sie<strong>Bert:</strong> I must say, I do not enjoy our talks.</p>", "6476": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Dr. Park, may I help you?<br/><strong>Dr. Park:</strong> Actually, yes, do you have any better notes on this project? I'm having a hard time reading your handwriting.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, uh, allow me to rephrase that. What the hell are you doing in my lab?</p>", "6477": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Amy, there you are.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, not- Not now, Sheldon, I'm dealing with an epic screwup, and when I find out who's responsible, they're gonna get an earful.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, well, when you're done, let me know, I've got some exciting news.<br/><strong>Dr. Park:</strong> I'm sorry, I'm confused. President Siebert said you were focusing on some important physics work and I should take over your lab in the interim.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, hey, that was my exciting news. All right, I'm gonna tell you again. Pretend you haven't heard it.</p>", "6478": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You got me removed from my own project?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, and it wasn't easy. Apparently, you're very difficult to replace. Hey, just between you and me, they consider Dr. Park quite the step down.<br/><strong>Dr. Park:</strong> I was trying to pick my moment to leave. This seems like it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wow. Banker's hours. No wonder you're not on the tenure track.</p>", "6479": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, you had no right.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What- I thought you said you were spread too thin. You said that you wished you had more time to focus on our research. I thought I was helping.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, you're not. I mean, I have years invested in this work, and now someone's gonna come in and take it over? I mean, how would you feel if I let Leonard take over your super-asymmetry project?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (laughs) That's funny. Oh, he'd be like a puppy with a microscope.</p>", "6480": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> If I had a nickel for every time a charity sent me a nickel.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? That's gonna be our whole life, huh?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If my father's any guide, around 50, I start to lose my hearing and get two new jokes.</br></p>", "6481": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I brought Chinese.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's a nice surprise. What's the occasion?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Please, I don't need a reason to bring food to my friends.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But you have one, don't you?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, I need your help.</p>", "6482": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, I folded, and I told Howard he could be a part of my planetarium show. And now I'm worried he's just gonna make the whole thing about himself.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So just tell him you changed your mind and you don't want him to do it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, no, then he's gonna think I'm too insecure to share the spotlight with him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And he'd be right.</p>", "6483": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I came here for your support.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, then, you just walked up three flights of stairs for nothing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, don't you mean four flights?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, it's actually three.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> But we're on the fourth floor. I mean, you have the lobby, first floor, second, third, fourth.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The lobby's the first floor, so lobby, second, third, fourth.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That does not seem right.</p>", "6484": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, Raj, if I had a nickel for every time a charity sent me a nickel.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> ... That's hilarious!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know.</p>", "6485": "<p>[Penny arrives back in the apartment, out of breath]<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong>  It's three, right?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Just shut up.</p>", "6486": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, good, we caught you.<br/>\nPresident Sie<strong>Bert:</strong> Yes, good.</p>", "6487": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You had no right to reassign my project.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, no right at all.<br/>\nPresident Sie<strong>Bert:</strong> Dr. Fowler, I don't understand. Dr. Cooper assured me this is what you wanted.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh-oh! Can you believe this guy? Oh, sure, so a couple of men get together behind closed doors to decide the fate of a woman's career. I thought we'd moved past this.</p>", "6488": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, this is your fault.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ooh, sounds like the old lady's putting me in the doghouse tonight.</p>", "6489": "<p>President Sie<strong>Bert:</strong> Dr. Fowler, you are very important to this university and I would like to sincerely apologize.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So I can have my project back?<br/>\nPresident Sie<strong>Bert:</strong> I'm afraid it's not that simple.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why not?<br/>\nPresident Sie<strong>Bert:</strong> Well, in order to free up personnel-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, hey, don't go mansplaining things to her.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't think that's what he was doing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, then perhaps you don't understand. See, mansplaining is when a man explains things to a woman like she's stupid. Boop.</p>", "6490": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So when was the last time you saw Howard in his astronaut uniform?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> About a week ago.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? What was the occasion?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Date night. We do a little role-playing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What role do you play?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (Russian accent) I am Ykatarina Nazdorovya, lonely Russian cosmonaut who is expert at physics and making love.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, that just made the next hour really weird.</p>", "6491": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Good evening, I am Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and usually I take you on a trip through the stars, but tonight, we'll begin our journey much closer to home, 220 miles straight up to the International Space Station, which is manned by a team of brave men and women.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (Russian accent) Flexible men and women.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> [to Leonard] Switch with me.</p>", "6492": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> And we are fortunate to have one of those men here with us tonight. Please welcome to the Griffith Observatory astronaut Howard Joel Wolowitz.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> [fanning herself with the program] Kak horosho.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What is she ta-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Don't ask.</p>", "6493": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Thank you, Raj, that was a really nice introduction.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, it's from my heart. So, Howard, you are in an elite group. Only 232 people have ever been on the International Space Station. How does that make you feel?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Honestly, lucky. Most astronauts have to train their whole lives. I was just in the right place at the right time.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, please, luck had nothing to do with it. You people need to know how impressive this man is. He was up there because he's the only one qualified to install a piece of equipment that he designed.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thanks, but if you want to talk impressive, this guy right here discovered a planetary object outside the Kuiper belt.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> He worked on the Mars rover.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> He helped launch the New Horizons space probe.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> He went to space on a Russian rocket.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And I was scared the whole time.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And I was scared for you, but also proud.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wow. I don't think you've ever said that to me before.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I should have, and I'm gonna say it again. I'm proud of you. You're my best friend, and I love you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Aw, Raj, I love you, too.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What is happening?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Bring it in, spaceman, you've been cleared for landing.</p>", "6494": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Can you believe these two?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (crying)<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Are you crying?</p>", "6495": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Hello, Sheldon.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, Arthur. Now, I'm confused, usually when you appear to me in my dreams, we're on the planet Dagobah.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> This is Dagobah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I didn't know that Dagobah had delicatessens.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Not good ones. Whatever you do, don't order the Reuben.</br></p>", "6496": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm having a problem in my marriage. I've upset my wife and I don't know how to make it right.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> (chuckles) And you're and you're coming to me for advice? I-I upset my wife every time I woke up in the morning.</p>", "6497": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not coming to you, you're just a manifestation of my subconscious. I mean, I'm actually coming to me.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> So you know everything I'm going to say.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, but it sounds wiser from you because you're old and glowing.</p>", "6498": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Rule number one in a marriage: don't go to bed angry.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That makes sense.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Rule number two in a marriage: if you don't recognize the shoes under your bed, they're not your shoes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because they're her shoes?<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> (sighs) N-Never mind, just-just go with rule number one.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you, Arthur.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Uh, before you go, can I ask you a question?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Does this look lean to you? I ordered lean.</p>", "6499": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy. Wake up. Amy.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What? What's wrong?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We can't go to sleep angry with each other.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's rule number one. I'd tell you rule number two, but it's confusing.</p>", "6500": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, go to sleep.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy. [tapping her three times] Amy. [tapping her three times]  Amy. [tapping her three times] <br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You cut that out!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, good, you're up.</p>", "6501": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, Professor Proton came to me in my dream and said we can't go to sleep angry.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you sure that's what he said? Close your eyes, double-check.</p>", "6502": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, listen to me. I love working with you, but you have to understand how scary this is for me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Because I don't want to get lost in this relationship. And when you pulled me off my project, it seemed like my biggest fear was coming true, the-the things that are mine are getting subsumed into the things that are ours.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I wouldn't want that to happen, either. Thank you for explaining, and for using the word \"subsume,\" that's one you don't hear enough.</p>", "6503": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What are you doing now?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Looking for shoes.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When your favorite ghost tells you to do something, you do it.</p>", "6504": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh. You got an e-mail from someone named Tam.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Tam? What does he want?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Uh, looks like he's coming to give his son a tour of Caltech. He's hoping you guys can meet up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (scoffs) He would like that, wouldn't he?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, that is the gist of the e-mail.</p>", "6505": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So, are you actually engaged to this woman you just met?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Tell us the truth. Did she get you pregnant?</p>", "6506": "<p><strong>Anu:</strong> [on the phone] Okay, I got you two seats to Hamilton tonight. Your tickets will be at the concierge desk. Of course. My pleasure. [to Bernadette and Penny] May I help you?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yes, I'm here to pick up our Hamilton tickets.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Stop.</p>", "6507": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hi. We're Raj's friends. I'm Penny. This is Bernadette. We just came by to introduce ourselves.<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> So you came to check me out?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> She's smart. I like her.</p>", "6508": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> We just want to see if we could take you to dinner and get to know you a bit.<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> That sounds nice. How about tonight after work? Maybe we can go to Bavel.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I wish. That place is impossible to get into.<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> Oh, please. Getting into impossible places is my superpower.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Me, too. I can fit my whole body in our dryer.</p>", "6509": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What is going on with you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't want to talk about it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I'm sure you have a perfectly stupid reason.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't do anything for a stupid reason. Except, perhaps, Talk Like a Pirate Day, and I'd argue that's more whimsical than stupid.</p>", "6510": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Be careful, Sheldon. I don't think you can afford to lose a second best friend.<br>\nI don't see anyone lining up to be your third.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> D- Wait. [typing] \"Snarky comebacks\" Oh, here we go. \"You have your entire life to be a jerk, why not take today off?\" That was harsh, but he was asking for it.</br></p>", "6511": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Look, I think that's LeBron over there.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> James?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, LeBron Kershenbaum.</p>", "6512": "<p><strong>Anu:</strong> So, what do you want to know?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, you seem like a smart, successful woman, why would you want to marry someone you just met?<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> Fair question. In my 20s, I tried this the normal way. You know, met a guy, fell in love, we moved in together. I put him through culinary school, screenwriting classes, and finally dumped him when he wanted to become a midwife. Then I realized, my parents are happy; they had an arranged marriage. Why am I fighting this?</p>", "6513": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So what is the craziest request anyone's ever made?<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> Oh, you know, I can't really say. Concierge-guest confidentiality.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really, that's a thing?<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> (laughs) No. This one time, I had to go to Walmart at 3:00 a.m. because Britney Spears needed to blow bubbles.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh. That is so cool. By the way, do not tell Raj that you met Britney Spears, because he will literally die.</p>", "6514": "<p><strong>Anu:</strong> We've been talking so much about me, tell me about Raj.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, are you trying to get us drunk so we'll dish on our friend?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> 'Cause it's totally gonna work, what do you want to know?</p>", "6515": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> He also cries every time Hugh Jackman sings.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> But not cute sniffles, full-on snot sobs.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> But he is great.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So great.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah.</p>", "6516": "<p><strong>Tam:</strong> Sheldon, I needed to stay in Texas. And you needed to come here. I knew you were gonna do amazing things, and meet amazing people who were gonna respect you, because you're brilliant. And because they never had to fish you out of a dumpster.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, they have, but it was during my short-lived parkour phase.</p>", "6517": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sounds like Penny and Bernadette had fun last night.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I know. Bernie came home pretty drunk. She tried to sleep in the dryer.</p>", "6518": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What the hell did you two say to Anu?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Uh, whatever do you mean?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why, why would you tell her I wear ladies' deodorant?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, because you're a boy and it's really funny.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, oh, okay. Pardon me for having the confidence to smell daisy-fresh.</p>", "6519": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Ugh, God, now I feel bad.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I know. Maybe we should take her out again and do some damage control.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, that's a good idea. Think she can get us into SoHo House?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't know, but we owe it to Raj to try.</p>", "6520": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> The same thing happened to me. Penny said she didn't want kids, and I told her she was being silly, and she accused me of being condescending. Which is crazy, because if I wanted to be condescending, I would've said, \"Ooh, 'condescending.' That's such a big word.\"</p>", "6521": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Why won't our friends just listen to us? We obviously know what we're talking about.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I know. We're married, we have great kids, great jobs, this great house. [\"Smooth Operator\" starts playing in Stuart's room again]</p>", "6522": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, Leonard, remember yesterday when we were talking about having kids someday? Yeah? Well, what if it wasn't someday.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, my God. Oh, my God, are you pregnant?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No. No. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.</p>", "6523": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey. Mind if I sit?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Did you just come here to tell me I'm making a gigantic mistake by having this blueberry muffin and I should've got a cinnamon roll like you did?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Good, 'cause I'm happy with my choice. Although that cinnamon roll does smell good if you're open to halfsies.</p>", "6524": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, Howard.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It looks like you could crack a walnut in those glutes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I can't. I tried.</p>", "6525": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I made you dinner. Your favorite: In-N-Out Burger out of the wrapper on a plate.</br></p>", "6526": "<p><strong>Anu:</strong> I told my parents our first date went well and they got very excited.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, tell me about it. My parents were so thrilled, they actually spoke to each other. So that was a disaster.</p>", "6527": "<p><strong>Anu:</strong> Raj. I know we don't know each other very well, but you seem like you'd make a good father and you're tall enough so I can wear heels and I think that's something worth fighting for. Will you marry me?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (stammering) Oh, my God, oh, my God. Yes, of course, of course I'll marry you!<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> If you'd like to kiss me you can.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, great.<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> I should warn you I have a tongue piercing.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, you're not that nice. (laughs)</p>", "6528": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you gonna tell me where we're going? Because if it has the words \"farmers\" or \"market\" in it, I don't want to go.</p>", "6529": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You were talking about all the things you thought you would never have, so I thought I would get you one.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, my God. You bought me the Batmobile?!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No. No. No, no, no, no, no. I rented you the Batmobile for the day.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> This is amazing. Thank you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Be careful. I did not get the insurance.</p>", "6530": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So, Penny, we were talking to our neighbors, and they're thinking of moving and selling their house.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? Why?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Something about babies crying and keeping them up all night; it's not important. You guys should totally take a look at it.</p>", "6531": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> How are you two married?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You were there. I wore her down.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> He did.</p>", "6532": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You guys should've talked about all this stuff while you were dating. I mean, me and Anu already know so much about each other.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Wait, I forget, is Anu your waxer?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, no, that's Annette. Anu is the woman my father fixed me up with. We're going on our first date tomorrow. Which reminds me, I need to see Annette.</p>", "6533": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How do you feel about this?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That she can clearly do better, but that's not for me to say.</p>", "6534": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How do you feel about children?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Um, they're okay, I guess. I mean, if I saw one, I wouldn't throw a rock at it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why would you throw a rock at a child?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (chuckles) I just said I wouldn't.</p>", "6535": "<p><strong>Anu:</strong> Excuse me. Can we please get sparkling instead of tap, some clean silverware and find out what they're having? That looks delicious.<br/><strong>Waiter:</strong> Yes, ma'am.<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> Thank you. So, you're an astrophysicist?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes, ma'am. I-I mean, uh, just yes. U-Unless you prefer \"ma'am.\"<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> I don't.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Good, because you don't seem like a ma'am. You seem more like a sweet thang.<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> Wow. You are not good at this.</p>", "6536": "<p><strong>Anu:</strong> Look, your whole sweet, insecure thing is cute, but honestly, I have no time for that. If you're not serious about this, you need to walk away now.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I-I am serious.<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> Good.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay. (chuckles) Okay, what does this mean?<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> I think it means I might be the future Mrs. -<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Koothrappali.<br/><strong>Anu:</strong> How would you feel if I didn't change my name?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> A little hurt, but you wouldn't know, because I'm too nice.</p>", "6537": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I think, by the end of the honeymoon, we really started to feel like a married couple.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> But the good kind, like on TV, not like my parents.</p>", "6538": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You're not a real married couple until you can pee with the door open and she's okay with it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I told you, I'm not okay with it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She loves it.</p>", "6539": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> \"I heart New York.\" Aw, the baby's gonna love throwing up on this.</p>", "6540": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, guys, that was very, very thoughtful of you. Did you get me a double XL?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> I told you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You were right, dear.</br></p>", "6541": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh. Isn't this nice?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What is it?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, it's, uh, it's one of those- Nope, doesn't do that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, maybe it's candy. Lick it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't want to lick it. You lick it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not gonna lick it. I just brushed my teeth.</p>", "6542": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Is it from one of your dumb sci-fi shows?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, none of the sci-fi shows I watch are dumb.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, Westworld. But this has nothing to do with that show, other than it's also inexplicable.</p>", "6543": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What is wrong with Stuart's face?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I think he's smiling.</p>", "6544": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, my God, are they flirting?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, they're way past flirting. I caught them making out at Sheldon's wedding.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Are you sure she wasn't trying to breathe life back into him?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't think so. When I used that much tongue at CPR training, I had to buy the dummy.</p>", "6545": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So, what's her deal? Is she into you or does she just hate her parents?</p>", "6546": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> We kissed a little at the wedding, and it was great. But we haven't really talked about it since then. So I-I don't know how she feels about me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, she patted you on the head, so I'm guessing she feels like you're such a good boy!</p>", "6547": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Maybe we're trying too hard. Maybe it's something simple.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (gasps) Like Leonard and Penny. Yes, good.</p>", "6548": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm just gonna ask them.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, you can't; it'll hurt their feelings.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm okay with that.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And they'll know you weren't smart enough to figure it out on your own.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're right. Oh, this is awful. And I can't even comfort myself by stroking the fossilized tibia of a Pentaceratops.</p>", "6549": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> If there's a chance someone's gonna see you naked, it's also polite to make sure you're well-groomed down there.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I get it, Howard. I've been busy!</p>", "6550": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> He's never gonna figure it out.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> [outside the apartment] What are you?!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Gosh, this makes me happy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah.</p>", "6551": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Leonard, thank you again. We love the gift.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aw. [After Sheldon leaves] Does he know what it is?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, not even close. He thinks it's a clue to a scavenger hunt.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (laughs) So, so happy.</p>", "6552": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hey, Raj, will you, um, smell something for me?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, that depends. Actually, it doesn't depend. Just no.</p>", "6553": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I really like Denise, and I don't want to screw this up.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, relax. Trust your instincts. That's what I do.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> And that works for you?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Actually no. I've made a mess of my life, and I'm - I'm all alone.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> [silence] Okay, I think it'd be best for both of us if I pretend to get a phone call and just walk away.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, that would be best.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> [picking up his phone] Hello, this is Stuart. (whispering) Sorry. I got to take this. (walking away) Uh, why, yes, I'd love to take a survey.</p>", "6554": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, look, I asked the barista if anyone left anything for us, and she said to look in this lost and found box.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But why would it be in the lost and found box?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Because we were lost, and then we found each other.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It makes perfect sense.</p>", "6555": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, and look at this. A locket. And that stone in front, I bet it's quartz.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This must be it. This must be the actual gift. Open it up. What's inside?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Nothing. It's empty.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course. Our life together is just starting, and they want us to fill it with our memories.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> This might be the best wedding gift ever.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (gasps) They also left us a pair of sunglasses because our future's so bright!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> They thought of everything!</br></p>", "6556": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I was worried about the date so I got my hair colored to make me feel a little more confident, but that just made me look paler, so I-I got a spray tan.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Have you tried showering, seeing if you could scrub it off?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I did. You're gonna need some new towels. And a bathmat. And a toilet seat.</p>", "6557": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> All right. Let me ask you a question. What do you think of this woman?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh. Oh, my God, she's beautiful. Is that who you're going to set me up with?<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> No! That's who I'm dating. But maybe she has an older sister.</p>", "6558": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So we put a little picture of me and a little picture of Sheldon in it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> In-in the locket?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That was in a lost and found box?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Exactly.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Where we hid it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So really, you gave us three amazing gifts. You gave the locket, the adventure and the realization that Amy and I can do anything as long as we work together.</p>", "6559": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I almost forgot. While you were sleeping, I ordered room service.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Voila! You thought it was going to be food, didn't you?</p>", "6560": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Is it nice having Sheldon and Amy away on their honeymoon?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, because now Leonard and I get all this alone time.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> But you're not alone. We're here.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes. (sighs) Yes, you are.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Would you like us to leave so you and Leonard can talk about all the things you have in common?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ha, ha, she called your bluff.</p>", "6561": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, something pretty cool happened. Channel 3 asked me to be on the news tomorrow night to talk about the meteor shower.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, that's great.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey-<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Congratulations.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, that's how Neil deGrasse Tyson got his start. He went from the Hayden Planetarium to guesting on the local news to ruining everyone's favorite movies on the Internet.</p>", "6562": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> They're not; they just posted a picture in front of the Statue of Liberty.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Real or Lego?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Lego.</p>", "6563": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So, what should we do? Should someone go check it out?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I would, but I got to be on TV tomorrow. Got to protect the money.</p>", "6564": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, uh, Mr. Fowler. Sorry, we didn't know you were here. We actually thought someone was breaking in.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And we were ready to take them down.<br/><strong>Mr. Fowler:</strong> Amy asked me to water her plants.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> She doesn't have any plants.<br/><strong>Mr. Fowler:</strong> Oh. Well, you caught me in a lie. Have a good day.</p>", "6565": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, did you even see Mamma Mia 1?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Didn't need to. The sequel stands on its own.</p>", "6566": "<p><strong>Bellman:</strong> If you need any recommendations while visiting New York, please don't hesitate to contact me.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, it is our honeymoon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So we are going to be quite busy.<br/><strong>Bellman:</strong> Got it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Harry Potter play, parts one and two.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And tomorrow, a tour of the sites where Nikola Tesla lived, worked and slowly went crazy. And, of course, coitus.<br/><strong>Bellman:</strong> Ah. Well, enjoy New York. And, I guess, coitus.</p>", "6567": "<p><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> Larry, come on.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't think he's in there. I mean, he came by to water the imaginary plants, but then he left.<br/><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> You are so naive. Blondie here is gonna chew you up and spit you out.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, don't tell him.</p>", "6568": "<p><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> Oh, he's in here. I can smell his Axe body spray.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He wears Axe body spray.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You happy? You smell like Amy's dad.</p>", "6569": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, come on.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ah, shouldn't we mind our own business?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, sometimes it's like you don't know me at all.</p>", "6570": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Man, that is one hot weather girl.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> How come if I say that I get in trouble?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You want to say it? You can say it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Nice try. You're gonna have to find some other way to not have sex with me tonight. And it's not weather girl, it's weather woman.</br></p>", "6571": "<p><strong>Sunny Morrow:</strong> And with us today to talk about the upcoming meteor shower and the best places to view it, Caltech astrophysicist Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali. Thank you for being here.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you for having me. I guess Neil deGrasse Tyson was unavailable.<br/><strong>Sunny Morrow:</strong> (laughs) Yeah.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What do you mean, \"yeah\"?<br/><strong>Sunny Morrow:</strong> Not important. So, what can we expect to see from this meteor shower?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I think you can count on a lot of flaming gas, which is what you would have gotten from your first choice, Neil deGrasse Tyson.</p>", "6572": "<p><strong>Sunny Morrow:</strong> Sounds like there's no love lost between you and Dr. Tyson.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, no, I love Neil. I mean, not as much as Neil loves Neil, but who does, right?</p>", "6573": "<p><strong>Sunny Morrow:</strong> Oh, you know, I'm told we are out of time, (chuckles) having learned nothing about meteor showers and too much about Dr. Koothrappali.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you.</p>", "6574": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you know what I love about Broadway theater? It's so interactive.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Uh-huh.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're so close to the actors. It's like you're in the play.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Uh-huh.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I mean, you yell, \"Harry, watch out,\" he looks right at you. And not just Harry, everyone onstage.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> At the risk of sounding redundant, uh-huh.</p>", "6575": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, well, it's a bit late, but I did block out the rest of the evening for conjugal relations. Should we shower? I mean before, not during. That's how you fall and break a hip.</p>", "6576": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, do we really have to do this on a schedule?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you suggesting spontaneity?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I guess, yeah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, now that we're married, sex can occur at any time? Like, we can be brushing our teeth, and suddenly your minty-fresh tongue is in my mouth? No, thank you.</p>", "6577": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Where are you going?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, to take a shower. Now that sex can happen at any time, I always have to be ready. Should probably live under a waterfall.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, you don't have to worry about sex happening tonight.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Well, thanks, but I'm still gonna rinse off. I touched a lot of stuff in the gift shop.</p>", "6578": "<p><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> No message, no note. Who would do that? What kind of husband would-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If you let him talk, maybe you'll find out.<br/><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> Fine. Larry?<br/>\n*Mr. Fowler shrugs his shoulders*<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, there you go. What more can he say?</p>", "6579": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I know, really, what did he ever see in her? He's so, so sweet, and she's such a ballbuster.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Some guys think strong women are sexy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, but they seem to have nothing in common.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, well, sometimes opposites attract.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, are you saying we are like them?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know, maybe a little.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So you're the sweet, quiet one and I'm Amy's mom? Is that what you're saying?<br/>\n*Leonard shrugs his shoulders*</p>", "6580": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, check out what Neil deGrasse Tyson just tweeted. \"I've been informed that some random, attention-seeking nobody took a cheap shot at me on the local news.\" That's me. Guys, he's talking about me!</p>", "6581": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Raj, you need to apologize to Dr. Tyson.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why? This could be good for me. Everybody loves a good Twitter feud. Neil and I could be like the new, uh, Katy Perry and Taylor Swift.</p>", "6582": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Come on, Raj, you're better than this.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, leave room for dessert 'cause I'm gonna make you eat those words.</p>", "6583": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> (clears throat) \"Dear Dr. Tyson, \"much like epithelial tissue, it appears I've gotten under your skin.\" iPhone drop, but I won't 'cause I don't have AppleCare.</p>", "6584": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What'd he say?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> \"Nice try, genius. The skin is epithelial tissue.\" Oh, it's on. He's Katy, I'm T-Swift.</p>", "6585": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Just let it go.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is everything all right? You seem testy this morning.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm not testy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll have to take your word for it. There's no test for testy.</br></p>", "6586": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is it possible that you're sexually frustrated?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, now I'm testy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you had adhered to my coital schedule, your brain would be floating on a sea of oxytocin right now.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Don't talk to me about my brain. I'm a neurobiologist.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Then you should know the benefits of the special hug that grown-ups give each other.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, everybody's listening.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course they're listening; we're interesting.</p>", "6587": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm only recently married. Do I stay here? Do I follow? Say something useful.</p>", "6588": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Morning, sunshine. So I see you're making espresso.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yup. Just need that extra jolt for a successful day of ballbusting.</p>", "6589": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mrs. Fowler is an angry, vindictive woman, whereas you are warm and-and loving, quick to forgive.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, please.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm serious. And I'm nothing like Amy's dad. He's a mousy little man who can't stand up for himself.<br/>\n*Penny stares at Leonard*<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> My point is you're not like her, so we're not like them.</p>", "6590": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, 30 years from now, are you gonna hide from me because I'm so scary?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, I don't think you're scary. Yes, I flinch when you make sudden moves, but that says more about my childhood than you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aw.<br/>\n*Penny goes to huge Leonard, he flinches and backs away. He recovers and hugs her.*</p>", "6591": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hang on, I'm checking to see if Neil replied to my latest smackdown.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Really? Don't you think this Twitter feud is a little silly?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Absolutely not. It's two respected scientists debating opposing views in a public forum.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You called him Mike Tyson's little sister.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, and now Mike Tyson's mad at me, too.</p>", "6592": "<p><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> He said he needs a break, and I'm too much for him.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. I'm sure he didn't mean that.<br/><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> He said I'm overbearing!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, please, you're just the right amount of bearing. Look, I know he loves you. If you just give him some space, I'm sure he'll come back.<br/><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> You really think so?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I do.<br/><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> You're a good person, Penny. I hope we get to spend lots of time together.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Me, too.</p>", "6593": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hit the road.<br/><strong>Mr. Fowler:</strong> But-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Now!<br/><strong>Mr. Fowler:</strong> Can I get my stuff?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Be quick about it!</p>", "6594": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Go for Dr. K.<br/><strong>Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson:</strong> Is this Rajesh Koothrappali?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes. Who is this?<br/><strong>Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson:</strong> Neil deGrasse Tyson.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (stammers) Uh, wow. (chuckles) How fun is this Twitter thing, huh?<br/><strong>Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson:</strong> You think you're funny?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm not Seinfeld funny, but I did an open mic night once.<br/><strong>Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson:</strong> You're not funny.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, that's what they said at the Chuckle Hut.<br/><strong>Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson:</strong> How about this, I've got a book signing at Vroman's in Pasadena next week. Why don't you come by and say some of those things to my face?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (chuckles) Oh, no, but thanks for the invite.<br/><strong>Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson:</strong> Smart move, and the next time you pick up your phone, remember, I'm the guy who kicked Pluto out of the solar system.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And it deserved it, sir. Thank you. Bye-bye.</p>", "6595": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm gonna need everyone's help. Think of this as one of your comic book movies. There's a bunch of superheroes, each with a different task.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, like the new Avengers.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Which one was that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The one you slept through last weekend.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, that was a good nap.</p>", "6596": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, Mr. Fowler, are you okay back there? Do you need more air?<br/><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> He's fine.</p>", "6597": "<p><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> I'm surprised Amy didn't pick us up.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, well, you know, she's pretty busy the day before her wedding.<br/><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> Too busy for her mother? She used to be such a devoted daughter. Now she's just waiting for me to die so she can get my china.</p>", "6598": "<p><strong>Mary:</strong> You'll have to excuse her. She's just pregnant and hormonal.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, yeah, congratulations on baby number two.<br/><strong>Missy:</strong> Yeah. Whoopie.</p>", "6599": "<p><strong>Mary:</strong> Her husband would be here, but he stayed home to watch their older son, so e-everything's fine!<br/><strong>Missy:</strong> Stop it. We're separated.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You don't say?</p>", "6600": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> It's so nice to meet you.<br><strong>Missy:</strong> \u00adAw.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I've always wanted a sister.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? Why?<br/><strong>Missy:</strong> I love you, too, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? Why?</br></p>", "6601": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What the hell is that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Come on, you know this one. It's a dog. I found him in the backyard. And don't worry, I already called the owner.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Good, 'cause we don't need a dog. We already have two babies, you and Stuart.</p>", "6602": "<p>*Howard answers his front door*<br/><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm gonna need a minute. [closes the door] That's Mark Hamill!</p>", "6603": "<p><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> Anyway, thanks so much. I-I want to give you a reward for finding him.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (chuckles) Oh, no, I couldn't take your money. It's just an honor to meet you.<br/><strong>Mark Hamill:</strong> No. No, please. You don't know what this dog means to me, and I thought he was gone for good. Please? There must be something I can do for you. Anything.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, you're gonna regret that.</p>", "6604": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, you're awfully quiet. Are you okay?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. I was thinking about string theory. But catch me up.<br/><strong>Mrs. Fowler:</strong> What'd I miss? Are you seeing this, Larry? These are the people I'm gonna have to live with after you're dead.</p>", "6605": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> W-What is he doing here?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I found his dog and guilted him into officiating the wedding. Don't tell Sheldon. It's a surprise.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wait, I-I thought Wil was officiating the wedding.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, so did he.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How did he take the news?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'll let you know.</p>", "6606": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Everyone's waiting. What are you guys doing?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Super asymmetry.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Super asymmetry? Is that a thing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We're inventing it right now.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't you think this can wait until - Hold on. This is interesting.</p>", "6607": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard. That's Mark Ha-Ha-Ha. It's-it's Mark Hami-Ha-Ha-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yep. Thank Wolowitz. He set it up.</p>", "6608": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Look, he may have been mean to you when you were kids, but you're both grown men now.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's right. I'm a grown-up, and if I don't want to invite him to my wedding, then I won't.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Except I have to 'cause my mommy's making me.</p>", "6609": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How many out-of-town guests are there gonna be?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm actually not sure. Turns out Sheldon didn't invite his brother.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mm. Now it's starting to sound like a wedding.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And his mom said she won't come if his brother's not there.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong>  Ooh, now it's starting to sound like a good wedding.</p>", "6610": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, Bernie. Hey, how do you know if someone has pink eye?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Um, their eye would be red, swollen and probably oozy.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, thanks. Both kids have pink eye.</p>", "6611": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I got to find a date. I don't want to be that sad single friend that everyone looks at with pity.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, I'm-I'm afraid that ship may have sailed.</p>", "6612": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, you have a brother, right?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is he the worst? Is he an unspeakable abomination? Does the very thought of him make your skin crawl?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, he laughs at his own jokes, but otherwise he's okay.</p>", "6613": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> [on the plane with Sheldon to Texas] I kept saying no. H-H-How am I here?</p>", "6614": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Aren't you worried it's a little intense to ask someone you just met to go to a wedding?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (sighs) I'm running out of time. Wh-Wh-Why can't there be a service where you can just pay someone to be your date for the evening?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Like an escort service?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, no, no. Y-You wouldn't be paying for sex. I mean, obviously if things went well, it could lead to sex, but, but the money is for, like, you know, her time and companionship.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, I get it an escort service.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Stop saying that.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Stop meaning it.</p>", "6615": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, wait, y-your brother is Dr. Tire?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, and, apparently, it only takes half a semester of community college to get that particular doctorate.</br></p>", "6616": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, excuse me. Uh, we're looking for a Georgie Cooper.<br/><strong>Margaret:</strong> One second, I'll check to see if the doctor's in.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He is not a doctor. (scoffs) There's only one doctor here and it's me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm also a doctor.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you want to wait in the car?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I wanted to wait in California.</p>", "6617": "<p><strong>Georgie:</strong> What do you want, Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why aren't you returning my phone calls?<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> You're supposed to be the smart one; you figure it out.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He's not that kind of smart. You might want to give him a hint.</p>", "6618": "<p><strong>Georgie:</strong> We haven't talked in over ten years, and now that you need something, you think you can just show up at my store? Well, let's just drop everything to accommodate Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nice try, but I am not a gullible little boy anymore. I can recognize sarcasm.<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> Okay. You're right. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry. Tell me what you need. Your wish is my command.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's better, thank you.</p>", "6619": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> [answering video call, seeing Bernadette's case of pinkeye] Oh, my God.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, I got it, too.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow. You really can't keep your hands off Howard, can you?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I know, I have a problem.</p>", "6620": "<p><strong>Georgie:</strong> Hold up. I-I'm confused. You didn't want me at your wedding, but now that Mom won't come, you want me there.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know you don't hear this a lot, but that is exactly right. Good job.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not helping, Sheldon.</p>", "6621": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is all Georgie's fault. My whole childhood, he was mean to me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sorry. I know what it's like to live with a bully.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Your brother bullied you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I was talking about Penny, but sure, yeah.</p>", "6622": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We're so sorry we ruined your date.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, boo-hoo. His date got ruined. I'm about to get married, and look at me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It looks like it's getting better.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, does it? Does it look like that with your two clear eyes?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm sorry. Are you mad that I don't have pink eye?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What do you think?</p>", "6623": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wow. That was impressive.<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> Yeah. Well, it's easy when you love your product and hate Tony Romo.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (laughs) Yeah, that guy's the - Actually, I don't, I don't know who that guy is.</p>", "6624": "<p><strong>Georgie:</strong> You have no idea what you are talking about.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ooh, there. That, that was very Sheldon.</p>", "6625": "<p><strong>Georgie:</strong> Come on. He was still gonna get beat up for wearing that dress.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, didn't you sit on his head while he tried to watch Star Trek?<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> Well, yeah, but that was hilarious.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That is pretty hilarious, yeah.</p>", "6626": "<p><strong>Georgie:</strong> Look, I mean, I always looked out for him at school. I drove him everywhere. I apologized to people when he was rude.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. I've done all that. I've also removed all the red balloons from his Lucky Charms because they weren't \"Irish enough\".</p>", "6627": "<p><strong>Georgie:</strong> Leonard, you want a beer?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, I would love a beer.<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> There you go.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thanks. Can you open it for me?<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> No, it's a twist-off.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know.</p>", "6628": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey! I got all the beads to the other side.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's not a puzzle, Penny.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you really want to be touching that? Do you know how many sick kids? You know, never mind. Knock yourself out.</p>", "6629": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have nothing to apologize for.<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> (scoffs) I told you this was a bad idea. Sometimes you can't patch a tire. You just got to buy a new one. Actually, that's always the case. Never patch, buy new.</p>", "6630": "<p><strong>Georgie:</strong> You went away to college after Dad died. Who do you think took care of everything?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mom did. Mom always took care of everything.<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> Mom was a mess, Missy was a dumb teenager. I had to look after both of 'em.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I talked to Mom all the time. If she was upset, she would have told me.<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> She was protecting you, you idiot, just like everyone always does.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If things were bad, then why didn't you tell me?<br/><strong>Georgie:</strong> Because I was protecting you, too. (sighs) You're my baby brother, Sheldon. I know life has been hard for you, but that don't mean it's been easy for the rest of us.</br></p>", "6631": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why aren't you looking at the camera?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, you know, I'm just working on my peripheral vision.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that is nonsense. Your peripheral vision is fine. Are those women's magazines making you feel bad about yourself again?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yup, that is what's happening.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have told you before, those women are airbrushed to make it look like they have good vision.</p>", "6632": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, I-I was thinking, now that you and your brother made up, there's no reason to rush home. Maybe you and Leonard could, could stay for, uh [looking at her eye-drops] two to three more fun-filled days there.</p>", "6633": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, Leonard, good news. We do have time to visit the Museum of the American Railroad!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'd say no, but what's the point?</p>", "6634": "<p><strong>Jenna:</strong> You might not want to get too close. Pink eye.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Me, too! Bacterial?<br/><strong>Jenna:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Same! (laughs) I-I know this is gonna sound crazy, but would you be interested in going to a wedding with me?</p>", "6635": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, so each welcome bag gets a schedule of events, a map, and chocolate from me. And from Sheldon, a bottle of Purell, the number for Poison Control in case someone accidentally drinks the Purell, and a laminated table of elements because the American school system is a failure.</p>", "6636": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> There aren't gonna be any wedding photos. My fiancee's a germophobe. If he finds out I'm contagious, he'll never come back from Texas.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What if we tell him the theme of the wedding is Walking Dead and this is our zombie makeup?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That'll probably work. We'll call that plan B.</p>", "6637": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It is fitting that you got into tires, because you are tiresome.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, come on.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Was that too mean?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, not too mean, not too good either.</p>", "6638": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> My mother wouldn't approve; shows too much clavicle. She calls it \"the bosom's welcome mat.\"</p>", "6639": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> In order to corroborate your string theory research, you'd have to create a black hole. Wouldn't that destroy the Earth?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perhaps, but we'd all go to the grave knowing I was right.</p>", "6640": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What-what are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The light is red so I came to a stop.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're in a stolen cop car with a dead hooker in the trunk. You don't have to obey traffic laws.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know I don't have to. The fun is choosing to.</p>", "6641": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I guess you could create a contained microscopic black hole.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Huh. Interesting. Welcome back, Leonard. Sorry, you're out.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What did I do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Exactly.</p>", "6642": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But while we're on the subject of fashion, I'm asking the university for some funding tomorrow.<br/>\nWhat should I wear?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mm. Well, I've got a push-up bra I can loan you that always gets me free drinks.</p>", "6643": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong>  What do you need that kind of money for?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have figured out an experimental design that may corroborate my latest thinking on string theory. I just need 2,148 high-power lasers to compress 20 micrograms of gold into a small enough volume to make a microscopic black hole.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> [seeing Penny's incomprehension] Just nod.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mmm.</p>", "6644": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> He said no?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. That's only a two letter word. You're gonna have to double down.</p>", "6645": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon, but this sort of thing happens. Higgs had to wait almost 50 years before they built a collider big enough to prove his theory.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> 50 years? But I want to play with it now.</br></p>", "6646": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not waiting for the university to come around. I'll find another way to raise the money.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ooh, if it's one of those booths where we can throw a pie at you, I'm in for, like, 20 bucks.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> 40 bucks if I can throw a DVD player.</p>", "6647": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Little finger sandwiches, too. This place is amazing.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Interesting thing about finger sandwiches: you put enough of them together, you got a sandwich.</p>", "6648": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Should I try on some more?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Are you having fun?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Am I having fun being beautiful? Of course I am!</p>", "6649": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> This is it. This is the one. Do you love it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Do you?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I do.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Also, wow.</p>", "6650": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, that was a successful trip.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes. Amy found a dress that she liked.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> She sure did. She found a dress that looked like like it made her happy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong>  She-she did look happy. I mean, her face was just glowing, so-<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, we should make sure the photographer knows to just really get in there.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mm. So we agree it's awful?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That dress should be set on fire!</p>", "6651": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, what about my dress? Don't you like it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's beautiful.</p>", "6652": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Okay, well, you know, I'm gonna have to open it to assess its condition.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just be gentle. It's never felt the touch of a man before.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> You don't seem like you really want to sell these.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course I don't want to sell these. These are all important to me, but not as important as science, and if this is the sacrifice I need to make, then so be it.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Okay. Uh, why don't you leave these here with me, and I'll-I'll price 'em out for you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is it okay if I stand here and watch?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> [running out of the store] If anyone asks, tell them I was brave.</p>", "6653": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, I can't believe you just threw me under the bus.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I know, right? That was crazy.</p>", "6654": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's so frustrating that science should be held hostage to the almighty dollar.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, don't give up. You'll find that money somewhere.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You really think so?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, but it's good that he has a hobby.</p>", "6655": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You ever thought of going to Vegas?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can you be more specific?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Las Vegas?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, you mean gambling.</p>", "6656": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that's not the worst idea.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Um, it is the worst idea, and I'm including the year that Raj wore nothing but tracksuits.</p>", "6657": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> [answering the phone] Hello?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I feel bad about hanging Penny out to dry. The truth is, I don't like the dress, either.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you kidding me? Now Bernadette doesn't like the dress?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (whispers) Oh, she is the worst.</p>", "6658": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Pigeon check for Sheldon. North side's all clear!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Great. Let's look at some planets!</p>", "6659": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, why'd you lug your telescope all the way over here? Leonard has one in our apartment.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, I'm gonna use Leonard's. Might as well hold my hand up like this and squint.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't know. It seemed pretty good. You know, once when the cable went out, I watched an entire episode of The Bachelor on a TV across the street.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> This one's more of a professional model.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So was the girl he picked!</p>", "6660": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> This baby's got a ten-inch diameter with f/10 ACF optics.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> And tonight Mercury is at its highest elongation.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It makes far-away things seem close, and Mercury is a planet.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know Mercury is a planet. But the-the other thing was helpful.</br></p>", "6661": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, look at that. Neil Gaiman tweeted about my store!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What did he say? Uh, \"Next time you're in Pasadena, check out The Comic Center. Great vibe, old school, the owner really knows his stuff.\" Isn't that amazing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, uh, it's no Sandman, but I guess we can't expect everything he writes to be a masterpiece.</p>", "6662": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Obviously, vibranium is the most powerful metal in comics.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What, more powerful than adamantium?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He's right. Wolverine's claws, Ultron's outer shell. Need I go on?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You don't need to, but you probably will.</p>", "6663": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What about Wonder Woman's bracelets?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Good point. Strong as a metal and fierce as a fashion choice.<br/>\nNeil Gaiman: You know, Thor's hammer's pretty powerful, and in the comics, it's made out of enchanted uru.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Uh, yeah, I think it's the enchantment that's powerful, not the uru, but, uh, thanks for playing.</p>", "6664": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can you see Mercury? Can you see it?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> One second.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, the Greek version of Mercury, Hermes, was worshipped in Athens by the carving of giant wooden phalluses.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Please, Amy, get your mind out of the ancient Athenian gutter.</p>", "6665": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Got another follower. I'm blowing up.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Great. How many does that make?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> High double digits.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The nineties?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Mid double digits.</p>", "6666": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, uh, Penny, do you want to check this out?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, sure.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> All right, just, uh, look through here, and if you want to take a picture, just push that button.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay. Oh, what is that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (gasps) Is it Mercury? I'm really jonesing for Mercury.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I think it's a little early for Mercury to be visible yet.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Playing hard to get. I like that in a planet.</p>", "6667": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> No, there's something fuzzy.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Is it your teen years?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No. Yes. Shut up.</p>", "6668": "<p><strong>Grant:</strong> So, this is really where Neil Gaiman shops?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Neil Gaiman, Nicolas Cage, Natalie Portman. The list goes on.<br/><strong>Grant:</strong> They all come here?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Unless I'm lying.</p>", "6669": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hey, guys. That tweet actually got people to come in. Isn't that great?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. I liked the way the store was before.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You mean empty and sad?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, it was perfect. Like a funeral home that sells Pokemon cards.</p>", "6670": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What am I supposed to do now if I want to hang out and read a comic book?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Go sit on the couch.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Next to a stranger? If I'm going to sit, read, and ignore a woman, it's going to be my fianc\u00e9e.</p>", "6671": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know what? Just give me a copy of Action Comics 1000, and I'll be on my way.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Sorry. All out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now you just let people come in and buy them? I didn't realize your soul was also for sale.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, it wasn't, but, uh, make me an offer.</p>", "6672": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Who is that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Who is he mad at?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Neil Gaiman.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Who's that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not us.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> [clink glasses] Great.</p>", "6673": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Look at that! I discovered a comet! Oh!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What do you mean you discovered it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I'm the one who saw it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> In my telescope that I positioned. All you did was look into it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, you both discovered it. You can put both your names on the registration form.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Actually, we can't.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Because when I filled it out, it asked for name of discoverer, and I put \"Rajesh Koothrappali\" because because that's who I am, and that's what I did.</p>", "6674": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you kidding me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, he is the one who knew it was a comet.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, he didn't. He thought it was an eyelash!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And you thought it was a fuzzy streak. I mean, do you even know what a comet is?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, the thing I saw first.</p>", "6675": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I honestly don't think that that qualifies as a discovery.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> But I took the picture.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Because I told you to! Like, if a monkey took the picture, did it discover the comet?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Excuse me?!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, he didn't mean monkey.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Get the hell out of my apartment!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And she didn't mean that. [Penny turns to Leonard] Actually, I think she did. You should go.</br></p>", "6676": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You look great.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, thanks. Would you believe this is actually a dress from before I was pregnant?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, it's not a competition, but I wore this suit to my Bar Mitzvah.</p>", "6677": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Listen to this. I-I was ringing up a customer, and I heard someone say, \"Hey, there's a line,\" and I looked, and there was.</p>", "6678": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I am really sorry. I will make it up to you. But it won't be with a Val Kilmer Batman figurine (laughing) because some sucker's buying that right now. [to the customer] (laughs) Not you. This is great.</p>", "6679": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> He says he has to work.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, it's okay. We can have date night another night.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But you got all dressed up. We were supposed to have dinner and romance.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We'll just have to divide and conquer. I'll go to dinner, and you can stay home with the Internet and have romance.</p>", "6680": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, look, I Googled it. I took the picture, so it's my discovery. (scoffs) He stole my comet.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know, but on the other hand, do you really care?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes, I care. This happens to me all the time. People take one look at me and assume I don't know what I'm talking about.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I'm sure that's not true.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm sorry. Are you saying I don't know what I'm talking about?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I'm not saying anything, ever again.</p>", "6681": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, I'm serious. The other day at work, I had this great idea, but no one was listening to me. And then five minutes later, Paul said the same thing, and they practically carried him around the room.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, well, what was it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, CPK for lunch, but that's just one example.</p>", "6682": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> [turning to the guy next to him] Hey, Howard, did you see that? (shrieks)<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm over here, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That was a close one. I almost went home with that guy.</p>", "6683": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You doing okay? Do we need to go?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I'm fine. I admit all these people did take me by surprise at first, but I've learned that I can accept change.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> S-Since when?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I managed it when Amy switched her shampoo from Prell to Prell For Oily Hair. Hmm? Although I do miss the way her head used to slide off the pillow.</p>", "6684": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can you believe it? In the past decade, I have spent thousands of dollars in that store, and this is the thanks I get.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You're right. I mean, he could at least get you a mug.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He gave me a mug. What do you think I'm drinking out of? Do you even pay attention?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Honestly, less and less.</p>", "6685": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, the comic book store is like my version of the country in Black Panther.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, I'm afraid this is gonna get really offensive to certain groups.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The nation of Wakanda was a hidden gem, and they wanted to keep it that way, because they knew if they opened it up to the world, everything that was special about it would get ruined.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you done?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (relieved sigh) Oh, okay. That both made sense and wasn't offensive.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And to make things worse, Stuart hired some woman.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> There we go.</p>", "6686": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No I'm not annoyed that she's a woman. I'm annoyed, and she's a woman.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, I get that. I'm annoyed and I'm a woman.</p>", "6687": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's just, Stuart knows my likes and dislikes. And I can count on his discretion if I pick up the occasional back issue of Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen. Which I don't.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, don't think of her as a stranger. Just think of her as a a friend you haven't berated, lectured or condescended to yet.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I hadn't thought of it that way. Thank you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You're welcome.</p>", "6688": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I'm sorry she's upset. But she didn't discover it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, come on, you know she was a part of it. Just add her name to the registration.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> But I already told everyone at work that I did it. My boss was so excited, he started calling me Captain Comet. Which is better than his last nickname for me: Dr. Doughnuts. Because one time I had two doughnuts. And two times I had three doughnuts.</p>", "6689": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I guess you're just gonna have to swallow your pride.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I, I, I can't do that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure you can, just pretend it's two or three doughnuts.</p>", "6690": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You don't understand. Leonard, I need this. My last big discovery was: if you press your upper lip hard enough, you can block a sneeze.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> I told you that.</br></p>", "6691": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> This is all my fault. I brought this upon myself. I'm a bad scientist. I'm a selfish person.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, no, don't get upset. You're not a bad person. Just let me talk to Penny. I'm-I'm sure I can make her understand.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you. You're a good friend, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm glad you think so, 'cause I may be living here soon.</p>", "6692": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just look at her over there. She just started, and she gets to put up \"Staff Picks.\" I've been coming here for ten years, I still can't put up \"Sheldon Dislikes.\"</p>", "6693": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I talked to her yesterday. She really seems to know her stuff.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Challenge accepted.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That is not what that was.</p>", "6694": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me. I was wondering if you could recommend something.<br/><strong>Denise:</strong> Oh, sure. You want to tell me what you like?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I would not.<br/><strong>Denise:</strong> All right, well, you're wearing a Green Lantern shirt, so I'm guessing you're a DC fan. Although that's from the Alan Scott era, so you're probably not super into the current run. How would you feel about an alternate history where World War I was fought with dragons and magic?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's what I wanted the theme of my tenth birthday party to be!</p>", "6695": "<p>Neil Gaiman: You know, if you're interested in alternate histories, Neil Gaiman wrote one called 1602.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, we're in the middle of something here.<br/>\nNeil Gaiman: It is pretty good, actually. He takes the Marvel superheroes and he puts them into Elizabethan England.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let me guess, everyone thinks the X-Men are witches.<br/>\nNeil Gaiman: Yeah.</p>", "6696": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Where have you been?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I went to yell at Raj.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And? Is he gonna give me back my comet?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Interesting thing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Did you cave?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe I did, or maybe I did.</p>", "6697": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> But I did realize something. I-I don't need to fight your battles. You you are a strong and independent woman. You have your own voice. And, to quote another strong woman, Katy Perry, it's time to hear you roar.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Did you just think of that on your way home?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you want from me? The song was on in the car. But it doesn't mean that it's not true.</p>", "6698": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know I don't say it enough, but you go, girl.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That was enough.</p>", "6699": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What's all this?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, we missed our date night, and Stuart's working again, so I thought we could have a date night here at home.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Aw, that's so sweet.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. So is that really what you're wearing to our date night?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, Stuart's not here and the kids are sleeping. I could wear nothing.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You might want to hold off on that, we're starting with soup.</p>", "6700": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh the funniest thing happened today. You know the, uh, receipt tape in the cash register? It ran out. I didn't even know it could do that.</p>", "6701": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> There goes date night.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Are you kidding? Stuart's here! Get your purse. We're going out.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What about the dinner you made?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Right. Hey, Stuart! That can of soup sitting by the stove, that's for you!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You made canned soup for date night?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And you wore sweatpants. Let's go.</p>", "6702": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, and it turns out Denise is also really excited for Dan Slott's run on Iron Man, because he was her favorite Spider-Man writer, too.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> How about that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh! And guess who goes to art school right here in Pasadena.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hmm. I don't know. Denise?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're a good guesser, Amy. Not as good as Denise, though. She thought I would like this comic, Arrowsmith, and she was right.</p>", "6703": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You must be Denise.<br/><strong>Denise:</strong> Oh, yeah. How can I help you?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm Amy, Sheldon's fianc\u00e9e.<br/><strong>Denise:</strong> Oh. I got to be honest, I wasn't a hundred percent sure you were real.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, I am.</p>", "6704": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> And I heard you and Sheldon had a great time today talking about comic books.<br/><strong>Denise:</strong> We did.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Great. Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna teach me how to do that.<br/><strong>Denise:</strong> Do what?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Pretend to like comic books.<br/><strong>Denise:</strong> Oh, no, I actually like comic books.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> All right, let's not get hung up on semantics. It's late, we got a lot of work to do.</p>", "6705": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong>  I'm sorry.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> I haven't even said anything yet.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I know, but I heard your footsteps coming up the stairs, and they sounded angry.</br></p>", "6706": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I was being I was being a jerk. We did this together, and I hogged all of the credit. And after you've been such a good friend to me over the years. Like, I wouldn't even be able to talk to women if it wasn't for you, so so I'm I'm gonna make sure that your name is on the comet.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Even if it's professionally embarrassing. You know, or maybe put me on thin ice at work. I may lose my funding. I still, uh still want to make this right.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Good. Bye.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That worked way better with Leonard.</p>", "6707": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why are you reading a comic book?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Denise recommended it to me. It's the Rebirth Omnibus. She thought it would be a good entry point for me into the DC Universe, and I have to say I really do like-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, Amy, Amy, I've talked a lot about comic books lately, can we talk about something else?</p>", "6708": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who are all these people? What, is this a flash mob?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Are they dancing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know what today's dancing looks like.</p>", "6709": "<p><strong>Howard: </strong> Why are you being such a baby about the crowds? You go to Comic-Con.<br/><strong>Sheldon: </strong> You-- I'm sorry. You're comparing this place to Comic-Con? Well, can I go to the bathroom here next to a Wookiee who got his zipper stuck in his fur?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wow, we go to Comic-Con for different reasons.</p>", "6710": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're wise, and you smell like books. You really are the whole package.</p>", "6711": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> You guys want to see a real star, look over here.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I just got retweeted by Patton Oswalt's brother.</p>", "6712": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mailman's here!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aw, remember when he used to get that excited to see us?</p>", "6713": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What is so exciting?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's a letter from Dr. Wolcott. We've been corresponding about my string theory research.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait. Robert Wolcott? Like Wolcott's Theorem Wolcott?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The very same.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Didn't he go crazy and cut off all contact with people?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, he was driven mad by a friend who kept wanting to talk about the Hulk's car insurance!</p>", "6714": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Leonard, you are not letting Sheldon go alone this weekend.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am a grown man. I don't need somebody to chaperone me. I just need him to drop me off, pick me up, and pack me a sack lunch.</p>", "6715": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Amy can't take him, it's her bachelorette party this weekend.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes, it is, because (excitedly) I'm getting married!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you gonna be doing that all weekend?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes. Do you know why?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (excitedly) Because you're getting married!</p>", "6716": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Leonard, you cannot drop him off. You have to stay with him and keep him safe.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howard, you have to go and keep Leonard safe.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Fine. I get it, and you want me to go and keep Howard safe.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Actually, I-<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Uh, just say yes, or he's gonna want to come to the bachelorette party.</p>", "6717": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I wish I could say none of that is gonna happen, but Penny is planning it, and she is the reason I own those underwear with writing across the butt.</p>", "6718": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, just be careful, and use protection.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What do you think is gonna happen?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know. But it's going to be sunny, and you burn easily.</p>", "6719": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> When I said you should make a playlist for the road trip, I meant music.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is better than music, this is a lecture on nonlinear time.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sounds like it's just on regular time.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, but I put it on shuffle.</p>", "6720": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, now, I promised Sheldon things weren't gonna get too crazy tonight. Should I be worried?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, just about who you're marrying.</br></p>", "6721": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> My bachelorette party's a quilting bee! (forced chuckle)<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Isn't it perfect?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, instead of oiled-up strippers and sex toys, we thought: what does Amy like?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (unenthusiastically) Amy likes the quilting bee.</p>", "6722": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, this place is creepy.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, did you see his vegetable garden? Heirloom tomatoes in April. Creepy.</p>", "6723": "<p><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> Dr. Cooper. Uh, who are these people?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, these are my friends. I wrote about them in my letter.<br/><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> Oh, letter? I didn't get a letter.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that's because I just sent it this morning, you know? So score one for linear time.</p>", "6724": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, um, no offense, Dr. Wolcott, but I'm not sure this makes any sense.<br/><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> That's because I've written it all backwards.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wow. That's \"wow\" backwards.</p>", "6725": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm. I still don't get it.<br/><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> Well, plus the numbers are letters and the letters are numbers.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. I love him!</p>", "6726": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So you thought that I would like quilting?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, don't you?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Of course I like quilting! It's the slowest way to make a blanket! But this is my bachelorette party! It's supposed to be fun and wild and full of bad decisions.</p>", "6727": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Come on, let's go somewhere we can do body shots off shirtless bartenders.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't know. That might be too much.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, you know what, why don't we stay home, have a little wine?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What are you not getting about this?!</p>", "6728": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You understanding any of this?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I haven't understood anything since poop tomato.</p>", "6729": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon's right. This guy, this guy's brilliant.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, I mean, he's a little kooky, but a mind that can reconceptualize time probably has a reason for keeping a jar of toenail clippings that we just don't understand.</p>", "6730": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> [To the hot bartender] Do you do body shots?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, she said she didn't want one.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Mind your business.</p>", "6731": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Amy? Amy? Should we get her home?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why? She's sound asleep, and we have sliders coming.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> One more round!</p>", "6732": "<p><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> Hey, where are my manners? You fellas must be hungry. Do you like rabbit?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sounds good.<br/><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> Okay, but can you tell the difference between rabbit and squirrel?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong>  Don't think so.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Probably not.<br/><strong>Doctor Wolcott:</strong> Great! We're having rabbit. Be right back!</p>", "6733": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It is amazing how much he's accomplished by isolating himself from the distractions of day-to-day life.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, please don't tell me you want to live like this.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> See, that's the strange thing. I don't. What is wrong with me? Why don't I want this? Look at how cool it all is.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong>  Nothing is wrong with you. You have friends, you have a fiancee, you have a full life.</p>", "6734": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, you didn't pass out before you did all kinds of fun stuff.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What did I do?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What did you do? What'd she do?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Um well, you don't remember Riverdancing on top of the bar?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I did that?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong>  Yeah, you did!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mm-hmm.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> But I don't know how to Riverdance.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Didn't stop you from teaching all those shirtless firemen.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I saw shirtless firemen?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Saw, smelled, slid down like a pole.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Did I flash anybody?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How about everybody?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I can't believe it. I'm so embarrassed. You didn't take any pictures, did you?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong>  Oh, no, we would never do that to you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, but if there were pictures, they would be crazy.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You guys are good friends.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mmm.</p>", "6735": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How was your bachelorette party?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I was in a bar, and I saw some shirtless men. They were firemen, and they fought over me. But Penny and Bernadette got me out of there before the victor got my spoils.</br></p>", "6736": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What's the matter? You look glum.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, would you still love me if I wasn't who you thought I was? What are you talking about? Well, what if it turns out I'm not the single-minded, science-obsessed recluse who puts his work above everything and everybody else that you fell in love with?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What if I'm not the straightlaced, buttoned-up, quilting queen you thought I was? What if I'm a Riverdancing wild woman?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'd still love you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'd still love you, too.</p>", "6737": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> If Bruce Banner's driving a rental car and turns into the Hulk, do you think he's covered, or does he need to add the Hulk as an additional driver?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You really need a girlfriend.</p>", "6738": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong>  It's not your fault. I mean, what man wouldn't be seduced by the power to decide how late the laundry room stays open?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, you're the reason I had to come back and get my jeans the next morning?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't believe you expect me to give that up.</p>", "6739": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Can't believe you got her number.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I know, right? How amazing would it be if this worked out and the story of how I met my wife started with you and me in the hot tub together.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, do us both a favor and start the story later.</p>", "6740": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You're like Grey's Anatomy for robots. Also, why isn't that a show?</p>", "6741": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Aren't you worried there's some kid out there missing his drone?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, please. This is not a children's toy. This thing's got an HD camera on it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Aren't you worried that there's some rich peeping tom out there missing his drone?</p>", "6742": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey. What you got there?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I grabbed a sandwich at the food truck out front.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, n-now, hold on. Tonight is Friday, and I believe you know what that means.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That my fun, young life took a drastic turn somewhere?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But yeah.</p>", "6743": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, that means it's Chinese food night.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, and you have Chinese food. So eat it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I can smell your pastrami.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And we can all hear your complaining, so no one's happy.</p>", "6744": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What is happening? Everybody's supposed to be eating Chinese food.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, actually, I believe the Chinese may have invented the sandwich. Their dish \"rou jia mo\u00e2\" literally means \"meat between bread.\" So, it looks like all of us, including Penny, are eating Chinese food.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Except for you, Sheldon. You're eating crow.</p>", "6745": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> And I think you're forgetting that there are written documents of meat between bread being eaten in China during the Tang dynasty.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong>  (to Howard) You know what, I'll go with you. And then maybe we just go home.</p>", "6746": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm. Well, maybe the Chinese did invent the sandwich. I guess you were right.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Too bad no one's around to hear it.</p>", "6747": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, there's something you like, but it's also driving you crazy. Been there, doing it now.</p>", "6748": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, why don't I just go down to the food truck and ask them to move?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why are you taking cash?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No reason.</p>", "6749": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, Howard, look. What's that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Huh. Looks like someone's drone.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, no. Do you think it was spying on us in the hot tub? 'Cause I'm only 40% of the way to my beach bod.</p>", "6750": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What is going on here?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're the tenants association?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (laughs) You should see the look on your face. You might want to tell your wife that there's no \"Y\" in \"pastrami\".</br></p>", "6751": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Do you know he is the entire tenants association?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, but I'm not surprised. He's also the pope of a planet he invented in hyperspace.</p>", "6752": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, if you can vote yourself in, then we can vote you out.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. Make a motion at the next meeting.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> When is that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's the first Saturday of every month. Unless there's an emergency meeting.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Then we call an emergency meeting.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You really don't have to. This is the first Saturday of the month.</p>", "6753": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ah, I should've taken that gavel and shoved it right down his throat.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ugh. I would've gone the other way, but it would've gotten to his throat.</p>", "6754": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So you just let him get away with anything?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, not anything. But honestly, pastrami sandwich is not the hill I want to die on.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's not about the sandwich. It's about the principle.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, principle. And a little bit sandwich.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah.</p>", "6755": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I hope there's nothing disturbing on there.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Like you two in a hot tub?</p>", "6756": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, that's plenty to go on. We can't give up. We got to find her.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You just want to find her 'cause she's cute.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Not just because she's cute. She also owns a pretty expensive drone, which means she has money and doesn't mind wasting it. And I I like that in a woman.</p>", "6757": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Do you see anything that could help us locate her?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hmm, let me have a look.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She's got eagle eyes, always spotting continuity errors in movies. (chuckles) It's not annoying at all.</p>", "6758": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Do you know who she is?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, sure, yeah. That's Cynthia.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wha s-so, she's a customer?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Yeah, yeah, but I-I haven't seen her in a while. And before you say anything, there is a lot of reasons women stop coming here. It's not just me.</p>", "6759": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> A little tip. Uh, stick with the smiles you know.</p>", "6760": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I have an advanced degree in the study of the human brain, so if my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 is a raving lunatic, it's kind of a ding on my reputation.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If leaders just stepped aside every time they didn't have the consent of the governed, what would we have?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Democracy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not on my watch.</p>", "6761": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I believe they do text him. The-the Bat-Signal is linked to his phone via Bluetooth.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Has that been in the comics?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, it's just what I believe.</p>", "6762": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> When's he coming?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, he gets in on Sunday, and Monday morning, I'm gonna give him a tour of the labs and offices.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. He gets in on Sunday, April first? (chuckles) Nice try, Penny.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What're you talking about?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> April Fools' Day. This is another one of your classic pranks you try to pull on me every year.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Literally never pulled a prank on you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, really? What about last year, when you sent me that e-mail with the photo attached, but you didn't attach a photo.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That was a mistake.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Messing with me? Yes, it was. And this year, I am not falling for it.</p>", "6763": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I'm-I'm just saying, what are you gonna do when he wants to talk about high-level language interpreters for microcomputers?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What are high-level language interpreters for microcomputers? A way of programming computers using words and commands instead of binary code.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. That's actually kind of interesting. Tell me more.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, well-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That, I'll do that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I didn't even see it coming.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You never do.</p>", "6764": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Bye, my babies, I love you.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> (high-pitched) We love you, too, Mommy.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, don't do that.</p>", "6765": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Where you off to?<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> El parque.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> El parque?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'm learning Spanish so I can talk to the other nannies.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> How's that going?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Bueno.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Good?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh. No bueno.</br></p>", "6766": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Can I get you anything? Juice box? 'nanas?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong>  'nanas?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sorry. Mom brain. I think I've forgot how to talk to grown-ups. I meant Ba-nanas.</p>", "6767": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, what are we watching?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Bob the Builder. I'll catch you up. That one's Bob. He's a builder.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Isn't this a kids show?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's what we watch in this house. Bob the Builder, Dinosaur Train, and Peppa Pig, which is both funny and meaningful.</p>", "6768": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You want to take a break and maybe get something to eat?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why does it not feel like we're going?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hang on, I-I just want to see if Bob can fix it. (chuckles) Yes, he can!</p>", "6769": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I folded your laundry for you. You're welcome.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, that's not mine.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're saying that these aren't yours?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So you're saying that I'm touching a stranger's underpants?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And just like that, it's the worst day of my life.</p>", "6770": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I just need you to tell me the truth. This is driving me crazy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, he is really coming.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is he?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> He is.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, now I don't know what to believe!</p>", "6771": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Thanks for getting me out of the house. I feel like my brain is turning to mush.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Happy to help.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Did I show you the video of the kids sitting?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes, you texted it to me at 3:00 a.m. Thought someone was either in jail or dead.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm sorry.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, no, i-it gave me something to watch while I tried to go back to sleep.</p>", "6772": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You know what? I don't want to be one of those moms who can only talk about her kids.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, well, I'm reading a pretty good book. It's the untold story of female artists during the Renaissance.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, I'm in the middle of a book, too. It's three pages long and floats in the bath.</p>", "6773": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> All right, we can talk about something else.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It also quacks when you squeeze it. You should've seen Michael laugh. I think I have a video.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Or maybe we can't.</p>", "6774": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I totally just saw what hotel he's staying at.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What are we waiting here for?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> For Penny to walk down the stairs, get in her car, and drive away.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Right, smart. ... Is that long enough?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She's pretty quick, let's go.</p>", "6775": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Guys, guys, that's him. Be cool.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Cooler.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</p>", "6776": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> God. What's happening? I'm a smart, educated, successful...<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> \"Woman\"?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I was gonna get it.</p>", "6777": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Don't be so hard on yourself. Pregnancy and childbirth actually cause physical changes to the structure of your brain.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I liked the old structure of my brain. But then, I liked a lot of my old structures.</p>", "6778": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong>  Oh. Hi, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Didn't you hear me yell \"hold the door\"?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I did. But you know what they say, \"hold the door, get robbed some more.\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No one says that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Well, they should, because it's true, and it rhymes.</p>", "6779": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not an April Fools' joke, Sheldon. I actually went to a hotel and met him.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Right, right. Okay, so, uh, \"Bill Gates\" was at the \"hotel\" that you \"went to.\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why is \"went to\" in quotes?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. So \"Bill Gates\" was at the \"hotel\" that you went to.</p>", "6780": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's you and Bill Gates.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> It is.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Were you crying?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.</br></p>", "6781": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, it wasn't a joke, and I actually could've met him?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, he's probably still there.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (gasps) What hotel?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The La Quinta Inn in Thousand Oaks, under the name Hernandez.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you, thank you so much!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> April fools.</p>", "6782": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, as it turns out, there is a little reception for Mr. Gates tomorrow night. I asked if I could bring you, and they said yes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, you get to meet Bill Gates again.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait, what do you mean \"again\"?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> 'Cause you met him that one time with your mom.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes. And then again tomorrow, for a total of two, and only two times.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. I wonder if he'll remember you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, I wonder that, too.</p>", "6783": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> The sun is losing about six times ten to the 12th grams per second, so the fraction of the mass it loses every year is about ten to the negative 13th. But don't worry. It'll be millions of years before we all freeze to death. Sweet dreams.</p>", "6784": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Evolution gave me this mom brain to focus on the baby, but I figure I can hack it to learn all kinds of new things.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, that's great.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah. There was a problem, and I fixed it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Like Bob the Builder in that giraffe cage.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Spoiler alert. I didn't see that one yet.</p>", "6785": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So that's fun. You get to meet Bill Gates again.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not fun, I'm screwed.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's fun for us.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe he won't remember you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I snotted on his tie.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, you did, like, a lot.</p>", "6786": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, Leonard. Thought I'd find you here. You snake.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What's going on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He sent me all the way to Thousand Oaks to meet Bill Gates when he knew full well he wasn't staying there.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wha-- Leonard, that's terrible.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, why would you do that? You know he's staying at the DoubleTree in Long Beach.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aha! Wait. How do I know you're not tricking me?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We probably are.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong>  But what if we're not?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You think you're so smart. You think I'm going to fall for it again, don't you? Well, I won't.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where you going?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Shut up.</p>", "6787": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I mean, really, the bigger danger isn't the loss of mass. Instead, it will run out of hydrogen to use for nuclear fuel, swell up into a red giant, and fry the Earth.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So you don't want to split a salad?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, thank you. But speaking of splitting things, did you hear about the light-splitting greenhouse film that could improve photosynthetic efficiency?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Just a little something I read while nursing a human being that I made.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm just gonna get the chicken.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Ah. N-E-K-C-I-H-C: chicken backwards. Boom, mom brain.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And a whole bottle of wine.</p>", "6788": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> How are you ladies doing? Raise your hands if you're bueno. Me llamo Stuart Bloom.</p>", "6789": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Why is your screen name \"JohnWilliams\"?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, because I always score.</p>", "6790": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Evolution gave me this mom brain to focus on the baby, but I figure I can hack it to learn all kinds of new things.</p>", "6791": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Amy made me realize that new mothers are cognitively primed to take in new information, and I've been wasting it making up songs about our babies' toes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> To be fair, I cowrote \"Pinky Toe, Pinky Toe.\"</p>", "6792": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I said some pretty unprofessional things about his work. I may have even used the \"S\" word.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Subpar?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not proud of it, Amy, but I have a temper.</p>", "6793": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, fun fact, did you know baby boys can pee straight up?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Grown-up boys, too.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why would we high-five that?</p>", "6794": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Good news, we have save the date cards.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Huh, didn't go with my calligrapher. Interesting.</p>", "6795": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I suppose we can give it a look, and if it doesn't work out, I hear that there is a nearby Chinese restaurant that Einstein used to frequent.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Or, we pick a place we like, and don't worry about Einstein.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Boy, reality TV is right; brides are crazy.</br></p>", "6796": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, how has it been, being home with two kids?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, tiring, but super rewarding.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, like Pilates, yeah, got it.</p>", "6797": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Here's my dilemma, I kind of want to stay home. But Bernadette is a way better parent than I am.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wait, does Bernadette want to stay home?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. She's really invested in her career, and she's doing great. I think it should be me.</p>", "6798": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Wow, I admire you, Howard. It would be hard for me to buck traditional gender roles like that.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Didn't you see Taylor Swift twice this month?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, because she's hot, not because she sings my truth.</p>", "6799": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, it seems kind of perfect, and it's close enough to your office, so you can use the bathroom you like.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mm. I put a sticker over the auto-flush, so it doesn't startle me.</p>", "6800": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I mean, Leonard and Penny are right there.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But he told me he checked on our membership just last week, and we were still 400th in line.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm sure there's an innocent explanation that won't ruin my day at all.</p>", "6801": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How did you get in here?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What do you mean? Leonard's a member.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You told me it was incredibly exclusive.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Y-Yeah, look, about that, I lied.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, wait, you told me it was exclusive, too.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mm-hmm. I avoided him and impressed you, all with the same lie.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Damn, Hofstadter, didn't think you had it in you.</p>", "6802": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Uh, I was thinking maybe one of us should stay home full-time, with the kids.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh great, so I have to give up my job and everything I've worked for?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Actually, I was thinking I should stay home.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, so I have to abandon my children and go back to work, while you get to stay home and bond with them?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You just said you didn't want to.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, I don't want to have to, but if I want to, I should get to.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Do you want to?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Maybe I do.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What if I also want to?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, I don't know, we can't both stay home.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't you think you should go back to work, because you make more money?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Don't you think you should make more money?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I think it's pretty sexist of you to say a dad can't stay home with his children.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You know what else is sexist, the phrase \"suck it\", yet here we are.</p>", "6803": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't believe Leonard lied to me. What are we gonna find out next, that he's not really lactose intolerant, hmm? He's just friends with an invisible trumpet player?</p>", "6804": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So do we agree? Do we want to get married there?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know. I mean, Einstein was a member. I like that. You know? But Leonard's a member, and that really steams my clams.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, I love it when you're folksy. I'm just gonna call.</p>", "6805": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Morning.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, where you been?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, nowhere special. Just the park, the farmer's market, then we hopped on the Gold Line to Chinatown because it's important for the kids to experience other cultures. What have you been doing?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's 8:00 a.m. Sleeping.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. So are the kids. I guess they take after you.</p>", "6806": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're just trying to prove that you'd do a better job than me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're pretty sharp having just woken up.</p>", "6807": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howard, we both know you can't keep up this pace. By this afternoon you're gonna be passed out on the couch and I'm gonna have three exhausted babies to deal with.</p>", "6808": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, in fact, why don't you take the day off?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Mm, fine. Maybe I'll have lunch with Penny.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Take your time. Get a massage. You deserve it after all the sleep you've been getting.</p>", "6809": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, so if you could just please leave before I get angry and say something I will regret about your face, your height, your personal hygiene or the fact that your science, while serviceable, lacks panache.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's actually one of the nicest things you've ever said about my work.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And now I regret it. Good-bye.</p>", "6810": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, I just wanted to stop in and see my office before we went to lunch.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Just a few more weeks, you'll be back full-time, huh?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh-oh. That wasn't a happy \"yeah.\" That was a \"Hey, Leonard, do you want to go to the gym?\" yeah.</br></p>", "6811": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Gerald, what's going on? Hope you're not screwing up my research. You calling from a bike ride? 'Cause you're backpedaling hard.</p>", "6812": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Bernadette's gonna be home soon. We got to divide and conquer. I'll make dinner. You watch the kids.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, kids are asleep.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Great, then you make dinner.</p>", "6813": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait, what? I scrubbed sludge for you. I may be slightly radioactive.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, you're exaggerating. Don't let him touch the silverware.</p>", "6814": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why is Raj asleep on our couch?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. I needed some help so he came by, played with the kids, read them some stories, put them down for their nap and made dinner.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What'd you do?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Ate dinner.</p>", "6815": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, I love the kids, but I also love my job. And sleep.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I know. I took a two-hour nap on the couch in my office.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I took a three-hour nap on the floor in the living room.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How do you feel now?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Honestly? Still tired.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Me, too.</p>", "6816": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Everyone's asleep. You want to head upstairs and (giggles) you know.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Let's just do it right here.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, oh, I like the way you think. [They move a plate away, and both put their heads down to sleep]</p>", "6817": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm making the situation better with humor.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Are you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Would you rather me make it better with magic?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Go back to sleep.</p>", "6818": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, any day now.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, I don't know. We went to the doctor this morning, and she said it could still be another week or two.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How's Bernadette holding up?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's pretty rough. She's having a hard time.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why are you smiling? I had sex twice last night.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's not fair! She's on bed rest. She can't run away.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It was her idea. She read that it can start labor.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hmm. Is that true?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, I would have Googled it, but I was busy taking my pants off.</p>", "6819": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, I was just talking about you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, should I ask?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You should not.</p>", "6820": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm trying to get our grant proposal together. Any chance you've finished up those mechanical drawings?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, sorry. I was gonna do it last night, but I got kind of busy.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, you did.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What are they talking about?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll give you a hint. It's something that we have done four times.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Watched La La Land?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What? No. No. I've not watched La La Land four times. If you find the soundtrack on my phone, that's just 'cause our iTunes accounts are linked.</p>", "6821": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, when my yoga instructor was pregnant, she told me there are tons of poses that put her right into labor.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'll try, but I feel like bendy poses are what got me into this mess.</p>", "6822": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm telling you, there's an acupressure point right above your ankle that can induce contractions.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> All right, but just a warning. My feet are a little swollen.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, please, Bernadette. I'm sure this ... okay.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Nothing. Your ankles look fine, and not at all like I just popped open a can of crescent rolls.</p>", "6823": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> My mother believes that if you're not prepared mentally, it can delay your body from going into labor.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So what are you trying to say? It's my fault?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (sighs) Raj is crazy. Your ankles aren't that gross.</p>", "6824": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. I am here to sit with you and keep you company.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, that's nice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, by playing the most complicated board game ever invented: Campaign for North Africa. I bought it off eBay. It smells a little like chili, but all the pieces are there.</p>", "6825": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Are there any engineers on the grant committee?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't know. Why?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I didn't have time to figure out the three-input hydraulic manifold, so this diagram is really just a flux capacitor from Back to the Future.</br></p>", "6826": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong>  Hey, I just wish I could be there when you present it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's okay. It's more important that you spend time with Michael.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Who's Michael?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Uh, your son?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, it's not. My son doesn't have a name yet.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (long silence) Okay, well, then, Bernadette's son.</p>", "6827": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You wish. You are hundreds of hours away from the middle.</p>", "6828": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So you're just gonna name him Michael? Were you even gonna tell me?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I told you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> When?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, right. That was Amy.</p>", "6829": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What are you guys doing here?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon texted and said Bernadette wanted us all to come over.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The game's best with five to ten players.</p>", "6830": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, Bernadette, it's your turn. Penny's air force is strafing your supply line in Tobruk.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We're kind of busy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, but you're being pretty rude. Everyone did come over to play this game with you.</p>", "6831": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Bernadette, it's your turn.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What about Greg?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, I'll just roll for you. Ooh! That is a good one! Your troops' morale rating is pretty high.<br/>\nNow, Leonard, as the defender, we need to subtract your morale rating from Bernadette's to get a final adjusted morale rating for the assault. And I will just check the assault differential column. Ooh! Who said war was hell? Yeah, that's a rhetorical question. Sherman said it.</p>", "6832": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, we're talking about something important here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (sighs) Fine. If you pick a baby name, can we get back to playing?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, here we go. Ranatanata.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You can't name him Ranatanata.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, right, it's a boy. That'd be ridiculous. (gasps) What about Ozymandias?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you making these up or having a stroke?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ozymandias is from a poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley. Oh, oh! Bysshe Wolowitz. Solved. Back to the game. Heyo! Sandstorm!</p>", "6833": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Guys. Guys, wake up. Terrible news.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, my God. What, what, what? Is it the baby?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. No, no, we miscalculated our unassigned armor class units. We need to start over.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no, no, no, not from the beginning. Just from when the tanks started moving.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (sighs) That was five hours ago.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mm, no. No, that was two hours ago. It only feels like five.</p>", "6834": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, it can take some time for pigment to form. You're still not out of the woods.</p>", "6835": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, what'd you name him?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Neil Michael. Neil for Armstrong, Gaiman, and Diamond. Michael because Bernie had to get six stitches.</p>", "6836": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm not gonna fight her. That kid's head was the size of a cantaloupe.</p>", "6837": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So you're not going to do something just because you think it might upset me?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, it's tricky, because answering that question honestly is one of the things I tend not to do because it upsets you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that's very upsetting.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Like I said.</p>", "6838": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What other things don't you do because of me?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Remember last week when we went to that dueling piano bar I was so excited about?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, now you're getting it.</p>", "6839": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Look, at least if you watch it, maybe you can find more specific things to criticize.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that is a good point. Criticisms are more hurtful when they're specific.</p>", "6840": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> [on TV] Hey, everybody. I'm Professor Proton. Welcome to the show. Today I will be teaching you how to make a real hovercraft using common household items.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Darn it, I do like objects that hover.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> [on TV] All you will need is a CD, a bottle cap, a balloon, and some super glue.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no! I have all those things!</br></p>", "6841": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, how's the book coming along?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, good. I just wrote the part where the hero, hotshot physicist Logan Dean, arrives at CERN.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, is he based on you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, kind of. But he can eat dairy products without having to leave the room.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, that's smart, because CERN is in Switzerland and there's a lot of cheese there.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hmm. Uh, believe me, that is a plot point later.</p>", "6842": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh. Oh! I just thought of the murder weapon!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Swiss army knife?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (laughs) No. [after Penny leaves] That's way better.</p>", "6843": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look, it works! We did it!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> See, there was a reason to keep that TurboTax CD.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah. A CD-ROM? More like \"CD-vroom.\"</p>", "6844": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you feel bad you told Wil Wheaton that you'd be his enemy if he did this show?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. I feel bad I'm engaged to somebody that would point that out.</p>", "6845": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> [on TV] Oh, I wonder who that could be.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just when I thought this couldn't get any better, Wil has introduced suspense into the show.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> [on TV] Hey, it's real NASA astronaut, Howard Wolowitz!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (loudly) What?!</p>", "6846": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How could Wil ask Howard to be on his show and not me?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, he is an astronaut. And he didn't start an online petition to get Wil fired.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But why wouldn't Howard tell me?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, because he probably worried that you'd be a big baby about it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All those answers make a lot of sense. Thank you, Amy. That helps.</p>", "6847": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard, I want you to know that I forgive you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'll take it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's he forgiving you for?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't care. Clean slate. Happy Yom Kippur to me.</p>", "6848": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know that you were on Wil's show, and I know why you didn't tell me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Do you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because you were afraid that I would be difficult and annoying about it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (chuckles) I hope your book has a twist as surprising as that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It doesn't.</p>", "6849": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> But this is good so far, really good.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah. I have no idea who the killer is.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, great. Me, neither.</p>", "6850": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> I want to have more female scientists represented on the show, and I thought maybe Amy might be interested?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Or wouldn't it be nice to have us both on, to show that even female scientists can land a man?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I said sorry.</p>", "6851": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I can't wait to see who the killer is. Is it that Ilsa girl? She seems pretty mean.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But adorably mean, like a baby lion?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, regular mean, like a regular lion.</p>", "6852": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> It's pretty obvious;  blonde, mean, glasses.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It doesn't say \"glasses.\"<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, really?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But it will, because Ilsa does. And you know who else wears them? Bernadette. And-and that's her, cause it's, it's totally, it's totally her.</p>", "6853": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Speaking of which, he came by yesterday to show me his book.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, and-and what did you think?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I liked it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? The Ilsa character didn't bother you?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, he was exaggerating. You're not really like that.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I know I'm not like that. The character was based on you.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't know what to tell you. When I brought it up with Leonard, he said it was you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, when I brought it up, he got all squirrelly and left the room. Son of a bitch.</p>", "6854": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I know I'm Ilsa.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wha-? That is crazy. You-you two are totally different.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> How?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, you- She- Her name's Ilsa.</p>", "6855": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you sure that's the move you want to make?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Absolutely.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay. Checkmate.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I did not see that coming. That's well played, Amy.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What's going on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You beat me, and I am responding with humility and admiration. What does it look like?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You let me win so you could show me how emotionally mature you are, didn't you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I couldn't wait for you to actually beat me; that would take forever.</br></p>", "6856": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Got to go.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I think you mean \"have to\"- [Leonard closes his laptop]</p>", "6857": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Space is the mirror of the soul. Are we looking beyond, or are we looking within?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm looking at my shoes. This is making me a little motion sick.</p>", "6858": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> When we gaze out at the immensities of space, we understand them because there are immensities within us as well. I'm Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and thank you for taking a walk with me ... through the stars.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That pause gets longer every show.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I believe ... you're right.</p>", "6859": "<p><strong>Nell:</strong> Hey. Can I get a picture with you?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Absolutely. And if you post it on social media, I suggest the hashtag \"Koothra-poet.\"</p>", "6860": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, the campus isn't safe at night. There's raccoons and undergrads just walking around like they own the place.</p>", "6861": "<p><strong>Nell:</strong> Thank you. The show was great.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I can't take all the credit. I have pretty good co-stars ... the stars.</p>", "6862": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, you know, my secret to making great omelets is that I beat the egg whites separately. Speaking of which, how long have you been separated? Speaking of which, how long have you been separated?<br/>\nNell: About two weeks.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That is not a lot of weeks. In fact, that's the bare minimum to get to the plural \"weeks\".</p>", "6863": "<p><strong>Nell:</strong> Do you say that to everyone?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Only to beautiful women. And okay women.<br/><strong>Nell:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, just to clarify: you're the first kind.</p>", "6864": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sorry, I just, I had to get out of there.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What did he do now?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Nothing. He's being a dream. Don't give me that look. That's how Penny looked at me. I'm not crazy.</p>", "6865": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Thanks for coming. What did you handsome gentlemen think of the show?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, you can turn it off now.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's sweet of you to say, but I don't think I can.</p>", "6866": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Penny and I have the same \"You're crazy\" look? That's kind of sweet.</p>", "6867": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, since we're sharing pictures, I have one to contribute.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Please don't let it be you and your dog in the bathtub.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's not. But don't swipe.</p>", "6868": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know how to deal with Sheldon being Sheldon, but Sheldon being a-a rational, thoughtful person? I'm clueless. It's like when my mom called last year to sing happy birthday and I-I just threw up.</p>", "6869": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What are we looking at here?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, that's me and a beautiful woman and my watch showing the time as 2:30 in the morning.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So, state's \"Exhibit A\"?</p>", "6870": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I met her at the planetarium a few days ago, and she invited me out for a drink.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, good for you. H-Hey, w-what's the Hindi word for \"dog\"?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Kutta.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You kutta.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Bho.n, bho.n. (chuckles) That's Hindi for woof-woof.</br></p>", "6871": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I also have a pretty cute picture to share.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What is that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> An equation. Isn't it perfect? Sometimes I just stare at it, and I think \"I can't believe that came out of me.\"</p>", "6872": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, I also have a date tonight. But don't worry, it's not another woman. It's string theory.<br/>\nBho.n, bho.n.</p>", "6873": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> See, I'm trying this new technique where I imagine how I would feel in someone else's position.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Y-You mean empathy?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I thought I came up with it.</p>", "6874": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, taking another picture with my baby. Look how big he got!</p>", "6875": "<p><strong>Nell:</strong> Morning.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Good morning.<br/><strong>Nell:</strong> Aw, you didn't have to cook me breakfast. Well, I wasn't sure how I did last night, and I wanted to finish strong.<br/><strong>Nell:</strong> You don't need to worry. Last night was great.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ah, well, you say that now, but wait until you taste this.<br/><strong>Nell:</strong> Oh, my God, this is amazing.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Which is why I keep an omelet pan in the trunk of my car.</p>", "6876": "<p><strong>Nell:</strong> My husband never cooked for me.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, uh, y-you were married.<br/><strong>Nell:</strong> Yeah. Well, technically, I guess I still am.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Is that \"technically,\" like, the paperwork hasn't gone through, or \"technically,\" like, he's in the closet watching us right now?</p>", "6877": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, do you mind me asking what he does for a living?<br/><strong>Nell:</strong> He's a firefighter.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh. Interesting. A potentially jealous man who's handy with an ax. It's-it's okay, though. He's almost had two weeks to cool down.</p>", "6878": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, the next drug is Romatrol.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I know this one. We're actually pushing it really hard. It treats mild dermatitis.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, correct. And who can it be prescribed to?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Adults and children who have absolutely, for sure, stopped growing.</p>", "6879": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> And what are the side effects?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, shoot, shoot.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mm, remember the mnemonic.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ah. GRAVY, yes. G-R-A-V-Y. Okay, gastric distress, redness, anal leakage, vasculitis and yellow eyes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, uh, so close. It's actually yellow discharge.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, right. That's why we went with \"gravy.\"</p>", "6880": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> He knows he doesn't live here anymore, right?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe he's experiencing memory loss because he took...<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Flaxitrite!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah.</p>", "6881": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, Sheldon, what are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I was just checking in on my old room to see what you've done with it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I could use a place to work in the evenings, and-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, it's just that there's not a lot of space in our apartment-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, and I feel like Amy's been having-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And since you're not-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (Sheldon starts to speak) No.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That is our room now, and we're gonna turn it into a gym.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you really expect me to believe that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.</p>", "6882": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So I guess what's bugging me is that they only broke up 13 days ago, and now I'm dating her. So, am I, like, the good guy in my movie, or the bad guy in their movie?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Pretty sure you're the weird friend in our movie.</p>", "6883": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I like her, okay? I just, I-I don't know how I feel about being the third wheel in a relationship.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Says the guy in my bed with my wife.</p>", "6884": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Guys, I mean, he's around, okay? He's apparently not happy about the breakup, and based on the sweatpants he left at her place, he's, like, a medium to large man.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe those are his \"after the holiday\" pants, like you have.</p>", "6885": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I mean, do you think it's too soon for her to be dating? If you and Bernadette broke up, like, how long would you wait?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, well, I don't even want to think-<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Eight days.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Two days to cry. Six days to hit the gym.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> First of all, you already look amazing.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Aw, that's sweet.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm gonna give him an extra day of crying.</br></p>", "6886": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> (on the phone) The answer is still no. You can say we wouldn't know you're here, but we'd know. Because you'd be here! (groans)<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So, who was that?</p>", "6887": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't believe you hung up on me!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What the hell? What are you doing here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am proving you wrong. I've been working back there for hours. You had no idea.</p>", "6888": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, look, you have an office at work. Why don't you go there?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't go to the office every time I have a brilliant thought. I'd basically be living there.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sounds good, do that.</p>", "6889": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I need somewhere to work in the evenings. You have a space you aren't using. Just take a look at my proposal.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (groans) What is this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A rental agreement. I will only use the room for work. I won't sleep here, I won't eat your food, I won't even use your bathroom.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So you can just walk in any time of the day or night?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, he does that now. At least this way we'll get paid.</p>", "6890": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I am Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and thank you for taking a walk with me ... ... through the stars.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I-I think that one was too long.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, you're right. I totally felt it.</p>", "6891": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Can I help you?<br/><strong>Oliver:</strong> Which one of you is Rajesh Koothrappali?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really? You're not sure which one of us is Rajesh Koothrappali?<br/><strong>Oliver:</strong> I am. I was just trying not to be racist.</p>", "6892": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It's gonna be okay.<br/><strong>Oliver:</strong> How is it gonna be okay? You're sleeping with my wife.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I mean, besides that.</p>", "6893": "<p><strong>Oliver:</strong> I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come here. I guess I just wanted to see who she replaced me with.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Don't say that. What you two had was special. No one can replace you.<br/><strong>Oliver:</strong> Did she say that?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No.</p>", "6894": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Look, if it makes you feel any better, I barely know her.<br/><strong>Oliver:</strong> And she had sex with you?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Nell tells me you're a fireman. What's that like?</p>", "6895": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, I'm really uncomfortable with him back in that room.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why? He hasn't made a peep all day.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You don't get it. All the years that we lived together, he drove me crazy the whole time.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And now he's not.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Exactly. Don't look at me like that. It-it-it means he did it on purpose. It was a choice. That-That's like finding out Godzilla could've had Arby's instead of Tokyo.</p>", "6896": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry. Am I being too loud?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, you're being perfect and you know it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would you like me to be a less considerate tenant?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. Yes. What? Stop messing with me!</p>", "6897": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> He was best friends with her older brother, but he didn't even notice her. And then years afterward, they randomly bumped into each other at the DMV. Two hours later, they were in love. You can really see the sparkle in his license photo.</p>", "6898": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> He told you all this at the planetarium?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, no, we went to House of Pies. He got banana cream. I got coconut. We did halfsies.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You did pie halfsies with another man?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You mean other than you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah.</p>", "6899": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I feel bad for him, Bernie. He's a, he's a good guy.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, if you're uncomfortable with it, maybe stop sleeping with his wife.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't think the sex is the problem. I know for a fact I was just okay.</p>", "6900": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> For the record, I'm the one who introduced you to House of Pies.</p>", "6901": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, if it gets to be too much, you can always send him back over here.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> I made a deal with him, and besides, that wouldn't be fair to you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, actually, I miss him. He's been over there a lot.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, great. Tell him he can come back.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I can't. He's thinking of me and my feelings and trying to be respectful.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's what he's doing to me, too, the jerk!</br></p>", "6902": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Stop that!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, your mad look and Sheldon's constipated look are the same.</p>", "6903": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Sorry, I can't do this.<br/><strong>Nell:</strong> What's going on?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I met Oliver the other day.<br/><strong>Nell:</strong> Wait, you tracked down my husband?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, that would be weird. He tracked me down, then we spent the evening together.</p>", "6904": "<p><strong>Nell:</strong> You're crazier than he is.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'll tell you what, just give him one more chance and if it doesn't work out, I'll be happy to keep sleeping with you.<br/><strong>Nell:</strong> You would?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Either way, you've got yourself a fella. Like, how nice is that?</p>", "6905": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey. So, your contract provides for a three-day trial period, and I don't think this is working out. So, to put it in legal terms, the party of the first part would like the party of the second part to get out.</p>", "6906": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What time does the trial period end?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> 12:00, noon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, what does it say after that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Eastern Standard Time.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That was three hours ago. And, uh, since you didn't exercise your right to revoke, I exercised my right to extend, triggering this long-form rental agreement of which you're already in violation.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> This is just a-a bunch of paper. You can't enforce this.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hire a lawyer. Let's find out.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> This is not happening.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Be that as it may, page nine says that you have to provide me with lemon-flavored sparkling waters, so chop-chop.</p>", "6907": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, how'd it go?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, apparently he's not leaving and I have to go get him sparkling water.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why are you smiling?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. It just feels right.</p>", "6908": "<p><strong>Oliver:</strong> Hey, buddy. I talked to Nell. She was pretty upset after you left.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, I'm sorry.<br/><strong>Oliver:</strong> No. No, no, no. She told me that you said something so creepy that I seemed great in comparison.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I know exactly what it was. No, actually, there was a couple of things it could've been. Whichever one it was, it was creepy.</p>", "6909": "<p><strong>Oliver:</strong> Anyway, uh, I went over to comfort her, and we talked, and I think we're gonna give it another chance.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I am so happy for you! Hey, uh, we should celebrate.<br/><strong>Oliver:</strong> House of Pies?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You know it.<br/><strong>Oliver:</strong> Should we invite Nell?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Do we have to?<br/><strong>Oliver:</strong> Nah.</p>", "6910": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey! Look what I got everybody.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Newspapers? Did you find a portal back to the 1990s?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No. If he had that, he'd be trying to prevent NSYNC from breaking up.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, please. I'm glad they broke up. Otherwise, Justin would never have brought sexy back.</p>", "6911": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> One thing you can't get on an iPad, the smell of ink and paper. One more reason iPads are better.</p>", "6912": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, look, they still have Far Side. Oh, I don't get that one.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, he's pushing when he should be pulling.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm. I don't think he belongs in that gifted school, then.</p>", "6913": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Making a boat. When I was a kid, my dad showed me how.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Boy, you'll do anything to avoid reading.</p>", "6914": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Guys, it's under \"Things to do this weekend.\"<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I can't find it. What does it say?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That it's a thing to do this weekend.</p>", "6915": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, how nice. Everyone's doing impressive work.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> What have you been working on these days?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Whoa, whoa. Where'd that come from?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where did what come from?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (stammers) I try to be supportive, and you break out the hot lights and the rubber hose.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I just asked what you've been working on.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, my God, let it go. Do you believe this guy?</br></p>", "6916": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, how do you want to play this? Do you want to pretend like nothing's bothering you and blow up later, or do you just want to be a maniac right now?</p>", "6917": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have a confession. When I berated Leonard, it was a clever ruse to conceal the fact that I'm not working on anything.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I think I speak for everyone when I say, \"No!\"</p>", "6918": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, maybe this is the perfect opportunity to take some time for yourself and refocus. I'm sure you'll find something you're excited about.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you, Amy. I don't know what I'd do without you.<br/>\n[cut to Amy entering Apartment 4A]<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, can I stay here? Sheldon kicked me out.</p>", "6919": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, uh, what do you think we should open our show with? Uh, \"Thor and Doctor Jones\" or \"Let's Get Astrophysical\"<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. I think we should start with something that gets them up on their feet. Maybe \"Sherlock Around the Clock.\"</p>", "6920": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. Scratch paper, check. Whiteboard, check. Chex Mix, check. And here we go.</p>", "6921": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> [cell phone rining] Oh, dang it. Hello, Mother.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Hi there, Shelly. You will never believe who I ran into at the barbecue festival.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am right in the middle of some very important work. I don't have time for this right now.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Then why did you answer the phone?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because you raised me to be polite. Now stop bothering me. [hangs up]</p>", "6922": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Hello again.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who did you see at the barbecue festival?<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Mr. Watkins.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? You called me and interrupted my work to tell me that you ran into somebody you could plausibly run into? I'm sorry, Mother, I really need to focus here. I will speak to you next week.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Okay, sweetheart. I'll talk to you then.</p>", "6923": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (sighs) I thought Mr. Watkins moved to Florida.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> He did. He was back visiting his son.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, gosh darn it, that is interesting. Was it Tommy or Joe? I bet it was Joe, 'cause he and Tommy had a falling out over that time-share.</p>", "6924": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You guys do anything fun after dinner?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, actually Amy came back over and we hung out. Did you know that we're both spelling bee champs? We stayed up for hours trying to stump each other.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Who won?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, she thought she had me with \"appoggiatura\" but I shut that down expeditiously. E-X-P-E-D-I-T-I-O-U-S-L-Y. Expeditiously.</p>", "6925": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Wow. I bet that made Penny take off all of her clothes. ... Put her pajamas on and then go to bed early.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> At, like, 9:00.</p>", "6926": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't want to be the one who breaks up the band. You know, maybe you should think about replacing me.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I mean, I know it'll be hard since we-<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, I bet Bert could do it. He plays guitar. I'm gonna go ask him.</p>", "6927": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I guess he forgot that I play the cello.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I-I don't think he did.</p>", "6928": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, I think it's ready.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Should we put on safety goggles?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, the funnest fun is the safest fun, so yes.</p>", "6929": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So what's all this?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, Amy and I were talking about old science fair projects, and how fun it would be to recreate them.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> We're making hot ice.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong>  It's pretty cool.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (chuckles) Nice one. (Amy and Leonard high five)</p>", "6930": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sorry, we don't have to do more experiments. Let's do something we can all enjoy.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, uh, you want to watch that show you like where people want to buy a house and then they do?</br></p>", "6931": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> No, no, you guys do your experiments. I'll go pick up dinner.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you sure?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, you're having science fun, and I don't want to interfere, or watch you.</p>", "6932": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did I actually do it? I did. I did. [picks up his phone and dials] The answer is one in 18 million.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> What is?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The odds of you running into Mr. Watkins.</p>", "6933": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh, Shelly. I have bad news. Mr. Watkins passed this morning.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> I know. What are the odds of that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Call you back.</p>", "6934": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> [3 knocks] Sheldon? [3 knocks] Sheldon? [3 knocks] Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's annoying when you do it.</p>", "6935": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have been working pretty hard. I could use a break.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What's that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, yeah, that is an experiment to see how many parallelograms I could draw while holding my breath.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> [pointing to the board] Is that where you blacked out?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> [pointing behind the couch] No, actually, that's where I blacked out.</p>", "6936": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> And this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That is a list of all the different types of natural disasters.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> \"Fire-quake\"?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I made that one up. Which I shouldn't have, because now I'm scared of it.</p>", "6937": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Maybe I'll just eat this in the laundry room.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, no. Wait. You don't have to go, as long as you sit quietly and don't say anything.</p>", "6938": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Hey, you want to hear one of my geology songs?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> So it's about rocks?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Better. It's about a boulder.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Isn't that the same thing?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Far from it. A boulder has a diameter greater than 25.6 centimeters.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Is that fact in the song?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> No ... yes.</p>", "6939": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Alone in my temple in the middle of Peru, A giant stone ball with nothing much to do, But if you steal my idol, I will roll right over you, 'Cause I'm six tons of granite and micaceous schist, Yeah, I'm six tons of granite and,<br/><strong>Both:</strong> Micaceous schist, Yeah, I'm six tons of granite and, micaceous schist, Yeah, I'm six tons of granite And, uh, micaceous schist Yeah, I'm six-</p>", "6940": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, I think if we want to predict the height of the wave, we need to use elasticity theory and model the lattice as one continuous flexible piece.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> This is fun.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mm-hmm.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Playing with Popsicle sticks, exploring ways to store kinetic energy. It's like preschool all over again.</p>", "6941": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Except now if I eat paste, it's because I want to, not because Craig Schultz is making me.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, can I ask you a question?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is it, \"Where was the teacher?\" She was in the bathroom smoking, that's where.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It wasn't, but I'm glad to see you've moved on.</p>", "6942": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I was gonna ask if being married felt any different.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, uh, not really. Sorry. That probably wasn't the answer you were looking for.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, actually it is. I mean, Sheldon and I are in a really great place right now, and I just, I don't want anything to mess that up.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mm-hmm. You do remember you're here because he kicked you out of your apartment?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes. His work is important to him. It's one of the things I find the sexiest about him. Well, that and-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aah! [setting off the lattice]<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> - his butt.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ugh.</p>", "6943": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And then I was thinking about inventing a new dark matter particle to evade the omega baryon constraints, but that just seems like something anyone could come up with.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mm. Agreed. You know what's blowing my mind? Somebody thought about putting cheese in this crust.</p>", "6944": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I just wish I could find something that excites me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You do understand that crust doesn't normally come with cheese in it?</p>", "6945": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What got you excited about dark matter in the first place?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I left string theory, which I'd been working on for a long time, and everyone was talking about how cool dark matter was, and I thought, \"\u20ac\u0153Well, sure, I'll give that a whirl\".<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So it's your rebound science?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's that?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, not the science you spend the rest of your life with, but the one you use to make yourself feel pretty again.</br></p>", "6946": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, if I'm being honest, I never forgot about string theory. It's remarkable. It's the closest we've come to a theory of everything, something even Einstein couldn't figure out.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, if he couldn't figure it out, maybe it's just wrong.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But it's so elegant. I mean, look, [drawing on his white board] string theory posits that the fundamental particles we see in three dimensions are actually strings embedded in multidimensional space-time.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Interesting. So that would mean ... that [silence] ... Can't do this by myself, buddy.</p>", "6947": "<p>[Howard playing keyboard in bed with headphones, making a clacking noise]<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What is happening?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I was trying not to wake you.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Did it work?</p>", "6948": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I just realized, now that I'm not in the band, I can focus on my own music. You know, go solo.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You said you were taking a break from the band to help with me and the baby.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes, and write an astronaut musical. Picture this. The curtain opens. There's a lone astronaut floating in the inky blackness of space. Maybe wires, maybe fog. I'll let the director figure that out. [playing the keyboard] \"I really don't know when I'll run out of oxy gen\".</p>", "6949": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Good news! I'm back in the band!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> So, Bernadette doesn't mind?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It was her idea!</p>", "6950": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So it's sort of like a guitar string, but instead of making an actual sound, each vibration is a different particle?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Precisely. And when you express it in 11 dimensions, Einstein's relativity equations pop out. Does that sound like a coincidence?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It does not.</p>", "6951": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, so, did we do it? Did we just solve string theory?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. (laughs) I appreciate your enthusiasm, but this is not the sort of thing we can figure out in a night. People have been stuck on this for decades.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What, decades? Really? It's-it's a string. How hard can it be? It's straight, it's in a loop, it gets knotted up with other strings.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, actually there are no knots in anything greater than four dimensions. Ooh, unless we get around that by considering them as sheets. You know, topologically speaking, that has a lot of interesting possibilities.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> See? How long did that take me, like a minute?</p>", "6952": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thought you were getting us dinner.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sorry. I had to stop at Sheldon's and help him solve string theory.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, turns out the answer's knots.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's cute, but you can't have knots in more than four dimensions.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mmm ...  you can if you consider them sheets. [chuckling] Good night.</p>", "6953": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What up, my Hebrews and She-brews?!</p>", "6954": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Toby, today you are a man, and you will face many obstacles in life.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> And some of those obstacles are gonna feel like boulders.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> This first song is about the greatest boulder in the history of cinema.</p>", "6955": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> (singing) Alone in my temple in the middle of Peru, A giant stone ball with nothing to do,<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> But if you steal my idol, I will roll right over you<br/><strong>All:</strong> Cause I'm six tons of granite, And micaceous schist, Yeah, I'm six tons of granite, And micaceous schist,<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> I'm gonna crush you, I'm gonna mush you, You took my idol, I'm homicidal, Gonna roll over you till your brains come out, And your bones will crunch and your blood will spout! I'm not just a rock, baby.<br/>\nI'm a boulder.<br/>\nAll: Cause I'm six tons of granite, And micaceous schist, Yeah, I'm six tons of granite, And micaceous schist, Yeah, I'm six tons of granite-</p>", "6956": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I remember telling Jenny Runyon that I would teach her how to flirt with boys if she put my name on her project. I got an \"A\", she got pregnant.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Girls like you are why I had to come straight home after school.</p>", "6957": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, I didn't think anything could top last night's spelling bee, but here comes math.</p>", "6958": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Too bad, you guys kill at bar mitzvahs. And other events that people can't leave.</p>", "6959": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm trying to come up with a new approach to dark matter, but people keep distracting me. First, my mother kept answering the phone when I called, even though she knew I was busy. And now you show up with my favorite shape of food - a circle made of triangles served in a square box.</p>", "6960": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I see your point. Okay, we are officially open to a best woman and a gentleman of honor.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, those names are terrible. One point off for you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What am I being tested for?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, it's not important. But if you don't pass, none of this matters.</br></p>", "6961": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Would you call yourself a loyal and trustworthy friend?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, I like to think so.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Great. Because I need to tell you something about Howard, but you can't tell him that I told you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Nope. Don't want to hear it. Do not like to engage in gossip.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay. I respect your integrity.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Is it about his special underwear? Because I already know. And that's all I'll say. Fine, it has a charcoal filter in it.</p>", "6962": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, dealing with cold feet is an important part of being both best man and maid of honor. Maybe we should test for that ability.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You really think you might get cold feet?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Actually, I was talking about you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy if there's one thing in this world I'm sure of, you are right to be worried.</p>", "6963": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> No, no, no, no, no. Uh, Aunt Orange can't sit next to the bar without Ms. Pink saying, \"Jesus thinks you've had enough whiskey.\"</p>", "6964": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Everything okay?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I secretly experimented on my friends, and now none of them want to be my best man. So, you know, normal wedding drama.</p>", "6965": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Probably have to use my stupid brother. So get ready for a wedding toast delivered by his armpit.</p>", "6966": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, if you really don't want to use your brother, I'd be your best man.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Yeah, we're friends. Plus, it'd be nice. Never really been called the best before. Or a man, for that matter.</p>", "6967": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello. I believe I owe the three of you an apology.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No argument here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> By experimenting on you, I realize I've violated your trust and possibly the Geneva Convention.</p>", "6968": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Stuart, I'm sorry if it's weird Sheldon made me best man instead of you.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> It's okay. I was best man for two whole days. No one can take that away from me. Except for Sheldon, when he did.</p>", "6969": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Fine, I'll do it. But do me a favor and unlock the liquor cabinet first.</p>", "6970": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, I don't know how I feel about all this baby-proofing. If Halley can't teach herself to walk down the stairs, then maybe that's nature's way of saying the Wolowitz line ends here.</p>", "6971": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What if we have a code word?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ooh, now you're speaking my catamaran. That's my code word for \"language.\"<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, fine, catamaran. That's our code word.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, that's my code word. Get your own.</p>", "6972": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You hear me say pretzels, you change the subject.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Rhinos are my least favorite animals at the zoo.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we started.</p>", "6973": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> That's funny. I always thought Howard was nature's way of saying the Wolowitz line ends here.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Me, too, but life does find a way!</p>", "6974": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, if Halley can't reach the liquor cabinet. why did you baby-proof it?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> How did you know we did?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Fair point.</p>", "6975": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Bernadette still going stir-crazy?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, a little. Two months of bed rest, it's kind of rough.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really? That sounds great. How do I get that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You'd either have to break your hip or let Howard knock you up.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Now, either way, you'll get flowers the next morning.</br></p>", "6976": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm really impressed at how you handled that, Howard.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Please. I've been sending food back my entire life. One of my first full sentences was, \"I had breast milk for breakfast!\"</p>", "6977": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know how many favors I had to call in with my bounce house guy to get Wonder Woman?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Is that Wonder Woman?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Technically, it's a Chinese knockoff called Happy Strong Swimsuit Lady.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Then I take it back; it's a great party.</p>", "6978": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't like kids, but I do like birthday cake. Oh, wait, will there be sugary icing flowers on it?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll risk it. But if I have a tantrum and have to leave early, you'll know why.</p>", "6979": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Don't stress about this party. She's one; she's not gonna remember. The other day I showed her her toe, and she was shocked.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's not for the baby; it's for Bernadette. She's feeling guilty about all the stuff she's missing with Halley.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> All right. Uncle Stuart's got your back. Ain't no party like a Stuart party because Stuart's never invited to parties.</p>", "6980": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I can't believe you pulled this all together overnight.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, if I had more time, I could have gotten the Blue Man Group. One of them goes to my dry cleaner. Who, by the way, hates him.</p>", "6981": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You really saved the day.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, it's not for you. It's for Halley.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And I'm sure she'd appreciate it, if she knew what's going on or who you are.</p>", "6982": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Morning. Happy birthday.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yeah, sure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did you sleep at all?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No. You?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I passed out on the toilet once. I don't know if that counts.</p>", "6983": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, no, I-I'm serious. If there's things we want to do, let's start doing them.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay. Well, we've never been on a big trip together.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I would love that.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, there's something for your letter: \"Considered going on a trip.\"</p>", "6984": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Those are the only other people you invited? What about the kids from the Daddy and Me class?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, grow up.</p>", "6985": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, I need some fashion advice.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really? From me? I would love to-<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Actually, Leonard told me Penny was over here...</p>", "6986": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'd be in charge of developing and narrating all the planetarium shows. And I really want this, so it wouldn't kill you to be more supportive.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But if it did, you could bury me at the funeral home you direct.</p>", "6987": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Son, don't take this the wrong way, but what's your problem?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I would tell you, but apparently it takes 45 minutes.</p>", "6988": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm so sorry the interview didn't go well.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, you would've been perfect for it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, I just get so nervous, and then I start apologizing for being nervous, and- You guys don't want to hear about this. I'm sorry.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Stop apologizing!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, my God! You sound just like the woman at the interview!</p>", "6989": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know what? I think we're both done being disrespected.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (Penny looks at Leonard) I got a few rounds left in me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Attaboy, champ.</p>", "6990": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Really? You're not gonna sit here?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> I'll sit there as soon as you leave.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're still on this? I said sorry.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, \"sorry\" doesn't make up for years of emotional abuse.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (sighs) Well, what's it gonna take? You want half my sandwich?</br></p>", "6991": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What is going on?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Raj is trying to blame me for his pathetic life.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> His life isn't pathetic. He's got that whole table to himself!</p>", "6992": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, good, you're here. I've decided on our centerpieces. I just hope your family isn't allergic to asbestos.</p>", "6993": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I came here to celebrate! Yeah. I went back to the planetarium and told them they were making a huge mistake, that I'd be perfect for the job. I was I was charming, I was confident. And they gave it to me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (chuckles) That's amazing!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, plus, it turns out the guy they hired got busted at a sketchy massage parlor.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, so happy ending for you! Oh, and for him.</p>", "6994": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Why are they making four more Avatar movies? It's not like the first one is even that good.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you talking about? You love that movie. You even went as Avatar for Halloween.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I remember. That was not a lot of clothes.</p>", "6995": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can't believe we forgot about it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's not that surprising. They were basically worthless when we got them.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I wish I knew how much we had.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon, you must remember.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course I do.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, yeah, he and I totally remember. You tell them, Sheldon.</p>", "6996": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I can't believe you haven't seen Avatar yet. What is wrong with you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny and I just started dating, and you know I don't like big crowds.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Because you're afraid Penny will leave you for someone in them?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Terrified.</p>", "6997": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, instead of going out, they just stay home and have constant coitus.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I didn't want to say it, but I-I do like to hear it.</p>", "6998": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fine, I'm mad. I guess I was more upset by our breakup than you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That is not true. Of course I was upset.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Didn't seem like it. You started dating the first tall, handsome hunk you could find.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm sorry, are you mad that I dated Zack or that you didn't?</p>", "6999": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'm, uh, I'm running a special today, uh, buy something, keep having a comic book store to come to.</p>", "7000": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Everything okay?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, there's just something I need to ask you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (gasps) Oh, Bernie, I'd be thrilled.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's not be my birth coach.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, that hurts, but luckily I know how to breathe through it.</p>", "7001": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I know I sound paranoid, but I'm feeling really vulnerable. If there's anything you could find out, it'd be great.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And if she is up to anything, what are you gonna do?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Nothing. I'll just calmly talk to her and explain there are certain boundaries that need to be respected. It's really for the benefit of everyone at the company.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, okay, what you're saying sounds nice, but the way you're saying it is causing my testicles to take cover in my abdomen.</p>", "7002": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know what, you like to think that you're just like Tesla, but the truth is you're exactly like Edison.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You take that back!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, he's right. You are a bully, a credit hog and a self-promoter. And if anyone around here is like Tesla, it's us.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (long pause) Yeah.</p>", "7003": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, you are building on their work and taking the credit for it. That's a classic Edison move.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, yeah? Well, if I'm Edison and you love me, then what does that say about you?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I honestly don't know.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. Well, I have to Google some stuff about Mrs. Edison. I'll be right back.</p>", "7004": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I never would've undermined a coworker.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What? Oh, please. Wh-What about that guy Eric, who you told it was \"Bring Your Cat to Work Day\" when you knew your boss had asthma?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That was just a hilarious prank that ended with me getting a corner office.</p>", "7005": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So what do you think? Can you make it work?<br><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Uh, I just need to use the cross section to calculate the probability of the interaction.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can we help?<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Yes. Why don't you run get me a can of Pringles.</br></p>", "7006": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, I was- What's Kripke doing here?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, he's just helping us develop a better, more efficient neutrino comm system that we're gonna pitch to the military, making yours obsolete.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, Leonard thought of it. It's genius.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, thanks. You see, instead of using liquid helium-<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Good God, man, shut up!</p>", "7007": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I can't believe she dumped me.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> This is tough for me, 'cause I can.</p>", "7008": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Based on Kripke's calculations, I think this is gonna work. Maybe we should pitch it to Colonel Williams today.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why limit ourselves to the U.S. military? I bet there's a lot of other places we could take this.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Without committing criminal espionage?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, it's easy to shoot an idea down, Leonard.</p>", "7009": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> She's right. Maybe we're all a bunch of Teslas after all.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Didn't Tesla die penniless, forgotten and insane?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (sighs) You may have a point about her social skills.</p>", "7010": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hold on. Where is he?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, according to his text, he was on the second floor, then he stopped to tie his shoe. (phone chimes) All tied, and-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sorry we're late. Amy took forever tying my shoe.</p>", "7011": "<p><strong>Ruchi:</strong> This place seems nice.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, but not too nice. Yelp called it \"good for  groups.\"</p>", "7012": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I just thought we could, you know, hang out and go to a bar.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Very well.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sounds fun.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And watch cricket. (silence)<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That sound you hear, ironically, crickets.</p>", "7013": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I hope this isn't awkward. The last time we met, I kind of embarrassed myself.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Let's see if you can go two for two.</p>", "7014": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Are you here by yourself?<br/><strong>Ruchi:</strong> Yeah, I couldn't convince anyone to come watch cricket with me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (chuckles) Tell me about it. I had to drag this guy.</p>", "7015": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (on the phone) Hello, Amy. (stammers) What do you mean, where am I? I'm in my office.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, I'm at your office and you're not here. I thought I'd surprise you with dinner.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For future reference, the best surprises are the ones I know about three days in advance.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Where are you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's a surprise. Doesn't feel so good, does it?</p>", "7016": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What can I do for you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just a minute, I want to make sure Leonard can't hear us. (loudly) I've got a box of cupcakes. (silence) Okay, we're good.</p>", "7017": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Good morning! Scones?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Ah, thanks.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> They're all for you; I already had breakfast at Ruchi's.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're kidding. You slept with her?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, there wasn't a lot of sleeping involved. I mean, she slept, I stayed awake. I was afraid of snoring 'cause I didn't have my special pillow.</p>", "7018": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> So, you and Ruchi?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, I'm sorry. I know you liked her, too, but we just bumped into each other last night and hit it off.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> No, that's fine. You're my friend and I'm happy for you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, thank you, Stuart.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Plus, I don't know how you're gonna screw it up, but I know you will.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What's there to screw up? She just wants to keep things casual.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, great, that's how you're gonna screw it up.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, I can be casual.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Mm-hmm. I should get a haircut. This thing's going south fast.</p>", "7019": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So you're not gonna see her again?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What's the point? We're never gonna be in a real relationship.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Right, so you'll only be in a physical one?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Exactly. Why would I want to spend time with someone like that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Someone who is just interested in sex?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Raj, do you real-<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Whoa, hold on. Give him a chance. He's gonna get this. (Raj staring blankly)<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't think he is.</p>", "7020": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What is there to get? She doesn't want to fall in love. At that point, all we are is two single people who find each other attractive and enjoy having-- Oh, got to go!</p>", "7021": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know who'd make a great Professor Proton? Meryl Streep.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> She's not a scientist.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, then explain to me why she has chemistry with literally everyone.</br></p>", "7022": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, my goodness.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> If it's \"vasectomy gone wrong\" videos, he's seen them all. Including the one of the guy who's sitting on what appears to be a cantaloupe but is not.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (putting his plate of food own) And I'm done.</p>", "7023": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hang on, I have a question. Do you have any experiments that aren't life-threatening?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Come on! That was a perfect take, and you ruined it. Oh, look! Hey, I did need enraged.</p>", "7024": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really hurts, huh?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No. He's just saying, \"Ow can these prices be so low?\".</p>", "7025": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's gonna be okay. A day or two of rest, and you'll be fine.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know nothing about Jewish people.</p>", "7026": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It says here that I need to check the area for redness and swelling.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know what? It hurts so much, go ahead.</p>", "7027": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hi, guys. Wanted to check in and see how you two were doing.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We're okay.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, hanging out in bed with my wife, thawing out some frozen peas in my pants-- living the dream.</p>", "7028": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Trust me, you guys have nothing to worry about. You know, back in Nebraska, I raised all our baby pigs right until the day they were slaughtered. So, unless your baby's made of breakfast meat, she's fine.</p>", "7029": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Now I feel bad.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, she never really liked me. It's kind of nice she hates you now, too.</p>", "7030": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> See, he gets Ewoks in his bed.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You've got Chewbacca. That's enough.</p>", "7031": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, no more stories about sex, so, Amy, that brings us to you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, at work we've been doing some interesting research with neuroprosthetics.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Neat. I've been rewatching The O.C., so we're all leading productive lives.</p>", "7032": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> We've been working on a computer interface that can use brain wave patterns to control robotic limbs, but we're having a little trouble localizing the signal from the EEG cap.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, well, have you thought about adding a phased array of sensors for better localization?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Actually, that never occurred to me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It never occurred to me I would miss the Ewok conversation.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Good, because I just bought another one on Amazon.</p>", "7033": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, I could use an engineer on this project.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, now, this works out great. Howard's an engineer. I'm sure he knows someone qualified.</p>", "7034": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Bernadette left it here.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah? Anything interesting?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I just saw a picture of a baby's head crowning, so I hope you enjoyed sex, because we're done with that.</p>", "7035": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, Sheldon, what's up?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, remember how disappointed you were when Amy started driving me to work?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure, uh, sometimes people smile a big smile of disappointment.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, well, good news, Amy had to go in early to show Howard around her lab, so you get to drive me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aw, his smile of disappointment has turned into a frown of joy.</br></p>", "7036": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So Howard and Amy working together, that's interesting, huh?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Eh, it's all right, I suppose. Uh, when- Usually when Amy complains about her coworkers, I just tune her out, but now I'll be able to join in and pound away.</p>", "7037": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I came to see how you were doing. Like, uh, do you need help with anything?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, thank you. There are a few things around the house that I've been waiting for Howard to get to. The smoke alarms-<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, I meant emotionally. How are you feeling?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Like you're not really here to help me.</p>", "7038": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Everything's fine. Howard's really excited about his work, he's been in a great mood I'm really proud of him.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And I can fit into the pants I wore in high school. Come on, we don't need to lie to each other.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're right. I have a teething baby, I'm pregnant, I have a proposal due tomorrow. I don't have time to hear about how much you're missing my husband.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I think I know why he's been working so late.</p>", "7039": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Welcome home. How was work?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Great. Howard had an idea for-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (waving his hand dismissively) That's enough about work.</p>", "7040": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Here we go. \"Let him have ownership of his choices. Allow him to choose from options that are acceptable to you.\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, I'll give it a try. \"I can drive you in two hours or you can take an Uber\"<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Good. See, now he feels like he has a choice.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Huh. (phone chimes) He's gonna take an Uber.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, it worked.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Unless he bites the driver, yeah.</p>", "7041": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And now they're working on a Saturday? Can you believe them? Like, is this how you envisioned your weekend?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, it is not.</p>", "7042": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This whole thing is maddening.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm really busy. I don't have time to listen to you complain.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey! You're complaining, too. \"Sheldon, why are you here?\" \"Sheldon, the applesauce is for the baby.\"</p>", "7043": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, wait, now, hold on. Why'd you ask me about Tom Sawyer?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm just interested in you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, you are sweeter than your applesauce.</p>", "7044": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You think that's impressive, take apart that brain model.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh my God, three of clubs. That was my card! How did you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I used to make it appear in my pants, but HR said I had to stop doing that.</p>", "7045": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Guys, you won't believe this. I stopped by the university to check in on Howard and Amy, and they were having fun.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, don't worry. He won't be having any fun when he gets home. I did all his favorite chores!</p>", "7046": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So is this how it's gonna be if we have kids? You're just gonna throw me under the bus?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If you spoil them the way you do Sheldon, then, yeah.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, my way was working. Okay? I think you're just upset because there are some things I am better than you at.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, you can't end a sentence with a preposition, so clearly not grammar.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> If you're so smart, was that a smart thing to say?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That depends. Before I said it, was sex tonight still on the table?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Then it's fine.</p>", "7047": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's okay. We're all here to help.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. And this baby will have plenty of manly role models. Now, I'm certain that whatever Bernadette can't teach him, Penny can.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, she can pee into a bottle.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mm-hmm. Anything with a neck wider than a nickel.</p>", "7048": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, where are you going?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Back to the dry cleaner. Look at this. They didn't get the stain out of my Starfleet uniform.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, if you didn't make me wear the green body paint in bed, you wouldn't have to get it dry-cleaned so much.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Nah, it's worth it.</p>", "7049": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I haven't looked at all this stuff in years.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Had it. Had it. Burnt down my garage with it.</p>", "7050": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I had three model rockets as a kid, and that was the largest space program in India.</p>", "7051": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Could never bring myself to open it without him. It's silly.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, it's not silly. I always wanted my dad to build rockets with me, but he wasn't interested.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ah, yes, disappointing fathers. Tell me about it. I remember for my 16th birthday, my dad bought me a Mercedes. Like, a little one, like a starter Mercedes. He had barely handed me the keys before he had to rush back to work. I didn't see him again till, like, pretty late that night.</br></p>", "7052": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Wow, you're really good at this.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, please. This isn't my first time turning girl clothes into boy clothes.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why? You got your sister's hand-me-downs?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (unconvincingly) Yeah, that.</p>", "7053": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, I should've brought peanuts.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You can't eat peanuts. You're allergic. If you die, who's going to drive me home?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm not gonna eat them. It's a thing they do at JPL. When the Ranger mission finally had a successful launch, there were peanuts in the room. Ever since then, they have them at every launch.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That sounds like a silly superstition.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's more of a tradition.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh! I do love a tradition. Could you pull over at the next peanut store?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't think that's a real thing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, don't be pedantic. Any nut store will do.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't think we can get peanuts out here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah, well, then this whole day's ruined.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Now that I think about it, maybe it is more of a superstition.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Whew! That was close.</p>", "7054": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> All right. Here we go. L-minus ten, nine-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, what are you doing? It's \"T-minus\".<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I was an astronaut. We used L-minus.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But this is a Saturn V, and when they launched those, they said \"T-minus\"<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's my rocket! We're doing it my way.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. I'm not saying I know why your dad left, but I think I'm getting an idea.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> L-minus ten, nine, eight, seven, six-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> 'Cause you're kind of bossy.</p>", "7055": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, what am I gonna do? I mean, what do I know about raising a boy?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What do you know about raising a girl?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, my God, you're right.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I don't know if that was sarcasm or not.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So, either you're welcome, or hey!</p>", "7056": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard, did you really just text me from the couch to put extra mustard on your sandwich?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I was worried you might not check your e-mail.</p>", "7057": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> No, I think she's lonely. She's been reaching out.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, just be careful. You think you're getting close to her, and the next thing you know, you're featured in a book called He's Doing It On Purpose: Raising a Teenage Bed-Wetter.</p>", "7058": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, hey, hey, what do you think?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Just because it's a boy, I don't think you need to put a picture of genitals on his shirt.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> But that's a baseball bat with two little baseballs. Okay, and now I see it.</p>", "7059": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You don't know what this little boy's gonna be like. Maybe he'll be rough and tumble, or maybe he'll be sweet and sensitive, or maybe he'll be all those things, like me.</p>", "7060": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What's up?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny's been talking to my mother like they're best friends, and it's kind of freaking me out.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay I'm pretty sure they're not best friends. 'Cause you can only have one best friend. And Penny has that, and (clicks tongue) it's me.</p>", "7061": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Then why don't you ever drive yourself?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Honestly, I barely passed my test. And the one time I drove on my own, I made a U-turn, got dizzy, threw up and walked home.</p>", "7062": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Hi, Pen- Oh, hello, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hello, Mother. How are you?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Fine. And you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm great.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Well, it's been lovely catching up.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait. Hang on. We need to talk.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oh, brother.</p>", "7063": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, ever since I was a young girl, I've dreamed of a June wedding, maybe on a cliff overlooking the ocean at sunset.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sure. Sounds wonderful. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go clean up. (To himself) Outdoor wedding. I know what I'll be using that cliff for.</p>", "7064": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good morning.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Good morning. I know today is Apple Jacks day, but we're all out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's fine. I'll have anything.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah. You know whatev.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> \"Whatev\"? I like this side of you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know what I like? Smooth jazz. (plays \"Feels So Good\")<br/>\n-Amy wakes up in bed next to Sheldon, who is humming the same tune-</p>", "7065": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, maybe this is a part of Sheldon's personality he's been repressing. I mean, I think we dream about things we wish we could be in real life.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Really? What do you dream about?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. Uh, being the wife of Leonard. Mostly that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I choose to believe you.</br></p>", "7066": "<p><strong>Ruchi:</strong> Well, moving to a new city was a little scary, but the job seems great. Everyone's really nice.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, they are. Super nice. I mean, only one of them took you out tonight, but it's not a competition.</p>", "7067": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know me, I just go with the flow. Beach, public pool, they both sound awesome. On second thought, beach. I'd like to befriend a seagull.</p>", "7068": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I couldn't help but wonder if it meant something.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, it doesn't.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you sure? I mean, the prefrontal cortex regulates impulse control. So it's plausible that when we're asleep, aspects of our personality that we repress might come out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't try to put science lipstick on your New Age pig! And for the record, you make noises when you sleep, and I've never accused you of repressing your inner chainsaw.</p>", "7069": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> If you want me to object at your wedding, just give me one of these. (taps on his nose)</p>", "7070": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm just saying, you should bow out.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Why should I bow out?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, because we all know how this is gonna end.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> That's what my doctor said, too, but I'm still here.</p>", "7071": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Howard, Bernadette was there last night. Did she say anything when she got home?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, she said, \"Why'd you tell those idiots where I was? Thanks a lot.\"</p>", "7072": "<p><strong>Ruchi:</strong> It's too bad Stuart couldn't make it. He seemed fun.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, yeah, he is. I love him dearly, yeah. Not to say that I don't worry about him.<br/><strong>Ruchi:</strong> What's to worry about?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You know what? I'm talking out of school. Speaking of which, he's allowed to live near them now.</p>", "7073": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I told him his voice was annoying. He didn't want to listen.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're saying it's not?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Just ... hey.</p>", "7074": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, calm down. Everybody just cool it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, let 'em go. If we get lucky, maybe one of them will start crying.</p>", "7075": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, since you sort of asked, I actually had a very good day. Got some new equipment for my lab.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, congratulations. I got some new equipment, too. I got these markers. They smell like fruit.<br/>\nWhich I did not notice when I bought them. (sniffs) Don't really care for it.</p>", "7076": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Here, drink this. It might help.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What if it doesn't?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, that's why I brought the bottle.</p>", "7077": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> No one would talk to me in the halls. They just glared at me. It's like high school all over again.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I would totally do high school all over again. But that doesn't help you.</p>", "7078": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I got called in to the administration office.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, look at my bad boy getting called to the principal.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We don't technically have a principal. There's a standing committee that oversees the budget.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, look at my bad boy answering questions nobody asked.</p>", "7079": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, on the bright side, after working together for 15 years, you finally get to hear me say, \"You were right.\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, you did.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How's it feel?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Given I might be unemployed, bittersweet.</p>", "7080": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, wow. He's buried with his wife.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> We get it. A lady loved you. Quit bragging.</br></p>", "7081": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> This guy knew how to live. He taught himself musical instruments. He studied Portuguese just to give a speech in Brazil.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> The only part of me that's been to Brazil is my bikini line.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (taking the Romulan ale away from Raj) Okay.</p>", "7082": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, how are you guys doing with all the new events in your  womb?</p>", "7083": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, congratulations. I'm so happy for you two. Hold on, I have to tell Bernadette. Hey, Bernie, guess what? Sheldon and Amy got engaged. Can you believe it?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (In the bathroom with a pregnancy test) Oh, my God. I cannot believe it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She's so happy I think she's crying.</p>", "7084": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Is everything okay?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Look, I'm gonna tell you something, but you can't freak out, because I'm already freaking out.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, my God, what is it?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm pregnant again.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (excitedly) Wha-? ... (quietly) Interesting.</p>", "7085": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, look, look, this is a good thing. Halley's gonna have a little brother or sister to play with.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I guess that would be pretty cute.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And, you, know, I was a surprise to my parents, and my dad said it was the best thing that ever happened to them.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay. Maybe this baby actually is a blessing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, my God, honey, of course it is.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (exhales) How am I pregnant again?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, what were you thinking?</p>", "7086": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey. Want me to make dinner?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Uh, sure, but first, why don't you have a seat? There's something I need to show you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Ooh, if it's how to make dinner, that'd be great.</p>", "7087": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, no offense, but your colleagues were pretty rude.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really, they were rude?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. They just kept talking about you and how great you are, no matter how many times I brought me up.</p>", "7088": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Do it! Have a baby, do it!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Come on, it'd be so cute, our kids playing together? What do you say, why don't you two hit the old mattress and whip up a family?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, we're not gonna have a baby just to make you guys feel better.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, if we're gonna have a baby it's gonna be when we are ready, or when I'm certain Penny is gonna leave me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Exactly.</p>", "7089": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> They're my friends, and I should be happy for them. And I'm trying, but all I feel is this gnawing, empty sensation in my gut.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I had that once. Turned out it was a tapeworm.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Cool.</p>", "7090": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, let me see the ring.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ooh, nice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, her eyes are up there.</p>", "7091": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Do you really think there's reason to worry?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, she's definitely going after Sheldon.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I made a play for her and she shot me down.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, well, that doesn't prove anything.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, there's a million reasons a woman would shoot Raj down.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Like, really, a million?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Fine, hundreds.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you.</p>", "7092": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, Sheldon, have you talked to Amy?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, we Skyped this morning and I'm sure I'll check in with her before I go to sleep.<br/><strong>Ramona Nowitzki:</strong> Sheldon talks about her all the time. I can't wait to meet her.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That is true. She keeps asking how long Amy's going to be gone.</p>", "7093": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> It's so strange. Earlier today, I ended a sentence with a preposition, and you weren't there to correct my grammar.</p>", "7094": "<p><strong>Ramona Nowitzki:</strong> No, my work doesn't leave me a lot of time for relationships.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I think you made that very clear.</p>", "7095": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that exactly what we were supposed to stop from happening?<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I threw my body at them, what else did you want me to do?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You think you should call Amy?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You got fingers and a mouth, you call her.</br></p>", "7096": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What is Leonard doing calling you at this hour?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's not important.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I must tell you, that seems a little inappropriate. Don't you agree?<br/><strong>Ramona Nowitzki:</strong> I do.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> See? We both think so.</p>", "7097": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> We need to talk.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wh-- Is this about Leonard and Amy? I don't like it either.</p>", "7098": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right. What do you think is happening?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think Dr. Nowitzki is a friendly colleague. I think you and Leonard need to see a marriage counselor. And I need to update my rsum to include swimming as a special skill.</p>", "7099": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> If you'd like, we can help you out.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, that would be great.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I mean, not me, I've got a wife and child, but this one posts video of himself flossing on Instagram.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It was a tutorial. And yes, I'm happy to keep Sheldon company.</p>", "7100": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment.<br/><strong>Ramona Nowitzki:</strong> Not 'til you tell me about your latest paper on quantum loop theory.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. You must be one of those dessert before dinner people.</p>", "7101": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And get this, I saw an articulating ladder with dual-leg leveling, which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sounds like a big night.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah. Raj made the funniest joke, he said, \"Which is the best ladder to use to hang myself?\"</p>", "7102": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She's always been a huge fan of my work, and now she's doing research at Caltech.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Huge fan, you say?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. I think you'd like her. She's extremely intelligent, just like you. Unlike you, she's tall, blonde and used to be an Olympic swimmer.</p>", "7103": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> We thought you meant not letting him run out into traffic.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Which he only did once.</p>", "7104": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Actually, I was going to suggest me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Great. Anybody's better than, (glancing at Stuart) mmm.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Excuse me. They took out my spleen and gallbladder, not my feelings.</p>", "7105": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> We should call Guinness, that might be a record.</p>", "7106": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> She's clearly having a working lunch and preferred to eat alone.<br/><strong>Ramona Nowitzki:</strong> Dr. Cooper, over here.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I could have made her very happy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You kept walking. I think you did.</p>", "7107": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, it's nice of you to acknowledge us, but this is your accomplishment.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, you guys did this all on your own.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Without me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> To success without Raj!</p>", "7108": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Bert has a room for rent.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So you're gonna be roommates with Bert?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, no, it's, uh, pretty private, actually, it's over his garage. So the only time I'll see him is when he pulls his car in, does his laundry or practices drums in my dining room.</p>", "7109": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, good for you. Mm-hmm. I actually have a little news myself.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, we're just gonna circle back to when he's moving out? Okay, that's cool.</p>", "7110": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, did you tell him about Princeton yet?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> No, I'm waiting till he's in a good mood.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, sweetie, you might not live that long.</br></p>", "7111": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't know, maybe I shouldn't go.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, stop it, he'll be fine.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I guess. And he'll have you and Leonard right across the hall the whole time.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, damn, wait, you know, maybe you shouldn't go-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Got to go! (Hangs up the phone)</p>", "7112": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Morning.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I apologize for exceeding my allotted bathroom time.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you feeling okay?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not really. Apparently grief can make one less regular.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I sat and I sat, but to no avail.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, the-the more details, the more sorry.</p>", "7113": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Really? He doesn't put raisins or banana slices or anything in it?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't think plain oatmeal was the point of that story.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I mean, I like a little brown sugar-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Guys!</p>", "7114": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're excited about this opportunity, right?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Of course. I get to be part of the first team to use radon markers to map the structures that-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, a simple yes will do.</p>", "7115": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, are you excited to have your own place again?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I am, but I'll miss you guys.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ah, we'll miss you, too.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, you could try saying that without smiling.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm trying. This is the best I can do.</p>", "7116": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Does this mean you're okay with me going?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I'm not looking forward to it, but it is a wonderful opportunity and you need to take it. Besides, Princeton is in New Jersey, so it's not like you're gonna want to stay.</p>", "7117": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've been doing a little research on New Jersey, and I was delighted to learn that their chief agricultural product is sod.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Is it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm, yes. Yeah, perhaps I've been harder on them than they deserve.</p>", "7118": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And you'll text me when you arrive at the airport?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I will.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And when you're at the gate?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Uh-huh.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And if you see any actors from Game of Thrones in first class?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't know what they look like, but sure.</p>", "7119": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And don't forget to Skype me when you arrive.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I won't.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And every morning.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Got it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now of course, my 9:00 a.m. is your noon, so let's avoid the whole \"good morning,\" \"good afternoon\" minefield, and let's just say, \"Hello.\"<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Good thinking.</p>", "7120": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Champagne, champagne, and for the world's tallest second grader, apple juice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No bendy straw? Some party.</p>", "7121": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh come on, he's a grown man. He can take care of himself.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You really believe that?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Once again, you got me.</p>", "7122": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, challenge them again.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Doing it right now. Oh, they can't. There's an important Little League game tomorrow.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No wonder they beat us, they're jocks.</p>", "7123": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, but it's not just video games. I downloaded the new O.S. for my phone. Took me a week to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, so our love is not real?</p>", "7124": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I guess I just need to face it, I'm no longer a wunderkind. Now I just wonder what's for lunch.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hot dogs.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yay.</p>", "7125": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Hey, we should all have dinner sometime.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, yeah, sure, I'll check with Leonard.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Cool, I'll check with Sara. (To his phone) Sara, pull up my calendar. It never works for me.</br></p>", "7126": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've been thinking about our recent humiliation.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're gonna have to be more specific.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> At the hands of those teenagers.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> More.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Boy teenagers.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, the video game. Yeah, that was bad.</p>", "7127": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on, I spent an entire plane ride with you talking about the trailer for Deadpool 2.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ha! I knew you weren't asleep.</p>", "7128": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, where's your fiance?<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Oh, she couldn't make it. She had an emergency.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, no, what happened?<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> I didn't ask.</p>", "7129": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What smells so good?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Raj is teaching me to make croissants.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Is this part of your super-aging?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. Yeah, it seemed daunting at first, but then I realized, it's like the chemistry set I had as a kid.<br/>\nOnly, when your brother eats this, no one has to call Poison Control.</p>", "7130": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, clearly mental tasks are not enough. Maybe you need to challenge your motor skills.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For the last time, I am not having a tickle fight with you.</p>", "7131": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So the key is, the moment one ball is at the top of its arc, you toss the next one.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, I think I got that.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Uh, h-hold on. There's an old saying in juggling.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Is it \"I'm going to die alone\"?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, it's \"if you want to have fun, start with one.\" Yours we think, but we do not say.</p>", "7132": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just to be on the safe side, am I in any danger of getting juggler's elbow?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you sure? 'Cause I'm feeling a twinge.</p>", "7133": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Where did you get it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard said I could borrow it, Bernadette said forever.</p>", "7134": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So you told her she was being dumb?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I told her she was being not smart. Which was dumb.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why did you even go to dinner with the guy?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We covered this, I'm dumb.</p>", "7135": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You know what? I'm with Leonard, this isn't cool.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I disagree. Penny is a strong, independent woman. The more you try to control her, the more she'll push back.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So you think it's okay?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, no, she's gonna leave you for someone, might as well get it over with.</p>", "7136": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm returning this stuff to Howard.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, Bernadette made me promise if you didn't want it, we'd give it to a homeless clown.</p>", "7137": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What happened to learning the unicycle?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I stopped that, it was dumb. Uni, bi, tri, menstrual, all cycles are dumb.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You said juggling was dumb, too.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, it is. If I wanted to hold three things at once, I'd wear cargo pants.</p>", "7138": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What are you reading?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This article says the peak age for making a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is 40.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, I'm running out of time.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's ridiculous, you're a brilliant man. The best years of your life are still ahead of you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, you have to say that, you're sweet on me.</p>", "7139": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, if you're really worried about your career, maybe you should consider spending a little less time with video games and comic books.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey! I thought you were sweet on me.</p>", "7140": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mind you, when we say \"behind the flags\", we don't literally mean these flags. That's just where we have dinner.</p>", "7141": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Hey, Sheldon. Hey, Amy. It's Bert.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, Bert. What is your flag-related comment or query?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> I have a girlfriend.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And what does that have to do with flags?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Nothing. I just wanted everyone to know I have a girlfriend.</br></p>", "7142": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Bert, you're tying up the line. My apologies to all of you trying to call in with legitimate flag comments.</p>", "7143": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Hey, guys.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, hello.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey. Want to join us?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But he's a geologist, and I have more physics jokes.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, quick! Sit!</p>", "7144": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Bert, Rebecca. I'd like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier.<br/><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Don't worry about it. It's fine.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> See? It was fine. I didn't need a time-out.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It  wasn't a time-out. Let's get some food.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You made me sit on the stairs and think about what I did.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Get your food!</p>", "7145": "<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> I could give you some free sessions.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, is that offer for everybody?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (chuckles) Nice try. I'm not going.</p>", "7146": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> She's so perfect, sometimes I think she isn't real. And then she goes to the bathroom, and I know she is.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aw, that's so weird.</p>", "7147": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, on our first date, Leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And we lived happily ever after.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> The end.</p>", "7148": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Hello? Is anybody home?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is that Bert?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> It's Bert.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I think it's Bert.</p>", "7149": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> If you're that upset, go get her back.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> I tried. She's not answering my calls. Which really hurts because I bought her that phone.</p>", "7150": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, sweetie, relationships aren't about money, okay? It's about respect and having things in common and- Yes, Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You and Leonard don't have anything in common. Maybe you should break up.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (To Penny) You called on him.</p>", "7151": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Let me just say good-bye. (Taps the glass) Halley. (Hits the glass) Look at Mommy. (Hits the glass) Over here, honey. (Pounding the glass)Say good-bye to Mommy! Look at me! Look at your mother!<br/>\n*Babies crying*<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> All right, we can go.</p>", "7152": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, Raj, do you want to go with me tomorrow?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Are you asking because you want me there or out of pity? Actually, never mind, don't answer. I'd love to.</p>", "7153": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And for your information, the summer conference on algebraic topology at Caltech is nerd prom.</p>", "7154": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Gentlemen, I've got Amy up and running. Shall we get to work?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Uh, before we do, what are you wearing, oh, friend who we pretend is normal?</p>", "7155": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You okay?<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Of course, why?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, I don't know, you seem a little upset.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, I'm fine.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You sure?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Why don't you think she's fine? She sounds fine, she looks fine. If I saw her on the street I'd say, \"Damn, that girl's fine!\"</br></p>", "7156": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why am I naked from the waist down?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know where your pants are, but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove.</p>", "7157": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, I know she's mad at me about something.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, what have you done that would upset her?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, gosh, how much time do you have?</p>", "7158": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You're not going to prison.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But, boy, it is funny to think about.</p>", "7159": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I didn't want to tell you, but I'm having a really tough time about going back to work.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. Okay, well, I get that. It was hard for me when I went back.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It was?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Of course. I missed you, and the baby, and being able to watch Ellen every day.</p>", "7160": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What? You hold my hand, you kiss my mouth, but you draw the line at 102 fever? What happened to our love?</p>", "7161": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Look, something's going on with Bernadette. She say anything to you?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, nope, not a word.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Come on, be honest. Did you tell her I tried her breast pump?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> No, but I did mention it to my therapist.</p>", "7162": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I bet Jennifer gets a promotion out of this, which is so unfair because I work twice as hard as she does.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Don't worry, Jerry won't be fooled by that type of behavior.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Jerry?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It didn't work for Randy, it didn't work for Tina, it sure as hell isn't gonna work for Jennifer.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I hope not. I just hate when people play those kinds of games.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Tina?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> With your sales record, you have nothing to worry about.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mm.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I went to your office Christmas party?</p>", "7163": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe I've made some progress on our ground rules.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, good. What are they?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, uh, number one: in matters of physics, I have the final say. In matters of neuroscience, you have the final say. Unless I disagree.</p>", "7164": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Number three. To avoid getting frustrated, we take built-in breaks and reward our successes with a small treat.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ooh, that sounds fun. Now, we're talking about real treats, right? Not Bible verses like my mother used to give me.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Whatever you want.</p>", "7165": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Look at that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, this is remarkable.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So we're agreed: it's complete garbage.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> By the way, your name can go first.</p>", "7166": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Nice. 174 diapers. That ought to get us to Wednesday.</p>", "7167": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, have you talked to them about it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, what am I supposed to say-- \"Stop having fun without me\"?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> This one says that every time I go out. See? I listen to you.</p>", "7168": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, either blow your nose or teach it to play \"Camptown Races.\"</p>", "7169": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, boy, if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose, we'd be in good shape.</p>", "7170": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sure I'm overreacting.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're entitled to feel how you feel. If you don't like it, you should just talk to her.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't want to sound like a jealous baby.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, then maybe you shouldn't talk to her.</br></p>", "7171": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> We're finally making progress. I wish we could do it without fighting.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What if the fighting is the reason we're making progress?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I suppose it's conceivable that the hormones associated with our fight-or-flight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, if that's the case, then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture.</p>", "7172": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It seems we have a choice to make. Abandon all ground rules in the name of science, or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> There's only one clear choice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Science it is.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, you bonehead!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Name-calling, that is perfect. Now, when I get to this equation here, really let me have it. You know? If it helps, I'm not the sharpest dresser.</p>", "7173": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It's nice to see you taking an interest in Amy's work.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, don't get me wrong. Neurobiology's nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff. But, you know, when it connects to physics, gas up the Ford, Martha, we're going for a drive.</p>", "7174": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You took my room. You turned my friends against me. I hope you're happy.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What do I have to be happy about? My life's a wreck.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How come he can say it and I can't?</p>", "7175": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Hello, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why are you saying we have marital problems? We don't have marital problems!<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I see. You must be yelling at me out of wedded bliss.</p>", "7176": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> (Storming into Howard and Bernadette's room with a baseball bat) Not on my watch!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's fine. It's just Raj. You can hit him with the bat, but it's fine.</p>", "7177": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, we're both down on our luck. Maybe you and I should try to get a place together.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> (chuckles) Okay, listen to me. There is no reason to leave here. This is great. Everyone's nice. It's comfortable. If all goes according to plan, this is my retirement home.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wouldn't you feel better about yourself if you were more independent?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Better than I feel in their steam shower? I don't think so.</p>", "7178": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny would be the entree. Then Leonard's basically a cheese course. And because I love you, you're dessert.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I want to say \"aw,\" but I'm gonna say \"ew.\"</p>", "7179": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> No, you see, I'm doing this so I can stop being spoiled and, you know, grow as a person.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Good for you. This sandwich has six dollars worth of ham in it.</p>", "7180": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> (To Raj) If you ever want to change things up, you're always welcome here.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Just not in our bedroom, you dumbass.</p>", "7181": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, look at that. You've got a Raj, we've got a Stuart. Maybe we should take them both to the park and let them run around together.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. Yours looks like he has worms.</p>", "7182": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I was literally just looking at my moving boxes, trying to pick one to live in.</p>", "7183": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aw, man, did you see this post from Raj?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What? Is it another video of him and his dog Lady-and-the-Tramping some spaghetti?</p>", "7184": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We do have Sheldon's old room. If he really needs a place to stay, I guess we should offer it to him.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're a good friend.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Am I still a good friend if I wait and hope that Howard offers him a place to live first?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're an even better husband.</p>", "7185": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I know if the roles were reversed, he would do it for me.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Where would he stay? We already have Stuart.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, we can make some space in the garage. Maybe put a cot out there, get him a space heater, maybe a hot plate.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That sounds awful.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Let's hope he thinks so, too.</br></p>", "7186": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> For the last time, no Hulk, no Batman, no life-size statues.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wow. I'm starting to think you didn't mean it when you said you wanted to spruce up the place.</p>", "7187": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, so, Howard, what's the bathroom situation gonna be?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, there's a sink out there, so that takes care of half your problems.</p>", "7188": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Why are you asking all these questions?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, to be honest, Leonard's on the other line, and he offered me their spare bedroom.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Great! Go live there.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> But you made the garage sound so fun.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I just didn't want you to feel bad about it. Unless Leonard's apartment also has a raccoon that chews its way in on cold nights, go there!</p>", "7189": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Don't listen to them. What's weird is that Penny almost got a science fact right.</p>", "7190": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I mean, it's unfair. People just assume I'm going to be upset by Raj moving into my old room.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> But you are, aren't you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I'm outraged.</p>", "7191": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Talk to me. Tell me what's going on.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that's been my room since before I met Leonard, and now someone else is going to be living in it. And that someone else is not me. And you know how I feel about people who aren't me.</p>", "7192": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I realize it's irrational, but with Raj moving in there, I'm feeling a bit replaced.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, this isn't an easy time for him. He's losing his apartment, he's in debt, he's probably humiliated.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, probably. But until we know for sure, how can I feel better?</p>", "7193": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You ready to go?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All set.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What's that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A housewarming gift for Raj.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, a bunch of fake snakes better not spring out of it, 'cause that was a lousy anniversary present.</p>", "7194": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Before we eat, I have a little \"welcome to the building\" gift for Raj.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, is anything gonna jump out-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No. I already asked.</p>", "7195": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> This means a lot.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I know this is a difficult time for you. You're losing your apartment, you're in debt, and you just- You must be humiliated.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, good grief. She is such a stickler for citing sources. Those were Amy's words.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know, I know! \"Good grief\" was originally said by Charlie Brown, geez.</p>", "7196": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You're right, I am humiliated. Thanks for pointing it out. You're such a jerk.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can you believe this guy?<br/><strong>Everybody:</strong> Yes!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I thought that was gonna break the other way.</p>", "7197": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> How bad is it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let me put it this way. Do you own a barrel and suspenders?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Are you serious?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not wearing this visor to play women's golf.</p>", "7198": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Dinner's almost ready. If you like meatloaf, I'm sure you'll like its cousin, bowl of meat.</p>", "7199": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So they're both trying to make each other happy, and the end result is they make each other sad? That's hilarious.</p>", "7200": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What is Pink Cheeks?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> It's intimate waxing. Quit looking at that!</br></p>", "7201": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I've been plenty of times. If I miss one, it's fine. I'm a big boy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm a big boy, and if I missed one, I'd throw a big-boy tantrum.</p>", "7202": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Why don't you just tell her not to come?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, she's so excited, I can't do that to her.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What if you make it sound so bad she won't want to go?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That I would do to her.</p>", "7203": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Go ahead, make jokes. I don't know why you think you're going to Comic-Con. You just had a baby.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, so? So you think Bernadette's just gonna let you jet down to San Diego for five days and leave her alone?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hang on. So I have to bring Penny, you can't afford it, Howard's gonna get in trouble, and this guy gets to have a great time.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm gonna go as Dumbledore.</p>", "7204": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday, and I was hoping I could go with the guys. But before you say anything, I'll make up for being gone by doing everything around here. I mean everything. I'm even gonna answer for you. (Imitating Bernadette's voice) Yes, Howard, you can go.</p>", "7205": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> This is us camping out in line for the Avengers panel.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, you really sleep on the sidewalk, huh?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. It can get chilly, but Raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag, it helps keep you warm.</p>", "7206": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't worry, we won't be doing much sleeping anyway. It's like an all-night party. There's trivia contests and Dungeons &amp; Dragons. As we like to say, it's \"off the chain mail.\"</p>", "7207": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, maybe it won't be that bad. Leonard says it's really mainstream now. Comic books aren't just for sad nerds anymore. (Penny drives past Raj, dressed as Aquaman, twirling a sign for Stuart's comic book store) I mean, it is still a key part of their demographic.</p>", "7208": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm always honest with Amy. The other day she said she was self-conscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder, and I said, \"You know, you can call that a beauty mark all you want. When there's hair growing out of it, that's a mole.\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you think she's as honest with you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I should hope so. When she called me an insensitive jerk, I'd like to think she meant it.</p>", "7209": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> There's got to be other ways you can make a quick buck.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, you'd think. (Bernadette enters with shopping) Ooh, maybe I could sell my blood and sperm.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I really should wear a bell around my neck so you guys can hear me coming.</p>", "7210": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Penny says they're ready to go. Very well.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Prepare for a long night of deceit.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, women can wear makeup, it's not lying.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was talking about Leonard. And if makeup is so truthful, why is it called \"concealer\"?</p>", "7211": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't wait to tell them.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, you're not gonna tell them anything. You're gonna stay out of it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Because it's between them.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, if you haven't noticed, I've been between them for the last ten years.</p>", "7212": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> As much as I appreciate this, I can't accept it. Okay? Halley's my goddaughter, I don't take care of her for money.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I would.</p>", "7213": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Keep it. Consider it a gift.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hold on. Is it back pay or is it a gift?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What's the difference?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When the IRS questions us in separate rooms, we need to have our stories straight.</p>", "7214": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know what? I've gone 12 times. Maybe I'll sit out this year, too.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. Maybe you and I can do something fun that weekend.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, how about white-water rafting?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, how about we compromise and go on the Small World ride at Disneyland?</p>", "7215": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> We're betting to see if Koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Its weight and smoothness, along with the slight concavity of the mirror, means it can spin for a long time.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But Raj is from India, which means he's no slouch at holding his breath.</br></p>", "7216": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, I want in. Ten bucks says I'll lose interest before that thing stops spinning.</p>", "7217": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, Sheldon, I found a great restaurant for date night.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Kind of busy right now.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, an Euler's Disk! Fun!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, we're seeing if Raj can hold his breath longer than it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh. Immature.</p>", "7218": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> (To Raj) Dig deep! Like when we bet you couldn't fit into Howard's pants!</p>", "7219": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, Daddy, you're so rich and funny.</p>", "7220": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> So what else is going on with your life?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, well, I was dating a woman at the university, but we broke up.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> I'm sorry to hear that.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I know you are. That's why you just bought me a new iPad.</p>", "7221": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I can't believe what I'm hearing. This is deeply hurtful.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> You're also too sensitive. Women don't want that either.</p>", "7222": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> The food here's supposed to be great. Don't fill up on chips.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I won't. I have a trick. I only eat equilateral triangles. Isosceles, isosceles, oh, scalene (breaks the corner off a chip and eats it) - You didn't see that.</p>", "7223": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It turns out he doesn't care if I'm married or if I'm single. He's basically given up on me.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, I'm sure that's not true.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It is. He stopped trying to find Indian girls for me to marry.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> All you did was complain when he did that.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard, he's hurting. Let him feel how he feels.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you, Penny.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. Shoes, I'm a seven-and-a-half; boots, I'm an eight.</p>", "7224": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, how much exactly does he pay for?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, I'll tell you, but please don't judge me. He pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm trying, but I'm judging.</p>", "7225": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know about that?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Were you aware of this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj, Kripke, uh, Professor Wu, Professor Klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria. How everyone else found out is a mystery to me.</p>", "7226": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right. Hang on. We can figure this out. Let's just go over your expenses. How much is your rent?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't want to say.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Is it really that high?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't want to say because I don't know how much it is.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You don't how much your rent is?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> My father pays for it! Do you know how much your rent is?!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, then double it, because my building's a lot nicer than this dump.</p>", "7227": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you know how much your car costs?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Not really.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, how much do you spend on food?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> The housekeeper does the shopping.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, my God, you really are spoiled.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm spoiled?! Your baby has a cape that costs $300!</p>", "7228": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Well, I really envy your relationship. Other than you two only having sex once a year, you're the perfect couple.</p>", "7229": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Actually, we met online. Our first date was at a coffee shop.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up. Oh, he looks sad again.</p>", "7230": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you really worried about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I was just excited to list him as a friend.</br></p>", "7231": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I do appreciate you working on this. I'm sorry you were embarrassed.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And now I understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, Dr. Fink.</p>", "7232": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> We need to talk.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> All right.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I have come to an important decision. I will not be accepting your money any more. I'm a man, and I can take care of myself.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> That's wonderful!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes, that is wonderful! You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled!<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> I am so proud of you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Dad, I'm trying to tell you off, and you're ruining it with your delight and relief.</p>", "7233": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> We should go say hi.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Because that's what you do when you see someone you know in a public place.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, there's a difference between greeting a friend and following a celebrity into a bathroom.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If the judge couldn't explain it to me, I don't see how you will.</p>", "7234": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me. May I have your attention, please? I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip. And I just want to say, shame on all of you. We're scientists. Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge, not the intimate details of other people's lives.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> He's right. And I'm sorry for the part I played in this.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you, Bert. You're a good man. That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> That doesn't paint me in the best light.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh. Oh, I'm sorry. Correction: That woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert, she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done. That better?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Not really.</p>", "7235": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, well, to sum up: Focus on science, keep your nose out of other people's business, and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call Bert.</p>", "7236": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What brought that on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (sighs) Well, last night Amy was angry with me because I'd been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's understandable.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I know that now. At first, I thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps. It turns out, no, she was genuinely mortified.</p>", "7237": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, we don't need to make this smaller. Your work is done. Go home.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't want to go home.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Then go for a little walk.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Then what?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just keep walking.</p>", "7238": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> At least it's quiet when he takes bathroom breaks.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I know. That's why I keep refilling his water when he's not looking.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're kidding.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't care if we're in a drought, it's worth it.</p>", "7239": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I can't believe you have to fill out a preschool application for an infant.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, the one at Caltech has a crazy wait list. I warned you, a lot of people apply when they're still pregnant.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, I didn't. I also skipped a birthing class to see Zootopia, so back off.</p>", "7240": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Seriously, let's plan a night, you know, give you a break. We could go dancing.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That sounds really nice.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh. All this week, the Early Music Society of Pasadena is doing a joint concert with the San Gabriel Renaissance Choir.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, that's the one to beat.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Good luck. People have been saying that for 600 years.</p>", "7241": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And guess where we get to sleep? Our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose. Now, the problem with a caboose is there's no bathroom, but the problem with the bunkhouse is it's not a caboose.</p>", "7242": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> On the first day, I get to drive a steam engine. Oh, and the second day, a diesel engine. Oh, and if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork, they'll let me stay as long as I want. So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Can I pee now?</p>", "7243": "<p><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Just wanted to see how the guidance system's coming along.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Great. We found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> As a cooling solution, it's pretty cool.<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Don't do that.</p>", "7244": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sir, uh, if I may, uh, we've put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype. It's a really elegant solution, and most importantly, it works.<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Yeah, I want this.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But that's just a theory. It's not even a complete thought.<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> You both make excellent points. And thank you for presenting it so articulately. Make this.</p>", "7245": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Like I said, you ladies have fun.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We will. Got my dancing shoes, got my breast pump. Let's party.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, if you pump at the bar, I promise we'll get free drinks.</br></p>", "7246": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Call if there's any problems.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No. She's busy. You call Howard.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Got it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Call me. Don't call Howard.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I would never call Howard.</p>", "7247": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I can't believe we have to ask Sheldon to come back and help us.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, boo-hoo. I spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon.</p>", "7248": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I would love to help you, but since I discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine, I don't think I can go back to theory. I'm an engineer now. And, hey, just to be clear, a train engineer. Not that goofy kind you are.</p>", "7249": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, you can still go on the trip in a few weeks. Just help us out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sorry. I need to work on this engine so when I get to the train yard I won't look foolish.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (laughs) He's worried about looking foolish. That's a heapin' helping of irony right there.</p>", "7250": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay. This is everything he had on the board. I'm sure we can figure the rest out.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> All right. (clears throat) Hmm. Feel free to jump in. \"Hmm\" is all I got.</p>", "7251": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We can get this. Is there any chance it's upside-down?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's classified. If we tell anyone, we'd get in trouble.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, I came up with that and \"hmm.\" You haven't pitched anything.</p>", "7252": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Nothing to worry about. She's just been crying for a little while, and I was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> She was sleeping just fine till you took a selfie with her!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> She was blowing a spit bubble. It was adorable!</p>", "7253": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, there's another dance club nearby. I mean, I don't know how you feel about Latin music, but according to their \"horas of operacion\", they're open.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Maybe we should just call it a night.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You sure? They're open till dos.</p>", "7254": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You think that stuff is fun? Being a parent is terrifying. I'm constantly worried, I'm always tired, and in a few minutes, I'm gonna milk myself in a bookstore parking lot.</p>", "7255": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> It's just, Leonard and I have been married for two years, and we're no further along than when we were dating.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Come on. You've got so much to feel good about. You've got a great job now.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I guess I am making decent money.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You make more than I do.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You may not have a house yet, but your apartment's great.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's bigger than mine.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> And Leonard loves you so much, he married you twice.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm not even engaged once. I don't even know if Sheldon thinks about marriage. I'm not getting any younger. Honestly, I kind of thought by now, we might have had some sort of-<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong>  Careful. The sound of crying can make me lactate.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm sorry. I can't help it. (crying)<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's gonna make me cry. (crying)<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> And there they go.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ew.</p>", "7256": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, Sheldon. You can't turn your back on physics. Besides, you have no idea what you're doing with this stuff.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But if you really want to learn the mechanical side, I can teach you anything you want to know.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And instead of standing around watching, you can help us build your smaller guidance system.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And with all these new skills, you'd be able to fix any model train. You'd be the king of the train store!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me. I have a girlfriend. I'm already king of the train store.</p>", "7257": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You guys ready to get crazy?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, the bra under here ain't beige.</p>", "7258": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, what did you do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We were discussing Raj's recent breakup and apparently, I was insensitive to him.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's okay, I'm fine.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You d- Don't fall for it. He'll get you to compare him to a dead virgin, and suddenly you're the bad guy.</p>", "7259": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wonderful. Although I'm not sure how I feel about being used as a guinea pig.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, when you get the machine, you can find out.</p>", "7260": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, great news. The TV I want will fit in the gaming room, and if I leave the curtains open, I can watch it from work.</p>", "7261": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, I'm looking at the first picture.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You are happy?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes. I'm looking at puppies.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aw. Somebody's ignoring their tiny needle teeth, but all right.</br></p>", "7262": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm not saying you have to ask my permission, but you could have talked to me about it before you said it was okay.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Like you talked to me about your gaming room?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Our gaming room! I was gonna put a scented candle in it.</p>", "7263": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Stay out of this. You and your stupid machine started this fight!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (gasps) You are lucky that this feelings machine doesn't have feelings.</p>", "7264": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So did all of you go on to better relationships after me?<br/><strong>Lucy:</strong> Oh, yeah.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Without question.<br/><strong>Claire:</strong> Little before, actually.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (Interpreting for Emily) Oh, wow. Don't let him get away.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wait. What did she say?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Uh, basically, she traded you for Bruce Wayne.</p>", "7265": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, guys, it sounds like you're getting angry again.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's because we are.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes! I don't need an emotion machine! I am one!</p>", "7266": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, if you want to march in a fishnet crop top, you better lay off that dip.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> If you didn't want me to eat it, why'd you put it out?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It was for the girls. They broke up with me. I don't care if they get fat.</p>", "7267": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, is that any way to talk to your future husband?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, I was being hypothetical, okay? I would never marry you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Please. When you see the ring I pick out, you're gonna melt.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, right. Wait, is it rose gold? Actually, don't tell me. I want to be surprised.</p>", "7268": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, did you wind up sending that machine back?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I did. You know, I'm not even sure how accurate it was. I took it to the train store, it said everyone was sad.</p>", "7269": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, uh, Bernadette, let's test this theory. What do you think I'm feeling right now?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Let's see. You're better than us, a little bit sorry for us, but mostly glad you don't have to be us.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (To Howard) Keep filling this one with babies. She's good.</p>", "7270": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, how is this any different from you making me live with Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey! I shared my Honey Nut Cheerios with you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You gave me a bill at the end of every month.</p>", "7271": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, do you remember when we went wine tasting in Santa Barbara and you said that was the best rose you'd ever had?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I remember us driving up there, going to the winery and that's it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And this wine is why.</p>", "7272": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, now be careful, these are hot. I could explain the thermodynamics of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust, but instead, I'm gonna keep it to myself.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. You always know what not to say.</p>", "7273": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> If you must know, Penny won a spa weekend from work and she's taking me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, well you know, that is interesting. I wonder what kind of infection you'll come home with. My money's on fungal.</p>", "7274": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Penny, is it weird that we're having girls' night here, but you don't live here anymore, so it's basically my girls' night?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I hadn't really thought about it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> But now you're thinking about it and it bothers you? I get that.</p>", "7275": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Just, it's like since we got married, he doesn't really try anymore.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Uh, Penny? I don't know how to say this, but this is my first girls' night and you're kind of bumming everybody out.</br></p>", "7276": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Penny, I'm trying to take an interest in other people. Uh, how was your girls' night?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, it was fine.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did you have anything to eat?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, chips.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (stammers) Anything to drink?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Some wine.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I'm just playing tennis against the drapes here.</p>", "7277": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where is this coming from?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, she might be drunk. All she had was chips.</p>", "7278": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'll miss you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll miss you, too.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'll miss you more.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, if X equals the amount that you'll miss me, then I'll miss you X plus one.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (giggles) If you miss me X plus one, I'll miss you open parentheses X plus one, close parentheses to the second-</p>", "7279": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, what can we do to cheer you up?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I really don't know.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You want to play Jenga? Or, uh, Ticket to Ride? Hearthstone? What would you be the happiest losing at?</p>", "7280": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would you like to play a driving game I invented?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is it about the failing state of my relationship with Penny?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Never mind.</p>", "7281": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, Penny went to this spa to be away from you. Are you sure you should be going there?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't want to wait two days for us to work this out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Very well. You got married spur of the moment. I don't see why your divorce should be any different.</p>", "7282": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Watch. It's easy, once you get the hang of it. Step. Step. Hop onto ottoman.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Don't do that in socks, I almost broke my neck.</p>", "7283": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Then simply sit, spin, stand, stretch. Maybe in looser pants. Then step, grab, tiny pivot, pull, and you're there. (sighs) Easy, peasy, mac and (exhales) ... you get the idea.</p>", "7284": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh! Good, you're here. Are you still fighting? If you get divorced, do I get two Christmases?</p>", "7285": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So tell me, how did Sheldon look with an earring?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the Internet.</p>", "7286": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So what did you and Leonard do?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Actually, we got in a pretty nasty fight.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It might've been the worst one we've ever had.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, my God, what happened?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, we had started binge-watching Luke Cage together, and it was kind of our thing, and then, I find out that she watched two episodes without me.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's like I was excited for a present and got socks.</p>", "7287": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, hey, I just found a farm where they let you chop down your own tree.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh cool, I'll be like a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan.</p>", "7288": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You want to decorate it tonight?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, with gasoline and a match? Sure.</p>", "7289": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, in India when my baby brother cried like that, the servants would just take him far away so we couldn't hear it. (Howard and Bernadette stare at him) Not always, sometimes we'd leave.</p>", "7290": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, so how does the story end? Is the baby a jerk or is Bernadette a bad mother?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What? Is there another twist coming? Is the baby not theirs at all?</br></p>", "7291": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So things started to turn around?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, eventually I figured out how to get the baby to sleep.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Please tell me you didn't use Amy's magic juice.</p>", "7292": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I can't believe you fit in the crib.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I could take a bath in the sink. I don't, but I can.</p>", "7293": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, can you help me put some of the food out?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. Let me finish packing this stuff up. You know how Sheldon is if he sees Christmas stuff lying around after New Year's.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, but he doesn't live here anymore.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, he doesn't live at Walmart, but he still threw a tantrum when he saw Marshmallow Peeps after Easter. And that's the same man who complains you can't find Marshmallow Peeps after Easter.</p>", "7294": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, what happened in Texas that was so bad?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And before our next drive to Comic-Con, I need the name of that juice.</p>", "7295": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How did you get him in the car?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I rented one of those carts, pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest.</p>", "7296": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> But understanding how other people are feeling, that's a weak spot for you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have gotten much better at that.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Have you? How am I feeling right now?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What the - How should I know? Excited? Itchy? Give me the first letter.</p>", "7297": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You and I are in a relationship. I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> \"Delighted\"? What - Not if I guessed for a hundred years.</p>", "7298": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> (In a sing-songy fashion) You see, I was at the doctor's office, the folder was right there, so I took a peek.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (Imitating Koothrappali) And talking like this doesn't make it less creepy.</p>", "7299": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Damn, I need my inhaler.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Just don't smoke.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I went down the stairs too fast.</p>", "7300": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I found it, but it's empty.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, it doesn't matter. We're not going to the hospital now.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you sure? I'd really like to.</p>", "7301": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> If we find my backup inhaler, maybe we can get frisky.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, you sexy, wheezy little man.</p>", "7302": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Raj!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (into the camera) Well, okay, I'm gonna sign off now. This next part may contain some adult language.</p>", "7303": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Found the backup inhaler. Want to have sex?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I didn't until I heard that.</p>", "7304": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> (Outside, in a sing-song voice) Hello! Howard and Bernadette kicked me out because I told them they're having a girl! Oopsy, I did it again.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Maybe if we're quiet, he'll go away.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (sing-songy) You're gonna have to be quieter than that.</p>", "7305": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I got a Gryffindor robe for you.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (exhales) Oh A Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff? How scandalous.</br></p>", "7306": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> (hiding behind the door in her Harry Potter costume) Hello Is this about the baby?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No. People just keep kicking me out everywhere I go.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Good. Then you're used to this. (closes the door on Raj)</p>", "7307": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So, what are we gonna name this kid? Now that we know she's a girl, it kind of ruins my plan for Wally Wolowitz.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Could name her after your mom.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Debbie? (chuckles) No, she hated that name.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Did she have a middle name?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Melvina.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Let's keep thinking.</p>", "7308": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I've come to peace with my relationship with my parents. That was a big milestone for me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, speaking of personal growth, I recently tried eating Swiss chard. You know, I didn't swallow it, but Amy said it counted.</p>", "7309": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, Raj, honey, you're being too hard on yourself. When I first met you, you couldn't even talk to women. I mean, you couldn't even talk if one was in the room.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, great, now I can say things like \"I can't believe you're breaking up with me.\", \"Why are you breaking up with me?\", \"Yes, I'll still help you move\".</p>", "7310": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, now, what about our 3-D chess set?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Let me guess, you want it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, no, I just didn't think you'd want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win. As a kindness, I should probably take all the games.</p>", "7311": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I've got the Neosporin. Who got hurt?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's a good thing you're cute.</p>", "7312": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong>  It's like we have a butler. If I had a Batsuit I'd be Bruce Wayne.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You have a Batsuit.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's pajamas, there's no cape.</p>", "7313": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's hooks in the closet, I can hang it right now.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, no, no, those hooks are gone.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What happened to them?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, we ran out of candy on Halloween, I was just giving everything away.</p>", "7314": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> When would you move in?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, uh, my car broke down in your driveway, so I'm gonna say now.</p>", "7315": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, Leonard, you know, who should keep this? On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock more than you do. On the other hand, I care more about clocks than you do.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So you think you should keep it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll be right across the hall. You'll probably be able to hear it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Keep the clock, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Thank you?</p>", "7316": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know what, Sheldon, take it. In fact, you can have everything. I really don't care.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you sure? These items represent our shared times together.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, now they're yours.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, you know what's gonna happen. He's just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For a man so good at predicting my moves, how come you stink at 3-D chess?</p>", "7317": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> No, I needed a place to stay and, with the baby coming, I figured they could use some extra help.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, cool.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Anyway, come on in, dinner's ready.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, but I bought Chinese takeout.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, okay.Well, if Bernadette wants her ankles to swell up even more, she can have that.</p>", "7318": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is the Wi-Fi working for you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, hang on. I don't think so, I'm clicking on \"One weird trick for a flat belly,\" but I'm still seeing \"Celebrities who look like their pets\".</p>", "7319": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I knew it, Sheldon changed the password.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you sure?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, the new network name is, \"Ha ha ha, now I've got you,\" so It's either Sheldon or Gargamel from The Smurfs.</p>", "7320": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, I was reading how it's a good idea for new parents to take an infant CPR class.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, we've been meaning to do that.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, I know a CPR instructor who'll come to the house.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That'd be great.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'll give him a call. We met when I was sleeping on the beach and he thought I was dead.</br></p>", "7321": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I believe that is flag to crotch four, checkmate. Easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy.</p>", "7322": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Why can't there be four wheels?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Is this what you do when I'm not here, make really good points?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Look, just come in and help me build a baby swing.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> If you're hungry you can eat your takeout; nobody touched it.</p>", "7323": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I think I'm gonna go for a run. You want to come?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming, \"Watch out, he's right behind you.\"</p>", "7324": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, there are fresh linens on the bed and - Oh. Well, now, I see you've met Theodore. Theodore, these are your new roommates, Leonard and Penny. They're very honest, but I would not leave cash lying around.</p>", "7325": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, Sheldon, this is over the line.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's true, but had I done something under the line, there wouldn't be a man in your kitchen who can't produce a single form of ID.<br/><strong>Theodore:</strong> Oh, oh, I have a receipt from a blood bank. I'm O-negative.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And now you know as much about him as I do.</p>", "7326": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, could you please go to the market for me?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Get Stuart or Raj to do it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie, they've been doing everything for you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Mm, I know. It's really making me lose respect for both of them.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Please just go to the store.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine. (shouting) Who wants to drive me to the store?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (off-screen) Me!<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> (off-screen) I'll do it!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Take Raj. Stuart is supposed to paint my toenails.</p>", "7327": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, Theodore, how long are you planning to stay exactly?<br/><strong>Theodore:</strong> Oh, thanks to the coins I found in your couch, a day longer than I thought.</p>", "7328": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, get out here!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Will you keep it down? What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think I'm running?</p>", "7329": "<p><strong>Theodore:</strong> Excuse me. It's none of my business, but it sounds like a lot of this anger is coming from love.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, thanks, but nobody asked you.<br/><strong>Theodore:</strong> Well, I'm just gonna keep on talking. Seems like, with Sheldon moving out, you're in a new phase of your lives and it's easier to fight than to face the feelings that you have for one another.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I think he might be right. Also, who is that?</p>", "7330": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have to admit, leaving you to move in with Amy has been harder than I thought it would be.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, for me, too. It's not the same with you gone.<br/>\nTheodore: If you're looking for a new guy to live with-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We're good. Thank you.</p>", "7331": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, it's not even called the \"Genius Grant,\" it's the MacArthur Fellowship. Just like it's not Frankenstein, it's \"Frankenstein's Monster.\" Which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there. And if anyone's a genius, it's me for the way I brought that full circle.</p>", "7332": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You busy? There's somebody out here who wants to meet you.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Who is it?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Say hello to everybody's little friend, remote control Stephen Hawking!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Where did you get that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I found him in an old box.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why would you buy it?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I didn't buy it. I made it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Last question. What is wrong with you?</p>", "7333": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's always fun watching him read someone else's work.<br/>\n*Sheldon grimaces as he's reading Bert's paper*<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's like scrolling through the emojis on my phone.</p>", "7334": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, it's foolish to be angry that Bert's work has merit.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, well I am angry! And you telling me not to be angry makes me angry! And do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (raises her hand) Ooh, angry?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I knew the answer. I got excited.</p>", "7335": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, buddy, why don't we go for a walk, so you can calm down.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's a good idea. I guess everyone's having them now.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, I'm trying to help you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. You can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (To the girls) You just wave your arms a little and they fly away, it's not--</br></p>", "7336": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, Raj, I'm gonna show you something. Now, one of us thinks it's offensive. The other thinks it's hilarious and a great idea. But, I'm not going to tell you who likes it.<br/>\n(Howard demonstrates Remote Control Stephen Hawking)<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> This is tough. But I'm going to say it's the guy who shows me YouTube videos of people getting hit in the nuts.</p>", "7337": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, I'm having a primal urge to throw this rock.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do it. Visualize it as your anger and toss it out of your life.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perhaps I will. This rock encapsulates all my negative emotions. I will cast you far away. Feel free to take out a pigeon while you're at it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Let it fly.</p>", "7338": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, Sheldon, instead of fixating on what Bert has, you should appreciate all of the good things in your life. You've got love, you're in good health, you've got a roof over your head.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, but you've got all those things, and no one's lining up to be you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Anybody else want to try? I'm gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices.</p>", "7339": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> This is getting old fast, Dolores, knock it off!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, do you really think calling me names is helpful?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I do! Your life is fine, you big baby!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Maybe you're right.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really?!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If it helps, I'm questioning your life choices, too.</p>", "7340": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What's up?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm conducting a quick survey. Do you think this respectful and loving tribute to a great man is in poor taste? (Howard rolls out Remote Control Stephen Hawking)<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yep.</p>", "7341": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I've worked with Hawking. He's got a great sense of humor. And I think he'd like it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay, call him and show him. I dare you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I have no problem calling him.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Fine, then do it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine, I will.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> While you're bothering the world's most famous scientist, be sure to show him how funny he looks getting stuck under our dishwasher.</p>", "7342": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Do you think this is in poor taste?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Does it spin around and do tricks?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Then yeah.</p>", "7343": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I can't believe you head-butted a water fountain.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I went to punch the water fountain, slipped in water in front of the water fountain, and hit my head on the water fountain.</p>", "7344": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Ever since I met Penny, I've been envious of her looks.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aw, thank you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's why I was so happy when you cut your hair off.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What?!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You know what I mean. You were still hot, but more like a \"why'd that hot girl cut off all her hair?\" hot.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You liked my short hair, right?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (unconvincingly) Yeah I loved it. Love you, love the hair, would love to change the subject.</p>", "7345": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Seriously, none of you liked it?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I thought it was brave. Does that count as liking it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, how come nobody's talking about Howard's dopey haircut?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I think he looks cute.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And I think you're cute.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I think you're both cute.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I think I hate all of you nerds.</p>", "7346": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sorry I'm moving slowly.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I don't mind. If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket, it would be like I'm walking with my grandma.</p>", "7347": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A plaque? Nobody wants to see this.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, change \"plaque\" to \"mixed-race couple\" and you are my grandma.</p>", "7348": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, I'd somehow be unburdened.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Is it working?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. Now that you know my weakness, I hate you more than ever.</p>", "7349": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Sheldon wait. You know, you've got a lot to be happy about. You're at the top of your field, you have a great girlfriend.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes! That's right! I have Amy! In the past, you've professed feelings for her. Does it eat you up inside that I have her and you don't?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> It used to. But now that I'm rich and successful, I think I can do better.</p>", "7350": "<p><strong>Issabella:</strong> You know, I have to say, based on the candy wrappers and the bags of junk food I see in this trash, I thought the person working here was ten years old.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, please, show me a ten-year-old who knows to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella.</br></p>", "7351": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, Sheldon I see astrocytes. Our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have such a profound sense of creation. I jus- It's like when I hatched Sea-Monkeys, except that this is from my DNA, so this is like Me-Monkeys.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> These cells come from both of us.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, but Us-Monkeys doesn't pop. Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait! We-Monkeys. There you go.</p>", "7352": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> No, she's right. As long as I've known you, you've always been self-conscious about your cleavage.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's because you keep trying to stick pencils in it.</p>", "7353": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, enough about us, how are things going with you?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Great, the doctor said the baby's head is facing down now.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Good, you know, in case the exit isn't clearly marked.</p>", "7354": "<p><strong>Issabella:</strong> Good night, Rajesh.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, I'll leave. But just know, every time I come in here, I'll be thinking of you.</p>", "7355": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, where are you going? Did you even look at my bottom?</p>", "7356": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> We're in the telescope room! It'll be like dining under the stars. You see this, uh, double zero? When it says \"01\" that means it's twinkling. ... Sometimes it takes a while.</p>", "7357": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I tried to cook you a meal from your homeland.<br/><strong>Issabella:</strong> Oh, really? You made Cuban food?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That depends. Do they have Mexican food in Cuba?</p>", "7358": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Now, when he said \"make a baby\" is it possible he meant out of Legos?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No. He was explicit. Needlessly and freakishly explicit.</p>", "7359": "<p>(Amy, Leonard and Penny reach the fourth floor and discover Sheldon has laid out rose petals leading to the door of Apartment 4B)<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Aww, man!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh! Sheldon gonna get some.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, have fun with whatever nightmare's behind door number two.</p>", "7360": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, um, what surprised you the most when you first came to America?<br/><strong>Issabella:</strong> Well, I suppose how much people care about Oprah's favorite things.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I thought that, too. But then I got my first waffle maker and never questioned her again.</p>", "7361": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Issabella! Issabella, wait, wait, let me explain.<br/><strong>Issabella:</strong> If you are embarrassed by what I do, why did you pursue me?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm sorry. Honestly, I didn't think your job would bother me, but I guess it did. And I hate myself for that. But there's a lot of things about me that would totally embarrass you.<br/><strong>Issabella:</strong> I doubt that.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, prepare to be mortified. I let my dog eat food out of my mouth, not because she likes it but because I do. Also, I know they're pretty, but I'm scared of butterflies.</p>", "7362": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would you care for a brandy?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't think so.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good choice. It's disgusting.</p>", "7363": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hit it.<br/>\n*Howard playing keyboards and Raj playing guitar*<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (Singing) For joy and fun, there's no better manner, than to fly a pennant, flag or banner<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What fills my heart, and makes my eyes moist, sending a flag, up a pole on a hoist.<br/><strong>Raj &amp; Howard:</strong> Fun with Flags, Fun with Flags<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh! Say can you see.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's Fun with Flags.<br/><strong>Raj &amp; Howard:</strong> Fun with Flags.</p>", "7364": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> As you may notice, just one of the changes around here is our new house band.<br/>\n*Howard plays a keyboard solo*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who haven't learned their place yet.</p>", "7365": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, they finished the work early, but she's been telling Sheldon they're behind schedule.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, she's just been lying to him?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, you've lied to Sheldon.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, but to make him leave, not to make him stay.</br></p>", "7366": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Buda and Pest united to form Budapest. And that's why Budapest is the \"Budabest\".</p>", "7367": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, uh, what about dinner?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is it me or are you purposely changing the subject?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No. And on the subject of subjects, is your use of the word \"subject\" the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have a feeling you're still doing it. But I find that topic irresistible, so, now, in ancient Mesopotamia, the king referred to the people as his property.</p>", "7368": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> See, I've known that for weeks, but, you know, I waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain.</p>", "7369": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Superman's gone. My stormtrooper's gone.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Your Klingon word-of-the-day calendar's gone.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'd say \"damn it\" in Klingon, but that wasn't until next month.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's \"khoo-vakh\".<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Khoo-vakh!</p>", "7370": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> And what's it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband's stuff?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wha-That is not true!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Bernadette told Howard, Howard told me. Plus, I can see all my stuff is gone!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friend's wife and your own eyes over me? Wow.</p>", "7371": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You really didn't think I'd notice my stuff was missing?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, did you notice your key chain?<br/>\n*Leonard goes to the door and checks his keys*<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where's Batman?!</p>", "7372": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm not really a part of this, so I'm just gonna dig in.</p>", "7373": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Now that everything's out on the table, you think you two will keep living together?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Despite recent events, I do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you saying you'd like to live with me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm open to the possibility.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (gasps)<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Amy, b-be, b-cool.</p>", "7374": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If we did continue living together, would it be here?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't know. It could be.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course there's there's always your apartment.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sure, sure, we could live in my apartment.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I hate your apartment.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sorry, you brought it up?</p>", "7375": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> This isn't complicated. Do you love Amy?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Do you like living with her?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you know what you need to do now?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Apparently, figure this out on my own 'cause you guys are no help at all.</p>", "7376": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm just contemplating Buridan's donkey.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I understand. I'll leave you be.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What, you're familiar with the reference?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Of course. Jean Buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralyzed by indecision and would starve to death.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Exactly.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I wouldn't want you to starve to death, so here's an eggplant.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, some people believe that Buridan was plagiarizing Aristotle.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Although, in Aristotle's example, he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Huh. Yeah, I wonder if that's related to the 12th century Persian philosopher, Al-Ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali was Aristotelian? 'Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian? Boy, you think you know a guy.</p>", "7377": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just hiding some stuff in your closet, don't tell Penny.</p>", "7378": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> I once left orange juice in my fridge so long, it tasted like a mimosa.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> How old was it?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> It's hard to say. I don't remember much after I drank it.</p>", "7379": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?<br/><strong>Mrs. Petrescu:</strong> Yes. Drink is fun and good friends - Applebee's.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She's learning English from TV.<br/><strong>Mrs. Petrescu:</strong> TV, good. Now back to you.</p>", "7380": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> So, what did I miss?<br><strong>Bert:</strong> Eh, we watched Sheldon try to open a bottle for 15 minutes.<br/><strong>Mrs. Petrescu:</strong> 15 minutes can save you 15% or more on car insurance.</br></p>", "7381": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What's your name?<br/><strong>Jeff:</strong> Jeff.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Jeff:</strong> My favorite part is your shower scene.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Been hearing that a lot today.<br/><strong>Jeff:</strong> I even have a screen grab on my phone.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yep, there they are.</p>", "7382": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Should've punched that guy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, go ahead. He's right over there.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why do you do that? Can't you let me have my moment?</p>", "7383": "<p><strong>Guy:</strong> Hi. I like your movies.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thank you!<br/><strong>Guy:</strong> I saw both of them.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I assume we're still talking about the movies, but after today, who knows.</p>", "7384": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, show her the trunk! Show her the trunk!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Imagine this: you've got the baby in one hand, groceries in the other, and you're thinking, \"How am I gonna open this trunk?\"<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm probably thinking, \"Where's my husband, and why isn't he helping me?\"<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You don't need my help when you can open the trunk with a simple kick of the foot.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, it's a gentle kick; you're doing it wrong.</p>", "7385": "<p><strong>Mrs. Petrescu:</strong> My sister's husband took all her things, too. Story at 11:00.</p>", "7386": "<p><strong>Guy:</strong> But how did you get her to go out with you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, she moved in across the hall.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And he started to slowly wear me down.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mm-hmm. Like a river carves a canyon.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, except the river kept showing me his Pokemon cards.</p>", "7387": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> If childbirth is half this bad, you are so screwed!</p>", "7388": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, in fact, I'd like to propose a toast. To Stuart. A fine man, a good friend and a wonderful guest.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Hear, hear.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Cheers.<br/><strong>Mrs. Petrescu:</strong> Cheers. Filmed before a live studio audience.</p>", "7389": "<p><strong>Guy:</strong> I didn't know you can propose to the same person so many times.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The third time, I did it in skywriting, but she never looked up.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, once, I proposed to him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. I said no.<br/><strong>Guy #2:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I just wanted to make her work for it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, that's gonna cost you later.</p>", "7390": "<p><strong>Guy #2:</strong> Is she just with you because you're rich?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She makes more money than I do!</p>", "7391": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> There's a baby in there.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, yeah, that's where I put it.</p>", "7392": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wow! An appearance by George Lucas's ... dermatologist. Oh, I want that autograph.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, yeah.</p>", "7393": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard, it's sweet you're excited about this, but it'll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you kidding? I once paid $20 for Theo Sassler's signature.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Who's that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I don't even know. I just liked his name. Theo Sassler!</p>", "7394": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, and look at this. I even got a change maker. How much change you want, little lady?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, there's so much I want to change.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, well, if it's a dollar, you're in luck.</p>", "7395": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sounds expensive.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, well, I may have gone a bit overboard, but you can't put a price on safety.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Though if you did, it's more zeroes than you're expecting.</br></p>", "7396": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Never been on this side of the table before. I feel powerful.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? I feel like I'm selling candy so our team can get new uniforms.</p>", "7397": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, look who's in favor of compromise, the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, she didn't compromise. She settled. There's a difference.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, you tell him, babe.</p>", "7398": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, pulling a quarter out of your ear isn't the only magic these hands can do. In fact, what's this between your toes?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Can you please stop making money come out of me for two minutes?</p>", "7399": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, I'm confused. Which one is Mr. Robot?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'll give you a hint. We're watching Daredevil.</p>", "7400": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Will you two please inform Amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Can't.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Won't.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Didn't.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't.</p>", "7401": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You wanna see other people? Go see other people.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I hope one of those people is a monkey, 'cause this is bananas.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, you can make jokes, but if this keeps up, he's gonna move back in here.</p>", "7402": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Who's ready for a hot, three-hour car ride to the desert?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Next vomit is gonna be in your lap.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm sorry. We don't have to go.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> But it's our last chance to take a vacation that's just the two of us.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> How 'bout we stay here? We don't even have to tell anyone. It'll be like a secret vacation at home.</p>", "7403": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Keeping secrets from our friends. That does sound kinda fun.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Does it sound sexy?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You just heard me throwing up.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You bet I did.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're so weird.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know what's weird? How turned on you are right now.</p>", "7404": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Is that the hot tub?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Who would use our hot tub?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Who is it?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Stuart.</p>", "7405": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Is it me, or is there something fun about watching him just float there?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe this is why people get fish tanks.</p>", "7406": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What are you doing here?!<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> What are you doing here?!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Maybe Howard and Bernadette said I could be here!<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Did they?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Answer the question! What are you doing here?!</p>", "7407": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, one night, Leonard's nose whistled so loud, I swear it was like sleeping on a train track.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Have you noticed it's always an A-flat?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Is it?<br/>\n*Sheldon whistles*<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh! It's like his sinuses are right here in the car.</p>", "7408": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If we're just going to drive around aimlessly, the least you could do is take me for ice cream.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I'll take you for ice cream.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, see, why can't Amy be that subservient? She has coitus one time, suddenly she's Gloria Steinem.</p>", "7409": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So how's your apartment?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Not great. The electricity's out.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> So why don't you get it fixed?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I called, and they're like, \"Pay your bill!\"</p>", "7410": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why wouldn't he tell us? Are we bad friends?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> He's in our hot tub drinking our wine.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, he deserves to be alone.</br></p>", "7411": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I wonder if this is what it feels like to be Bernadette's baby.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I don't know. Bernadette's baby doesn't have a Jacuzzi jet hitting just the right spot.</p>", "7412": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Those jets are for my secret spot, not his!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What do you do in there?!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's called relaxing, and that's all you need to know.</p>", "7413": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, technically, I'd be moving in with my boyfriend?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I guess so. I'd finally get to live alone with my husband.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, my, this is a big step.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mm-hmm. For two of us, it's in the right direction.</p>", "7414": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What if living together kills the romance?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, you guys had sex one whole time. Nothing can put out a fire like that.</p>", "7415": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong>  Star Trek: The Original Series. The Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds. Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that's how you do it.<br/>\n*Leonard smiles at Penny*<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Don't be proud of that.</p>", "7416": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, this is so exciting.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, now, don't be surprised if, like Star Trek, it's canceled in three.</p>", "7417": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Let me see the sonogram again. (laughs) Oh, yeah, that's a good-looking baby for a little gray blob.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, we could name him Blobert.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What if it's a girl?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Bloberta. Or Blobbi with an \"I.\"</p>", "7418": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You've been roommates with Sheldon forever. Do you have any advice?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm trying to think of an answer that won't stop you from doing this.</p>", "7419": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't know. I didn't count.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's me.</p>", "7420": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, if you're nervous about the sleeping arrangements, maybe we should talk about it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. Talk.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Look, I know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone. So why don't we take being physical off the table and maybe later on, once we're more settled in, we can revisit it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're really okay with that?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I've never lived with someone, either. This is a lot for me, too.</p>", "7421": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, don't forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.</p>", "7422": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm on it. Fifteen years from now, we'll make guacamole together.</p>", "7423": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. Okay, now, on this side, I am closer to the exit in case of emergency.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Great. That's your side.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, but I'm also closer to the entrance in case of attack.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, I'll take that side.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Rising rapidly.</p>", "7424": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay. What if we do this? (Amy closes the drapes)<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I suppose that works.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Great.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Although now I'm kind of worried someone's hiding behind those drapes.</p>", "7425": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I've made more than enough accommodations for you. We're both grown adults. We've been far more intimate than this. If you don't want to snuggle, fine. But we're not building a pillow wall.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, well, I am sorry. I'm just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. And no offense, but your bottom radiates enough heat, I'm surprised there aren't iguanas lying on it.</br></p>", "7426": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow! Where did you learn these moves?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution, but not this smooth criminal.</p>", "7427": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't know if I can make it through five weeks living with him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If you ever need a break, the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee.</p>", "7428": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good morning! See? I didn't knock, but it's fine. (Quietly to himself) I didn't knock, but it's fine. I didn't knock, but it's fine.</p>", "7429": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wow. I anticipated we'd have problems, but I never thought your scientific rigor would be one of them.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Was that a science diss?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Was it a good one?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Meh.</p>", "7430": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway? I mean, you wouldn't know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time! And you don't even get that joke, 'cause you don't even work with confounding variables!</p>", "7431": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How dare you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, you heard me. Your experimental bona fides are laughable.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Whoa, whoa! Now you're making fun of my bona fides?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Can't make fun of something that's a null set.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I feel like I should say \"damn!\" <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Damn!</p>", "7432": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, for science, maybe I will!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For science, maybe you should!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Fine!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Good.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Great.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you want to go to our place and make out?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?</p>", "7433": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am cool. This is YooHoo. Chocolate milk's delicious, watery cousin.</p>", "7434": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone.</p>", "7435": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> If you're tired, have some coffee.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What? You have some coffee.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I am having coffee.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And look how irritable it's making you!</p>", "7436": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't think I can go much longer.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's been three and a half minutes, wake up!</p>", "7437": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, what are you guys gonna do today?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, Sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon, but I don't think that's happening.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that was never happening.</p>", "7438": "<p><strong>The Flash:</strong> Here, it's on the house.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The first one's free? Flash, how do you stay in business?<br/><strong>The Flash:</strong> You want to know my secret? I bought stock in Marvel.</p>", "7439": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I should probably keep this in case we have a girl.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, that's a nice one. Was it yours when you were little?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> My dad built it for me.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wow, it's so cute.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> This was the husband and this was the wife. They'd go out on adventures together. Cruises, skiing, horseback riding. That was really me just duct taping them to our dog.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, and did they have kids?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> They did, but the mommy and daddy didn't like them, so they shipped them off to an orphanage I made out of a shoebox.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, that's not worrisome at all.</p>", "7440": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Well, I guess this is kind of a bust. You don't have to stay. I'm gonna start cleaning up.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I feel so bad about leaving him here.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, it's funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you.</br></p>", "7441": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Hey, listen, could you not say anything about this to the people at the university? You know, 'cause you're you and I'm me, and it's kind of embarrassing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, what do you mean \"she's her\"?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Well, you know how Amy's the coolest girl on campus, right?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Oh yeah, everybody thinks so.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What? You tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?</p>", "7442": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> And when Amy started using a solution of chromic acid and white vinegar to clean all her lab equipment, all of a sudden, everybody was doing it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You trend setter!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Just the right idea at the right time.</p>", "7443": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm gonna get some coffee. You want some?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me when I'm trying to get my life back on track?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I do.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You don't.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, but I do.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, you don't! But let's say you do. And don't say you do, because you don't! Now, wouldn't you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> With what?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Your problem.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I thought I didn't have a problem.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That was painful to watch.</p>", "7444": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So where are we going?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't know.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay. How Thelma and Louise of us.</p>", "7445": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I keep waiting to feel excited, but it's not happening. What if it never happens?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Bernadette, come on, look, you're over thinking this, okay? You're gonna be an amazing mom. Even if you don't believe it, I know you have maternal instincts.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers. Our neighbor found them naked in the backyard eating crickets.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Happy and well-fed. You see, that's what I'm taking from that story.</p>", "7446": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, can I ask you a question?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard, can I ask you a question?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No.</p>", "7447": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look at this. Elon Musk has a theory that we're all just characters in some advanced civilization's video game.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, he doesn't say it's a good game.</p>", "7448": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You realize if the military declares our research classified, they can take the whole thing away from us.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And if that happens, we'll never be able to sell it commercially.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> There goes our big payday.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I was counting on that money. I need to make as much as my wife so I don't have to try so hard in bed.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You do that, too?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, yeah. How do you think I stay this thin?</p>", "7449": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Gentlemen, I think we are losing sight of the real issue. We are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the military-industrial complex. Isn't that exciting?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You're kidding, right?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not at all. In Star Wars, when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation, harassing civilians, didn't you ever think, \"Hey, that could be me\"?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, Howard's on board.</p>", "7450": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't believe this.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What's wrong?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You did already know, right?</p>", "7451": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's not a bad idea.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, you must have someone in your family that's a lawyer.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why? Because I'm Jewish? That's like me saying, \"Hey, you're Indian. Doesn't your cousin work in a call center?\"<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> My cousin does work in a call center.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And my cousin's a lawyer.</p>", "7452": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Give me a second to call my cousin.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't see how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> First of all, he's in Boca Raton, which is better than Fort Lauderdale. But more importantly, he lasted two days on Jeopardy, so he's clearly a smart guy.</p>", "7453": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What brings you by?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, had to go to a sales seminar on our new sleeping pill.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, how was it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Great.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Fell asleep?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> In, like, two minutes.</p>", "7454": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, you know, I also lied about the girl in the bathroom. Yeah, we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth.</p>", "7455": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ooh, can I use text-to-speech software?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> No!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't speak.<br/><strong>Sheldon's phone:</strong> (electronic male voice) Aw, nuts.</br></p>", "7456": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hi. Howard told me you were working late, so I brought dinner.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, thanks. You know, I just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat?</p>", "7457": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I am really regretting that I got you a Happy Meal.</p>", "7458": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look, I'm sorry. Tell me why Bernadette is upset with you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I told people at work that she's pregnant. She wasn't ready for them to know.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why would you do that?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, it just slipped out. I feel terrible.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> See, that's exactly what happened to me, except that I said it on purpose, and I have no regrets.</p>", "7459": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Is it even possible to get this done in two months?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, maybe. I don't know. We'll have to work twelve hours a day, seven days a week.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Which means I won't be able to make Penny breakfast every day, and she'll realize my brioche French toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I love your French toast.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, thanks, man.</p>", "7460": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Wow. You're going off to work with the military, leaving me behind. Now I know how all those army wives feel.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Would you stop? We're just gonna be on the other side of campus.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And right here. (holding his hand on his chest)<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You are a deeply silly man.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (To Leonard) He is so afraid of his feelings.</p>", "7461": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I just wanted to apologize. I know what you did was an accident.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, thank you, and I'm sorry I lied about it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> For what it's worth, you're a great liar.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's what Amy said.</p>", "7462": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wish we weren't so far from my parking space.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The way you put away those lemon bars, perhaps that's a good thing.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'd like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why? It clearly doesn't work.</p>", "7463": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, hey, and do yourself a favor, all right? When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night.<br/>\nAll right? As far as you're concerned, you don't know anything, you didn't see anything. I want you just to play dumb.<br/>\n*Beverly is standing in the doorway behind Penny, listening to the conversation*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.</p>", "7464": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Penny, wait.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I wanted to thank you for going through all the trouble of planning a second wedding ceremony for me, but unfortunately I cannot attend.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait, why? What's wrong?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wha- Are we still doing the dumb thing? Okay, why, what's wrong?</p>", "7465": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I just cannot stay here while your father goes out of his way to humiliate me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Stop it, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do I say \"Stop what?\" or just throw in the towel?</p>", "7466": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this. Please stay.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, plus if you leave, Alfred will know he got under your skin.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> (slowly thinks about it) Well, we can't have that.</p>", "7467": "<p><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Hello. I'm looking for Howard Wolowitz.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Howard Wolowitz?<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> I have the right address, don't I?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Address?<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Is he here?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Um, no.<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Do you know where I can find him?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> May I ask what this is about?<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> No, you may not.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Very well. (tips his hat)<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Have him call me.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay.<br/>\n(Colonel Williams starts to walk away)<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (off-screen) Raj, who's at the door?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (To Colonel Williams) That's not him.</p>", "7468": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I can't wait for you to meet everyone. I told them all about you.<br/><strong>Susan:</strong> Like what? Do they know about your brother?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, not everything. Just, like, the jail and drugs part.</p>", "7469": "<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Why would you do that?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Susan:</strong> The world doesn't need to know our problems.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, Mom, I'm sorry, but-<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Hey, look, they got Walgreens here, too.<br/><strong>Susan:</strong> You really think it's helpful to change the subject, Wyatt?<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Just trying to make this a happy trip, dear.<br/><strong>Susan:</strong> Well, quit it!</p>", "7470": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Uh, this is Howard Wolowitz for Colonel Richard Williams.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, I take it back, don't mention me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hi, Colonel Williams, how can I help you? What? Oh, uh, yes, he is from India. No, I don't know his immigration status. (Raj looks panicked.)<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (To Raj) Relax, I'm still on hold!</br></p>", "7471": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm glad you decided to stay. It's gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I can't wait for this day to be over.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, special, like that.</p>", "7472": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's them. Please don't make things any more awkward than they already are.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, so less or equally awkward, got it.</p>", "7473": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Listen, Mom, I know you're nervous, but I promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family.<br/><strong>Susan:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry. It's just we're meeting Leonard's parents for the first time, and-and they're academics and-and intellectuals, and I don't want them thinking we're white trash.<br/><strong>Randall:</strong> Well, what color trash do you think they'll believe?</p>", "7474": "<p><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> How could you think that I would spend the night with a man I just met?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa. You're kind of a sucker.</p>", "7475": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again.<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> Well, you know, actually that's not the case. Mary may visit me in New York.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Mm-hmm. And he's never been to Texas.<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> Maybe we meet halfway.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia? I can't be the only one that knows that's halfway.</p>", "7476": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you saying that my dad's not good enough for your mom?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. Pretty efficient, huh?</p>", "7477": "<p><strong>Susan:</strong> No more drug talk for the rest of this trip.<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> I'll drink to that.<br/><strong>Susan:</strong> Haven't you had enough?<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Penny drinks more than I do.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I learned from the best.<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Aw! (Penny and Wyatt clink their beer bottles together)</p>", "7478": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> There he is! There's my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah, that's the smile I'm gonna remember when you're living in the desert and I'm living with your wife.</p>", "7479": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> So, what do you do for a living?<br/><strong>Randall:</strong> Mommy, you want to take this one?<br/><strong>Susan:</strong> Um, Randall's in between jobs.<br/><strong>Randall:</strong> (whispering) And court appearances.</p>", "7480": "<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Thank you for cleaning yourself up for your sister's wedding.<br/><strong>Randall:</strong> Thank you for my new teeth.</p>", "7481": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We're here today to celebrate love.<br/>\n(Beverly sighs loudly)<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> Sigh louder, no one heard you!</p>", "7482": "<p><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> I'd like to say something. Beverly, I know that we don't bring out the best in each other. But something wonderful did come from our relationship, that young man right there.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I couldn't agree more.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> (tearing up) That's beautiful.</p>", "7483": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Thank you for taking us to the airport.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, I'm just thrilled we're all getting along for a minute.<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> Yeah, me, too. Beverly, I'm sorry if I upset you.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Water under the bridge, Alfred. Leonard, why don't you get into the carpool lane?<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> Well, that's a solid line. He can't cross it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's okay. I can make it over.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> No, no, let's plod along. It'll make your father feel more comfortable.<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> What makes me comfortable is knowing I don't have to wake up tomorrow morning and see your sour face.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Do the world a favor, and don't wake up tomorrow morning.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That was almost a minute.</p>", "7484": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on, it'll be fun, and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt we didn't invite her to the first one.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, in our defense, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing, and also, we don't like her.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard, come on, she's your mom. If we can do something to make her happy, why wouldn't we?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I just said why, we don't like her.</p>", "7485": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, so it's not a legal ceremony, it's just a chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> So there's no maid of honour?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Huh. But if I were to, say, wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you, you wouldn't be able to stop me, right?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't see how I could.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Then I graciously accept.</br></p>", "7486": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I can't believe I was so naive. The military is just gonna take over the whole project. And you know what happens if we object? We disappear. Like off the map. Like every American Idol winner since season four.</p>", "7487": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Come on, Howard, you're overreacting.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Am I? Am I? What do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and I'm no longer in it? That chess club picture is now just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.</p>", "7488": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, I, I know things are a little rough with you and Mom, but I'm really glad you're here.<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> Me, too. I should have never had that angioplasty because I feel fine.</p>", "7489": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm just afraid if I respond, then they'll know I got it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, dude. The minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it. I mean, they're probably looking at you through the camera right now. (Howard closes the laptop, Raj re-opens it and looks at the camera) I love America!</p>", "7490": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Are you done with this nonsense?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's not nonsense. This is how the U.S. military works.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, if it's even the U.S. Military. It could be foreign military pretending to be American.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're right. We turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they're using it against us.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (Raj opens the laptop again) I also love the enemies of America.</p>", "7491": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Howard, there must be someone at the university you can go to for help.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Are you kidding? They're probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What about the guy on the Channel Four News? You know, Four on Your Side? Maybe he can be on your side.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm being harassed by the government, not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam.</p>", "7492": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, stop. You know what's really happening? All the movies you've watched, the TV shows, the comic books, they've completely twisted your thinking. No one's after you, no one's listening to you, no one cares about you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'd like to think the Four on Your Side guy cares about me.</p>", "7493": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred have your differences, but if you think about it, if you hadn't married him, there'd be no Leonard. So that's good, right?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> (unemphatic) Yeah.</p>", "7494": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> He's flashing his lights. What's that mean?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I think he wants us to pull over.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Do not pull over. I'm not raising this baby alone.</p>", "7495": "<p><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> So, after your husband passed, you never remarried?<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> No, just focused on work and the church.<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> Ah. And what do you do?<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> I work at the church.</p>", "7496": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you realize what's happening here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I do. They're filling up on bread and ruining their meal.</p>", "7497": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What took you guys so long?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, we were following Howard, but for some reason, he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street.</p>", "7498": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (To Alfred) If I'd known you were broke, I wouldnt have made a big deal about the bread. (Moves a basket of bread over to Alfred)</p>", "7499": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> See, that's funny because-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Back to your phone.</p>", "7500": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny, I've always known I loved you, but this last year has shown me that I also love being married to you. Thank you for saying yes.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, thanks for asking until I did.</br></p>", "7501": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, hey, Penny, do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thanks.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No problem.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, Penny, um, since you're already gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?</p>", "7502": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why don't you want to get your mother from the airport?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She can cover it in a car ride? I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone.</p>", "7503": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> We've waited in a lot of lines together, havent we?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Remember when we camped out for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets.</p>", "7504": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, just when I think we're making progress in our relationship, we revert to our old patterns where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed. I mean, if he didn't want to go shopping with me, why didn't he just say so?<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> Maybe he couldn't get a word in edgewise.</p>", "7505": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, you know what? This is ridiculous. I've been trying to make a connection with you all day, and clearly I'm getting nowhere.<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> Well, are you seeking a connection or just some form of validation?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What I was seeking was some sort of friendship. But at this point, I'll take you not insulting me to my face.<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> My intention was never to insult you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You've been doing it all day. Do you even know what an insult is?<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> Well, it's not a clinical term. But one example would be your marrying my son, and not inviting me or even telling me the wedding was taking place.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, good example.</p>", "7506": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas to see us get married, you would've come?<br/><strong>Beverly:</strong> No, I would've said you're making a huge mistake. But an invitation would've been nice.</p>", "7507": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than I thought.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, the fun doesn't stop. You're still going home with a goodie bag full of toast.</p>", "7508": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And any time you need a break from being Bernadette the Pregnant, Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I might just take you up on that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, mind you, now, that offer's only good until the third trimester. I can't risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot.</p>", "7509": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Morning.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Morning.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ugh, too much wine.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I overdid it myself last night. Hair of the dog.</p>", "7510": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I'm going. You couldn't stop me from getting a massage at the mall, and you're not stopping me now.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I shouldn't have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And I shouldn't have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> The little choo-choo for toddlers?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And now you know why I needed the massage.</p>", "7511": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> They know that we're not exclusive, and we just don't ask too many questions.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, it's like how I play Warlords of Ka'a with you and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Who's Frank and Alicia?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You, you and I spend a lot of time together. Can there be a little mystery between us?</p>", "7512": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am going to record this for posterity.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, here goes nothing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Here goes nothing? This is the initial test of our prototype. Can we give it a little more gravitas?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fine. Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system, phase one commencing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Eh, maybe it's your voice. I'm gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post.</p>", "7513": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, you ready to go?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hang on.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. It teaches the different flavor notes to look for.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You actually smell the wine?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I mostly just smell my nasal spray.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are your sinuses acting up?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Since my preschool got a bunny.</p>", "7514": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, Sheldon and Bernadette are hanging out.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I know. What are they gonna talk about?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't know. I really don't know.</p>", "7515": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, Penny, isn't that your old boyfriend Zack?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, yeah.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you gonna say hi to him?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Um, I don't know.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, while you decide, who was better in bed, big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard? Neener-neener.</br></p>", "7516": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You can't let this stop you. Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's true. Even Einstein's theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> E equals MC squared. Yeah. E is for energy, M for mass, and C for the speed of light.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> How do you know that?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer.</p>", "7517": "<p>(at the urinals)<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe we should take a step back.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Take a step back? I'm not a young man any more.</p>", "7518": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, then. Geez, how much wine did you drink?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not a lot. I just couldn't start until you walked away.</p>", "7519": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring. You block it with your shield. Do you attack?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Does it have eyes?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Three giant red ones and they never blink. It's unsettling.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I stab it in the middle eye.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good choice. Critical hit. Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. With its final dying gasp, it says, \"You have reduced me to a pile of sushi. Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. Its low sodium. Aaaargh.\"</p>", "7520": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, by the way, don't forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, Sheldon, we don't need a meeting every three months.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm? Well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting. Lucky for you, it's tomorrow.</p>", "7521": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg's Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're the only one who eats them.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And yet you get to weigh in. Democracy, it's pretty cool, isn't it?</p>", "7522": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're being ridiculous.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's a motion on the floor, I'm ridiculous. Do we have a second? Hmm? Hmm? There is no second. The motion is denied. Next time, make sure you have the votes first. That was embarrassing.</p>", "7523": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, why are you fighting him on this?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because I am tired of him always getting his way. We don't need a stupid meeting. We don't even need a roommate agreement, and I hope that sandwich does cause a party.</p>", "7524": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why are you taking his side?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Because it's important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You keep talking like that, you're gonna make color guard.</p>", "7525": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> But, dude, you're so lucky. Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I guess I am lucky.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You are, because dating two women, I mean, I can't even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and I'm like, am I at Claire's or am I at Emily's? Is there a third girl I've forgotten about? Like, where am I?</p>", "7526": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mmm, I think so. Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I don't know. Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off.</p>", "7527": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know you're gonna make up with him. Can we just skip to that part?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, of course, because I'm the only adult around here.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? The only adult?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, that's right.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Tonight, I'll be watching a show rated MA, and that stands for mature audiences, buster.</p>", "7528": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All this could be avoided if you'd just come to the meeting.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't want to.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, it's just a meeting. One simple meeting.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Stop saying meeting.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Meeting, meeting, bow-beeting, banana-fana, fo-feeting, fee-fi mo-meeting.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I brought my famous spinach dip.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, Amy, just one second. Meeting.</p>", "7529": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> If it's a girl, I mean, they're so innocent and you know how guys are.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Totally, guys are the worst. I mean, look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claires fridge that night. I'm such a dog.</p>", "7530": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What's going on with him?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, he's all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Apparently, perfect attendance isn't cool any more.</br></p>", "7531": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, did I say something to upset you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, I'm fine.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really? Because usually we walk side by side, and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom.</p>", "7532": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, I think I see what's happening here. You're jealous of me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, please. What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's not what I have, it's how many people I'm having it with.</p>", "7533": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hey, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Stuart.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Uh, is this not a dress-up party?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Was it ever a dress-up party?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Howard, didn't you tell me it was a dress-up party?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah.</p>", "7534": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I'll catch you up. Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard's angry at me and Penny, I'm angry at Leonard and Amy, Raj is angry at Howard, and I'm angry at George R.R. Martin 'cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard.</p>", "7535": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> That was scary.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, the important thing is I said that big sandwich would ruin everything, and I was right.</p>", "7536": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> *Knock, knock, knock* Leonard. *Knock, knock, knock* Leonard. *Knock, knock, knock* Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I never got to ask my question about Batman.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What is it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat, and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat, would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (a moment's pause) I'll be back.</p>", "7537": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What am I smelling?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, it's car air freshener. I was simulating the smell of the forest.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's not what the forest smells like.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, how would I know?</p>", "7538": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> We could all go for the weekend. It'll be fun.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me. (Gets up and hands Amy a dictionary) Here, look up fun, get back to me.</p>", "7539": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You and I could still go and have a nice weekend.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Come on, Sheldon, let's go with them.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I hardly think so. You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars.</p>", "7540": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't think so. He just wants to be part of the experience.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, if you say so. What's in the box?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, it's an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby's heartbeat.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. That's cool. Can we try it?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Actually, Raj ordered it. He made me promise to wait till he was here.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So he can be part of the experience?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm surprised he let us conceive without him.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's a sore spot, don't bring it up.</p>", "7541": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> It's so cute and rustic up here.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know. Did you see they still have a video rental place? It's like colonial Williamsburg.</p>", "7542": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> This place is great.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert, so hold that thought.</p>", "7543": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So what do we do now?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> They have some board games.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word schnerf next to it, move on.</p>", "7544": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What's the game?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, it's called Never Have I Ever. The rules are simple. Someone says something they've never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I've never played that before.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, now, wait. Have we started? Do I drink? What is happening?</p>", "7545": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, my turn. Mm. Oh, I know. Never have I ever kept a secret bank account, because I think my wife can't handle money.<br>\nDid I win? I feel like I won.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I can't believe this. You realize I make more money than you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't - I know, but this isn't a big deal. It's just a little savings I put aside.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We're married. We're supposed to share everything.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm calling it. I won.</br></p>", "7546": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do with that kind of money?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I do, and that's why I hid it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What good is it if you don't use it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. I have money I love, but never spend. We're kind of a cute couple that way.</p>", "7547": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong>  Again, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have kept it a secret.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I have a secret I've been keeping from you, too.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome.</p>", "7548": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I hate my job.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? Why?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Because I don't feel good flirting with doctors for sales. I mean, I know I make a lot of money. But I haven't been happy for a while.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why didn't you tell me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Because I know how important it is to you that I'm having some success.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's not true.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, really? So you'd be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If that's what you want to do, yes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, it's not what I want to do.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, yes.</p>", "7549": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, here we go.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm not hearing anything.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, give me a second.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Are you sure you can do this?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I buried it there so we could go home.</p>", "7550": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Look, I'm sorry for your loss, but I think I have something that might make you feel better. I got you a new computer.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How could you do that?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Do what?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Choosing a new laptop is an incredibly personal ritual. You have taken away weeks of agonizing thought, tedious research, sleepless nights filled with indecision. Haven't I lost enough today?</p>", "7551": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We had a full spool yesterday.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What can I say, I play hard, I solder even harder.</p>", "7552": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off. It's like a beer commercial.</p>", "7553": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, funny story. So, we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder, but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to-lead.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. That is, is not a funny story.</p>", "7554": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. I'm sorry. Thank you for the thoughtful gift. I really do appreciate it. As you know, I had become attached to my old laptop. But I'm sure, in time, that this one will ... Jeepers creepers, that started up fast!</p>", "7555": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey. Where are the guys?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, they went to the store to get solder, which is metal you melt to make science things.</p>", "7556": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are we gonna tell the girls?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's not a problem.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I mean without lying.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And now you've made it a problem.</p>", "7557": "<p><strong>Cinema Worker:</strong> Uh, were gonna get started in a couple minutes. Enjoy. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Who are you texting?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Raj. He really wants to see this movie.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He'll never make it in time.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I know. I want to make him feel bad.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> \"Ha, ha. Leonard and I are about to see Suicide Squad. Spoiler alert, when I see you I'm gonna spoil it.\" You're a good friend.</p>", "7558": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Why do you have a storage unit?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just wait.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> How long have you had it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just wait.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you want me to hold that computer?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just wait. You know what? Actually, yes, thank you.</p>", "7559": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, how are we gonna play this when they return?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I know. You guys should totally be making out with me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny, but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us? (Penny gets close to Raj)<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, ma'am.</p>", "7560": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In here is every clock radio I've ever owned. Calculators, VHS tapes. Yeah. Oh, sporting equipment.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> You have sporting equipment?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, oh, it's just a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It's right next to the hockey puck dent.</br></p>", "7561": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, why do you feel you need to save these things?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'd like to say it's nostalgia, but every time I think of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and I get butterflies in my stomach. And then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats, and then the, the rats get eaten by...<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay. I get it. I get it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It ends with dinosaurs. I'm sorry if you think less of me.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? 'Cause every time I come in here, I think less of me.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because I'm a fraud. No, I purport to be a man of the mind. I've been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity. But how can I leave my body behind and become one with the Internet when I've never even thrown a toothbrush away?</p>", "7562": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, what's this?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Listen, we did a stupid thing.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad and want to make it up to you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, these are for you, and if you're not too mad, we'd love to take you guys to dinner.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah. Anywhere you want.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh. Well, thank you for being honest.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. You know, I want to be upset, but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype.</p>", "7563": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Ready for dinner?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Should we invite Raj?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (Inside the closet) Yes.</p>", "7564": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> That's me, your emotional outhouse. You know, if you ever decide you want to do something about this, I'm here for you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you. I wouldn't even know how to begin.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Baby steps, I guess.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, okay.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I will always have the dent to remember it by.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You did it. Do you feel okay?</p>", "7565": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, I gotta ask. Why are you wearing a bow tie?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've never applied for a patent before. I wanted to make a good impression.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?</p>", "7566": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, well, you're an engineer. End of joke, burn.</p>", "7567": "<p><strong>Patent Attorney:</strong> So, I've reviewed your paperwork, and it seems like we've got everything we need to file a patent for your infinite persistence gyroscope.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's great!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Excellent.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So what happens next?<br/><strong>Patent Attorney:</strong> Well, the legal team needs to review existing patents to avoid overlap.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, I don't think there will be.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, we did our own search.<br/><strong>Patent Attorney:</strong> That's nice, but I think ours might be a bit more thorough.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (chuckling) Get a load of this guy.</p>", "7568": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Can you imagine if we make money with this?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If we do, I am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That old sad story. Guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose.</p>", "7569": "<p><strong>Patent Attorney:</strong> Just need you to review and sign this document acknowledging that you understand the university will own 75% of the patent.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> 75%?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's outrageous. This is our idea based on our research. How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?<br/><strong>Patent Attorney:</strong> It's university policy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I know when I'm beat.</p>", "7570": "<p><strong>Patent Attorney:</strong> And as far as Mr. Wolowitz is concerned, I'm afraid as a federal employee on loan from NASA, your name can be on the patent, but you're not entitled to an ownership share.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wait, so this can turn out to be a financial success, and I get nothing?<br/><strong>Patent Attorney:</strong> Well, sometimes they give you a plaque.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that's not fair. We should all get plaques.</p>", "7571": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sorry, but we can't sign this.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Come on, let's go.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you for your time.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, couple of questions about the plaque- (Leonard pulls Sheldon out of the room)</p>", "7572": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, have you been having any morning sickness?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> A little. And it doesn't help that I've got this heightened sense of smell.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Is that a pregnancy thing?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, the other day I sniffed out where Howie hid the Girl Scout cookies. No more Tagalongs, my ass.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> But now you'll be able to make your own milk to eat the cookies with.</p>", "7573": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I mean, do I open it? Do I return it?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why wouldn't you open it?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, she was pretty mad. For all I know it's a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk.</p>", "7574": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You don't think she'd actually send you something gross or dangerous, do you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know one way to find out. Sniff this.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> She's pregnant, she's not a bloodhound.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Although I am getting a little machine oil. I think it's metal.</p>", "7575": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on, just open it.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, on Game of Thrones, Balon Greyjoy received his son's genitals in a box.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, never hurts to have a spare.</br></p>", "7576": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What is that?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wow, it's an antique sextant. Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I know, she's so thoughtful.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> See, she's trying to get you back. Now, that is exactly what I would've gotten you if I had any idea what it is or what you do.</p>", "7577": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, I have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You don't need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.</p>", "7578": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We can't. It says on their web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Great, so they own my idea for a T-shirt that says \"Dumb as a Bag of Geologists.\"</p>", "7579": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, our choices are we do this with the university or we don't do it at all.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Either way, I get nothing.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Or, if we ended up making money from this, Sheldon and I could split our shares with you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> To be clear, Leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the T-shirt and mugs.<br/>\nOh, now they own the mugs!</p>", "7580": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You guys would be cool doing it like that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Of course, we can split any profits three ways.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm fine with that.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, great.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure, we could write something up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But which one of us should be the party who-<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You can do it, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (excitedly) So stipulated!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed. It was weird.</p>", "7581": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I wonder how much she spent on this.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Ooh, let's find out.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It doesn't matter. It's the thought that counts.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, yeah. Beauty's on the inside, size doesn't matter - how much did she spend?</p>", "7582": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Seriously, guys, I don't want to know.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, my.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, come on, you can't say \"Oh, my!\" and then not tell me!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> These things go for $500 and up.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Damn! All I got for Valentine's Day was a postcard saying my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered.</p>", "7583": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, so, she drops off a $500 gift and she's not trying to get back together with you?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Maybe you're right.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Or she's telling the truth and just being nice.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Maybe you're right. Wow, I am easy to manipulate.</p>", "7584": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, guys, it's Emily. What should I do?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, answer it. Just be strong. And if she starts to cry, don't make any promises. And most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear.</p>", "7585": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> This contract looks good to me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll say it looks good. It's in my proprietary font, Shelvetica.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I want to say something obnoxious, but it is easy on the eyes.</p>", "7586": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm a little tired, Howie. You ready to go?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, one sec. I just need to sign this contract.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What is it?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent, so we're forming a partnership to split anything we make equally.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, did you draft the contract?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You bet I did.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh. (To Amy) You're gonna make out so hard tonight!</p>", "7587": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So, you're just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me. I've been drafting contracts since kindergarten. Didn't need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. Don't need one now.</p>", "7588": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If she doesn't think that we should apply for this patent, she's being patently absurd.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Good one.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, you got it. See, I was afraid it was a thinker.</p>", "7589": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I just want to make sure you've thought this through.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What's to think about? We have an invention and want to move forward.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie, you're about to form a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, if you're gonna calmly make excellent points, then I don't know if I want to talk to you.</p>", "7590": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, I get it. And it's sweet that you're worried about me, but I can take care of myself.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about me. I don't want to go through this pregnancy listening to you complain about Sheldon driving you crazy more than you already do.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, here we go with the ironclad logic again.</br></p>", "7591": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hello?<br/><strong>Claire:</strong> Hey, Raj. It's Claire. How are you?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hi. I'm good. Really good.<br/>\nWell, I don't know why I said \"really good.\" I'm just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that \"really\" was a real \"really\", not a fake \"really\" like the first \"really.\"<br/><strong>Claire:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know. I lost track and I missed my exit.</p>", "7592": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, uh so what's up?<br/><strong>Claire:</strong> Well, last time we talked, I had just gotten back together with my boyfriend, and I wanted to let you know that things didn't work out.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really? I'm sorry, I swear I know other words.</p>", "7593": "<p><strong>Claire:</strong> So if you were still interested-<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes! Indeed! Absolutely! Indubitably! I'm not even sure what the last one means, but it's another word, and I know it.</p>", "7594": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, uh, when do you want to meet up?<br/><strong>Claire:</strong> Uh, I'm almost off work. What are you doing now? Right now, well- Well, actually, tto be completely honest, I'm stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she's having a tough time. But it's not like we're getting back together or anything.<br/><strong>Claire:</strong> Let me guess, the worst part about breaking up is that she doesn't have her best friend to talk to anymore?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's exactly what she said! How do you know that?<br/><strong>Claire:</strong> I'm a girl. It's, like, page one out of the playbook.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Any chance you could send me a PDF of that playbook?</p>", "7595": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> But, um, we were talking, and I'm a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation? Cause I did not L-L-\"see\" that coming.</p>", "7596": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What if Sheldon had no choice but to be respectful?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is there a switch on the back of his neck we don't know about?</p>", "7597": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> No, what I'm saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he can't make fun of Howard.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How would you enforce it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, please. Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And his obsessive-compulsive disorder.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, that, too. And scoot over. Part of your shadow's on my spot.</p>", "7598": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Howard, what do you think?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm on board.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll add it right now. Oh, baby, it's addendum time!</p>", "7599": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The revisions I made start on page four.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow. That is a lot of \"whereupons\".<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You should see the Valentine's Day card he gave me.</p>", "7600": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> \"Article three: As it pertains to this project, Dr. Sheldon Cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or disrespectful language directed toward Howard Wolowitz, including but not limited to: mockery of engineering, his height, his hair, his wardrobe, and his insane belief that the Ghost Rider movie was, quote, 'not that bad'.\"</p>", "7601": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, wait, wait. What are these changes on page six?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, what did you do?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I should've known.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> \"25% of profits due to Sheldon Cooper will be allocated to a scholarship fund for the firstborn child of Howard and Bernadette Wolowitz.\" Sheldon, that's so nice.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That beats the onesie I was gonna get them from Baby Gap.</p>", "7602": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> That's very generous, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I've always valued education over money. And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I've been of your contributions.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I appreciate that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the sub-par education and menial life of an engineer.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What? I didn't sign it yet.</p>", "7603": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, I'd better go in there and talk to him.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, don't you think I'm the one who should go in?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No offense, but I've known the guy a really long time.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I've, you know, seen him without pants on.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Again, no offense, but so have I.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, he's seen me without pants on.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Again, -<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, this is ridiculous.</p>", "7604": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> And it was Gandhi who said, \"Live as if you were to die tomorrow. \u0153Learn as if you were to live forever.\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And it was Sheldon Cooper who said \"Let's speed this up. A lot of people want to talk.\"</p>", "7605": "<p><strong>Adam West:</strong> So, who's taking me home?</p>", "7606": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, where is he?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'll check his room.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Surprise!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, my God!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. Now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one?  Yeah, I suggest \"how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew?\" You know, the answer, it may surprise you.</br></p>", "7607": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Can you please just tell me why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year we'd have a party. No one I invited would ever come, because they didn't like me.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm sorry.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that part wasn't so bad. I didn't like them, either. But then I'd inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister's friends.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, you poor thing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window.</p>", "7608": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But who's gonna tell them they're doing it wrong?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I'm sure they'll ask you to give a speech, and that's when you just tear 'em a new one.</p>", "7609": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you all right?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I just I got a little light-headed.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, d-do you need a minute?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this.</p>", "7610": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ready to play when you are.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, um, in a minute. I actually need to tell you guys something.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> If it's \"thank you\" for the homemade jam you got in December, congratulations, you're the first one.</p>", "7611": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sorry, hormones.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's all right. All I heard was \"skinny.\"</p>", "7612": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Um, \"taking care of an injured rabbit.\" Okay, make sure it's comfortable and warm. Well, it was just in a hot tub. I'm gonna say check.</p>", "7613": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> No, Sheldon's right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship. Uh, perhaps even a red flag. And speaking of red flags, check out this sexy number from the former Soviet Union. Hubba, hubba.</p>", "7614": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I was just hungry and cranky, and I've never been called \"ma'am\" before.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is that a big deal?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Kind of. When was the first time someone called you \"sir\"?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sixth grade, but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, so...</p>", "7615": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Can you believe when I met you I was 22? I mean, it's crazy! Where did all that time go?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mmm, you watched The Bachelor a lot.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, they're not.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're closer to 40 than you are 30.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ha, ha! You married an old man.</p>", "7616": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Let's see. What's young and fun? Uh, we could go dancing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you actually gonna dance? Of course.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, no one wants to see that. Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach? <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I don't need any fish nibbling my business.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, there's a screening of Moulin Rouge! I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That sounds fun. When's it start?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Midnight.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Midnight, really? You know what? Let's do it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, great! Oh, wait. Uh, it's sold out.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, thank God.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes!</p>", "7617": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, hello, everyone. I am happy to report I'm feeling much better.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Good for you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free, and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Glad to hear it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll be able to return to work tomorrow.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yay.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, why isn't everyone happy? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again.</p>", "7618": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You really don't know why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. But I knew that his \"yay\" was sarcastic. Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.</p>", "7619": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon, stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She's a dermatologist.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> I went to medical school.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you.</p>", "7620": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, here you go.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, I'm dying.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're not dying. It's just the flu.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I asked for chicken noodle. This is chicken and stars. It's killing me.</br></p>", "7621": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I wish that all the time. Usually before I blow out birthday candles.</p>", "7622": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, Amy took some time off from him. Really improved their relationship.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Huh. Okay. As long as it doesn't end with us having coitus with him, I'm in.</p>", "7623": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, where are we going?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, Vegas, but-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy? No, thank you.</p>", "7624": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, fine. Then I'll just hang out with Wolowitz.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He's coming, too.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, then Raj and I will-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Nope.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Very well. Stuart.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, great. Do that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ugh, Stuart.</p>", "7625": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, get ready for an apology. And with the added twist of an M. Night Shyamalan movie, I'm going to mean it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ah, so like every other M. Night Shyamalan movie I've seen, you spoil it in advance.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, if you didn't know Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, that's not on me.</p>", "7626": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All you did was offer maternal care and affection, and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Can this wait?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm afraid it can't. The trip is tomorrow. And I have more apologies to make.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt while I take a quick-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard!</p>", "7627": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You brought me my comic books when I wasn't feeling well. That was thoughtful.<br/>\nAnd I was insensitive. I'm sorry.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Thank you, Sheldon. I appreciate that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And I want you to know that I mean it, you know? This isn't me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> What trip to Las Vegas?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The one everyone's taking this weekend on the party bus.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Of course. I wasn't invited.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That would be my understanding. On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?</p>", "7628": "<p><strong>Emily:</strong> Well, I don't accept your apology.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> It's called standing up for myself. You should try it some time.</p>", "7629": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you doing?!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My plan was to jump out at the state line, but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet.</p>", "7630": "<p><strong>Emily:</strong> You know, I know he's a jerk, but I actually feel bad for him.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And now you see the problem.</p>", "7631": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So, when are you thinking of moving?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Uh, actually, I already found an apartment, so in a couple of days.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, okay. Sorry to see you go?</p>", "7632": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, back to me. I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wait, what happened to us?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now, this isn't about us, this is about what's best for the asteroid.</p>", "7633": "<p><strong>Dr. Gallo:</strong> Got it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, do you have any questions?<br/><strong>Dr. Gallo:</strong> Just one. Mm-hmm? When you made your husband pretend to be a patient so you could get access to me, what were you thinking there?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I just meant a question about the drug.</p>", "7634": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is this what we're doing the rest of the night?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm surprised you have to ask.</p>", "7635": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So if you think that's creepy, you married the wrong guy.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Maybe I should marry Trent.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, like she could get Trent.</br></p>", "7636": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey. Good news, everybody. Now that I'm no longer with Amy, I have an extra ticket to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria. Who wants it? You realize you won't be going alone. I'll be there the whole time. Providing fish and pilgrim facts.</p>", "7637": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And feel free to tell your guest that the Myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish. In case the turkey's dry and you need something juicy.</p>", "7638": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No. You?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. Since last we spoke, have you planned or gone on any vacations?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I might go visit my aunt next week.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mmm. Your aunt in Modesto?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, the one in Bakersfield.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mmm, Bakersfield. I see. Where has this list been all my life?</p>", "7639": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And then the next day was 73 degrees, and the day after that was 72, and then it was 72 again. Uh, then it was 74, and that brings us to today, at, \"I'd wear shorts if I had a pair\" 78.</p>", "7640": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Are we done discussing the weather?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know if I'd call it \"discussing.\" You kind of sat back and let me do all the work.</p>", "7641": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, this reminds me of high school.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> You worked in a restaurant?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, I was in India. It was humid and smelled funny.</p>", "7642": "<p><strong>Elon Musk:</strong> Here you go.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thanks.<br/>\nYou got to be kidding me.<br/><strong>Elon Musk:</strong> Sorry?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're Elon Musk.<br/><strong>Elon Musk:</strong> I am.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What are you doing here?<br/><strong>Elon Musk:</strong> I'm washing dishes. Well, I was on the turkey line, but I got demoted for being too generous with the gravy.</p>", "7643": "<p><strong>Elon Musk:</strong> Oh, look. Someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie. Want to share it with me? <strong>Howard:</strong> A partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie from a homeless shelter with Elon Musk? You bet I do!</p>", "7644": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter, lovely to see you this fine morning.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're in a good mood.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I am indeed. I have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy, it is time that I find myself a new female companion.</p>", "7645": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you for coming by, gentlemen.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No problem.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> So what's up?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me.<br/>\nNow that I'm looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again.</p>", "7646": "<p><strong>Dave:</strong> Well, the next time you watch it, I'm the bloke who asked the question that he said was stupid and obvious. It was the nicest thing he said to anyone there.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's, um, terrific.</p>", "7647": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What if it's Jennifer Lawrence?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You thought she was great in X-Men.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, fine. I won't shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence.</p>", "7648": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, I'm Leonard. This is my friend-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh.</p>", "7649": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is this one of those times where I've won the battle but lost the war?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Afraid so, Skippy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I told you we shouldn't go shopping at night.</p>", "7650": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> You know he won't be looking at other girls.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Unless they're sitting on the end of his nose.</br></p>", "7651": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Right this way, Uncle Harvey.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Will you stop with that already?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm trying not to attract attention.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn't do that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She said, \"Buenas noches.\" What was he supposed to do?</p>", "7652": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> What's going on with Amy?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not that it's any of your business, but she broke up with me.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Really? Good to know.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> \"Good to know\"? What's that supposed to mean?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I hate to say it, but it sounds like he's interested in her.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that's unacceptable.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, buddy, I get that you don't like it. But it's not really up to you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, but he's dumb, and his face is dumb.</p>", "7653": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, I don't have it all worked out yet, but I was thinking something like:<br/>\n\"Oh, Indy. Oh, Indy. The skies are so windy. Is that a flying man with a killer bod? Wait That's no man, it's a Norse god.\"</p>", "7654": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> \"Thunder clapped as Thor raised his mighty hammer. Indy rapped, 'That's one bad mamma-jamma.'<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That-that is so good!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Right? Mamma-jamma just came to me.</p>", "7655": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, look, we don't need to rush into anything. All right? Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me, we just leave things the way they are, and sometimes we'll sleep over there, and sometimes we'll sleep over here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But mostly here?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sure.</p>", "7656": "<p><strong>Wyatt:</strong> I've been sitting on a little news myself.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, what is it?<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> You know that rototiller I got for the tractor?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Oh, you should see it. It is a beautiful piece of machinery. Anyway, uh, I backed over your pet pig with it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Moondance?<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Yeah, he's, uh, not dancing anymore.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You killed my pig?<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> I did not kill him. The vet took care of that.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> When?<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Oh, ten, twelve months ago.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You didn't tell me for a year?<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Well, apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it? Love ya, slugger. Gotta go.</p>", "7657": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> We are going to Me-he-co.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fun! I've never been there.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, don't be fooled. I'm from Texas. Me-he-co is Spanish for Mexico.</p>", "7658": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The way I see it, there's a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action.</p>", "7659": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> And you have every right to be mad about those things, so why don't you let me handle the credit card bill for this month? Don't even look at it.</p>", "7660": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Leonard, wait.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'd like to Spongebob her Squarepants.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Now we are done.</p>", "7661": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, Leonard. When you're done, we came up with a bunch more.</p>", "7662": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sometimes I worry you're going to wake up and leave me for someone more like you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't even understand why you're with someone like me. Why would I want to be with someone like me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know what I mean. And maybe the way I've been reacting was me sabotaging this, too.</p>", "7663": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm not saying anything bad. Just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.</p>", "7664": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, and here's a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree. <br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> You don't look very happy. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life.</p>", "7665": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> It's time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. <br>\n*garbage falls out of the bottom of bag*<br/>\nBernie, I made a mess!</br></p>", "7666": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> See this right here. What you're doing. Can you please not do that around Sheldon's mom?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Why, are you attracted to her, too?</p>", "7667": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I've never been to New Jersey before. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives. <br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So it's not really like that? <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, it's like that.</p>", "7668": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What does red and yellow mean? <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It means the calibration failed. We have to start over. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Very well. Reinitiating calibration sequence. *flips switch rapidly* One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten... *lights on drone don't turn solid yellow* eleven. It's a good thing I didn't send that letter.</p>", "7669": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hello, Daddy. <br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> What did you say to your mother? <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Nothing. I was just calling to check in, make sure she's doing okay. <br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Well, after talking to you, she seems to think I'm some sort of playboy. <br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really? I don't know where she'd get an idea like that.</p>", "7670": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What happened to me? When did I become an old man baffled by modern technology? Next thing you know, I'll be hitching my pants up to my armpits and complaining about the awful music the kids are listening to. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It is awful, isn't it? Listen to that noise.</p>", "7671": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on, you're packed.</p>", "7672": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, hello. Hi. I didn't know he was going to point it at me, so don't do drugs and stay in school.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> They're graduating.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, bye!</p>", "7673": "<p><strong>Mrs. Koothrapalli:</strong> Hello, Rajesh. What a nice surprise.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I've been thinking about you. How are you doing? Are you happy, Mummy?<br/><strong>Mrs. Koothrapalli:</strong> Such a sweet boy for asking. Cant believe you come from the poison seed of your father.</p>", "7674": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hi. Hello. And a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Subtle.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But you got it right.</p>", "7675": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, where do you want to hang it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you kidding? We're not hanging it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But it's an ex<x>pression of our love.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And our butts. Not hanging it.</x></p>", "7676": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> This is kind of creepy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We're not supposed to talk during this part.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sorry.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is kind of creepy.</p>", "7677": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> One calls it insightful and innovative. We're insightful and innovative.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ah, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative.</p>", "7678": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> It's not about me and Sheldon. It's about a young woman in the 1800s named Amelia, and the time-traveling physicist named Cooper she falls in love with.</p>", "7679": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you really want him to write back?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I do. And no matter how he responds, I'm going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying \"Oh, really?\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mee-wow.</p>", "7680": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Your George Lucas autograph is really a me autograph.</p>", "7681": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Go ahead. You can't embarrass me. I have a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater.</p>", "7682": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, we are just people. We talk about the same things you guys talk about.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You talk about if werewolves can swim? See, Leonard says yes, but I say it depends on whether the human could swim before he was bitten. What do you think?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Let's just talk about our periods.</br></p>", "7683": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It all comes down to this. <br/>\n(Raj shoots bottle in a trash can)<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You happy? Now you can relax.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What kind of a scientist are you?! Everyone knows you've got to make two out of three!</p>", "7684": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> I see you got engaged.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes, we did.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Let me tell you a story.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Dad.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Sorry. I'm sure you won't grow to hate each other.</p>", "7685": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Bernadette's just parking the car.<br/><strong>Dan:</strong> Oh good. Bernadette. Cute, sweet, vicious, little Bernadette.</p>", "7686": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> This is so messed up.<br/><strong>Emily:</strong> I know, I'm having the best time.</p>", "7687": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> (fanning himself) Oh, this heat is brutal!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As someone from the tropical sub-continent of India, you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Huh. That does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me.</p>", "7688": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, that's not good. You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on.</p>", "7689": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So you want me to be a teacher's pet?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Couldn't hurt.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. Who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacher's pet?<br/>\n*Sheldon, Amy, Howard, Leonard and Raj raise their hands*</p>", "7690": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hi, wanna do yoga with me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Let me just have some coffee first and then I'll have the strength to tell you how much I won't be doing that.</p>", "7691": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> A butterfly could have gotten himself home from Arizona.</p>", "7692": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So when will you reopen?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I don't know. I'm waiting to hear back from the insurance company.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So tomorrow?</p>", "7693": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Would you like me to play some Polish music while you carry her to the toilet?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You are a putz.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> As advertised.</p>", "7694": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That was awkward, right?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh huh.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is it because she's dating you but was out with that other fella?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.</p>", "7695": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Wouldn't you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can't happen. We have an iron-clad relationship agreement which precludes her from sexual contact with anyone other than me.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> But you don't have sex with her either.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Slick, huh?</br></p>", "7696": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm fine.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay ... and yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box.</p>", "7697": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I think he's taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Should we try to console him?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> By staying here and watching the movie?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's what good friends would do!</p>", "7698": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look at Arthur cracking up at a joke I made. I'll never hear that joke again.<br/><strong>Arthur:</strong> You never heard it that time.</p>", "7699": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For your information, I was asking her about the next Star Trek movie.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I can answer that one: I'll be bored.</p>", "7700": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, it's not like cotton candy comes out of you.</p>", "7701": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Before I met Sheldon I was ready to give up too. Once, I even called in on my OBGYN just for some human contact.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.</p>", "7702": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> It's just so humiliating.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> \"So humiliating?\" Am I driving you to the Cheesecake factory or - I'm sorry, I'll stop. I'll stop.</p>", "7703": "<p><strong>Mike Massimino:</strong> You know how astronauts need to have the right stuff?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Mike Massimino:</strong> The stuff you have is wrong.</p>", "7704": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If you'll recall, the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's a made up story, Leonard. I don't know why you're even talking about it.</p>", "7705": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Translation?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wah, I don't want a table.</p>", "7706": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> So, anyway, there's this big, uh, rock and mineral show next week in Santa Monica.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Listen, um, Bert, before you say anything else, I- I have a boyfriend.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Oh. This is awkward. You thought I was gonna ask you to go with me to the mineral show.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Weren't you?<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Yeah.</p>", "7707": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> That's very nice of you, but I do have a boyfriend.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> That's what you all say. You just don't want to go out with me because I have an off-putting personality.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, that's not true. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like, way worse than you.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Don't worry. I'm used to it. I mean, I'm big and weird and funny-looking and no one ever wants to do anything with me.</p>", "7708": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> It's okay. I know I'm a monster.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, Bert, come on. I'd love to go to the mineral show with you.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Sweet. It's a date. (Leaves Amy's office)<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, it's not.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Too late!</p>", "7709": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> Thanks for coming to the mineral and rock show with me.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> We\u2019re sorry Amy didn't want to go.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really, really sorry.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Eh. Who needs her when I have you guys? Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock sho-o-o-o-ow!</p>", "7710": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What's your part?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> I play a customer in a diner and I flirt with Mark Harmon.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ooh, Mark Harmon. He's a dreamboat.</br></p>", "7711": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, can we talk?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We can, but the part of Penny might get cut.<br/></p>", "7712": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Here's another one. Penny, if it weren't for Sheldon, you never would have met comic book legend Stan Lee.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Great.</p>", "7713": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So what prescription are you getting filled?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No wait, I want to guess. Don't tell me.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  I wasn't going to tell you.</p>", "7714": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, wait. I'm really good at this. Give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  Well, given my age, that's more than just a lucky guess.</p>", "7715": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Have you ever wondered why Arthur didn't want you to read his paper?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills.</p>", "7716": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  What do you want, Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  She sounds like a keeper.</p>", "7717": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help. Because a lot of people think you're a washed up has-been ... or dead.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  I should be so lucky. </p>", "7718": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  If someone had told me people would still call me Professor Proton when I was eighty-three years old, I never would have quit smoking.</p>", "7719": "<p><strong>Bill Nye:</strong> What are you guys working on?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We're making nano-vacuum tubes.<br/>\nBill Nye: Interesting.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  Haven't you stolen enough from? Back off bow-tie!</p>", "7720": "<p>*Leonard's phone vibrates*<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, God.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  What is it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.</p>", "7721": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, gees.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  Another photo from Sheldon?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> He probably stole his wallet too.</p>", "7722": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Arthur, I'm surprised to see your here.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  Yeah, me too. Somewhere around the third floor I began to see a white light.</p>", "7723": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We did them at Princeton, too.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, that's cute. Like it's a real college.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's amusing. I was going to say the same about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too.</p>", "7724": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You really think he's gonna send us to a bowling alley?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are? They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams.</p>", "7725": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes, to be fair, do people who went to Princeton get a head start?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not funny.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It's based on the premise that Princeton isn't a very good school.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ha-ha.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, see, now he gets it.</br></p>", "7726": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I have asthma. Back off!</p>", "7727": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait, I got it. I got it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Congratulations. You got it last.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're really mean, you know that?</p>", "7728": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's dirty laundry. You're up.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What? Why me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because you've been training for this your whole life. You live in a pile of dirty laundry.</p>", "7729": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> They're here first. This is because you made me slow down for that blind guy.</p>", "7730": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Have you ever played a game with Bernadette?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine?</p>", "7731": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, I can drink a beer underwater!</p>", "7732": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How do I put this? She's been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part. Or a cat, or a willow.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can't believe she would say that about me.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> If you're gonna cry about it there's tissues in my purse. Unless you got some in yours, big willow.</p>", "7733": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I think you'd be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage I saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend, Lucy, and I didn't get upset at all.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm proud of you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, you should be, 'cause she was looking good.</p>", "7734": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (on the phone) Howie, stop. I can't talk like that. Amy's right here.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (on the phone) Sheldon, stop. For the last time, I will not bring home bed bugs.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> The hotel's nice. There's a pool, a gym, the bar looks like fun.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Aw, I love you, too. If I don't talk to you before you go to sleep, I'll meet you in dreamland.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Good night. No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment bag.</p>", "7735": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Check it out. Mrs. Davis from Human Resources is here. She's probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, great. There go my chances of being sexually harassed.</p>", "7736": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical memory.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, brain lesions are fascinating. Unless they're yours, then they're a drag.\n<strong>Bernadette:</strong> To the advancement of science. <br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And to the sick and dying who make it possible.</p>", "7737": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, it sounds like you're saying that I could do better than Sheldon.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Boy, these drinks are strong. Oh mama, I'm gonna be huggin' the toilet tonight.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, tell me, I want to know what you meant by that.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I just meant that you're not married and your boyfriend's kind of, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And your husband is extremely Howard.</p>", "7738": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I can't believe it. All this time I've been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the worst part is?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That you're having to process your emotional pain without vodka?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No. Yeah.</p>", "7739": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'd like to apologize for being insensitive. And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them are stand-up guys.</p>", "7740": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. It's in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.</p>", "7741": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, fine. Let's say there was a moment.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> There was.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> There wasn't. But even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So nothing.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, not a thing.</br></p>", "7742": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Leonard, I may have gotten you a job.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I have a job.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim.</p>", "7743": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, now, but do you think that's a good idea? You know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, don't discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No one asked you, Uhura.</p>", "7744": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you think?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Great. I've been doing some reading about vehicular safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that's the thing about factoids. They're interesting.</p>", "7745": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know what you're doing. You don't want me going on this research trip because you're afraid to be alone.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not afraid to be alone. On land. On the sea, it would be terrifying. Because of all the drowning.</p>", "7746": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say that's going to stop me.</p>", "7747": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> If you look carefully at Venus, you should be able to see the International Space Station pass by.<br/>\nLucy: Wow. Your friend was actually up there?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said \"My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt\".<br/>\nLucy: Did he take the T-shirt to space?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Nope. It's exactly as lousy as advertised.</p>", "7748": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, listen, do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I thought I said that to you.</p>", "7749": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'll be on a ship in the North Sea.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> On a ship? Aren't they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, he's not gonna be there. He's just sending a team to research his theory.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub.</p>", "7750": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, sweetie, if you're gonna screw things up, it's gonna be while you're here, not while you're away. No. I mean, look, you have to go. It sounds like an amazing opportunity. And I'm just basing that on how much I didn't understand what you said about it.</p>", "7751": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Are you kidding me? How often can you say bon voyage to somebody when they're actually going on a voyage?</p>", "7752": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Anyway, you guys really don't need to make a big deal.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, you're being selfish. We need to give you a proper send-off so we'll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, sweetie, shut up.</p>", "7753": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Ignore him. He's a little nervous 'cause he doesn't think I understand the severity of your social anxiety.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What the? Are you crazy? You can't talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious!</p>", "7754": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So, have you ever spent a long time on a boat before?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah.</p>", "7755": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm proud of you, Leonard. Working out on the North Sea for months, that's really something.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know. As far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe your lifetime. I went to space.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not a competition.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're right, you're right. I'm really proud of you, and I'm gonna miss you when you're gone. And space beats water.</br></p>", "7756": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leonard.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It must've killed you when I went to space.</p>", "7757": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, we\u2019re in the red zone. The white zone is for loading and unloading. We\u2019re breaking the law.</p>", "7758": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, anyway, last night on video chat, I spent like twenty minutes just staring into Lucy's eyes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, that sounds romantic.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It was, until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one of my top three dates of all time.</p>", "7759": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> How's that been working for you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt.</p>", "7760": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So then during the afternoon shift, I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, that's awful.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Not really. My shirt was soaking wet. I got like the biggest tip of my life.</p>", "7761": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Aren't they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, he's not gonna be there. He's just sending a team to research his theory.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub.</p>", "7762": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't worry, officer. They just love each other. We're not smuggling drugs.</p>", "7763": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> See, Howard's just as good a dungeon master as I am.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As good? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four eyes.</p>", "7764": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Burbank Airport, please.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Vegas, here we come.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No husbands, no boyfriends, no rules.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No rules? We're not gonna get drunk and have a six way with the Blue Man Group, are we?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So there are some rules.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Fine. No husbands, no boyfriends, some rules.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Thank you. Vegas!</p>", "7765": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> The ladies are away, the boys will play.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Anything can happen.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's gonna get crazy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Dungeons &amp; Dragons!</p>", "7766": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I got some old underwear I'm gonna throw on stage at the Garth Brooks concert.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm sorry, why old?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> 'Cause last time I saw him, I threw new ones and it got me nothing.</p>", "7767": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've got a brand-new seven piece set of polyhedral dice. Hello, new dice smell.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I've got my helm of lordly might, my boots of speed, and if things get too exciting, my inhaler of asthma.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I got my new bloodthirsty savage warrior who will lay waste to all who stand before him. And I had a sensible salad for lunch, so I can eat all the pizza I want.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Come on, are we gonna sit around chatting like a bunch of teenage girls, or are we gonna play D&amp;D like a bunch of teenage boys who are never gonna have sex with those teenage girls?</p>", "7768": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon master instead of you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, that's nice. But relax, sometimes change is good. You were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock, but you wound up liking him.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, please. Every time the topic of change comes up, you throw Zachary Quinto in my face. I'm upset the mailman has a new haircut, Zachary Quinto. I'm upset that daylight saving time started, Zachary Quinto. I'm upset daylight saving time ended, Zachary Quinto. I'm saying this for the last time, Zachary Quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. So stop using him against me.</p>", "7769": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, Lucy's free after all. See ya.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, hey, hey. You can't leave. We just started.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You're right, I should finish the game. I take my plus-one long sword, stab myself in the face with it. I'm dead. I've got a date with a girl. Bye.</p>", "7770": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You guys enjoy your evening. I'm gonna go before I ruin anybody else's weekend.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah, that's my girl.</br></p>", "7771": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Amy, wait. I know it's not the night you had in mind, but why don't you guys stay and play with us? It'll be fun.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It would? Fun? Okay, three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter, now you want the girls to play D&amp;D? Do you have a drug problem?</p>", "7772": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> A satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like Al Pacino rises from the forest floor and says, (Imitating Al Pacino) \"You're playing D&amp;D. You're playing D&amp;D. This whole apartment is playing D&amp;D.\"</p>", "7773": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, who wants a drink?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now, Penny, we don't consume alcohol during Dungeons &amp; Dragons. It impairs our judgment.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, this isn't alcohol. It's a magic potion that makes me like you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Double potion, please.</p>", "7774": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know what? Give me the dice, I want to roll.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The dungeon master's supposed to roll.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, well Im supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet. Now give it.</p>", "7775": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Fifteen's the point, the point is fifteen. Give the little lady some room. Here it is, coming out. Sixteen! Yes! Oh, please tell me we're playing for money.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, even better than money. You gained experience points.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> More potion, please.</p>", "7776": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, Amy, there's one ogre left. Take him out.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Pretend he's that TSA agent. Come on.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Nineteen. Yes, this is turning out to be even better than Vegas.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, it's not.</p>", "7777": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Lucy?<br/>\nLucy: Hey, long time no see.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You don't know me very well, but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company, it chips away at my masculinity.</p>", "7778": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I don't know about you guys, but I have been through the emotional wringer tonight.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> This may be the potion talking, but you are one fine-ass dungeon master.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, yeah? Well, when we get home, I'm gonna take you on a whole different adventure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, they're talking about sex.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, then I'm out.</p>", "7779": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> The love spell takes effect. When Sheldon looks at Amy, she is the most beautiful half-orc he's ever seen, and he's overcome with a desire to rip her armor off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts. When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks, well, just like Sheldon, 'cause apparently she\u2019s into that.</p>", "7780": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You don't have to come in here and cheer me up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you. Would you go tell everyone else that? Because they sure think otherwise.</p>", "7781": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'll tell you what they think. They think our relationship is a joke.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I don't think our relationship is a joke. I think \"a horse goes into a bar, bartender says, why the long face?\", that's a joke. It's a good one, too, because a horse has a long face.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, my. That's an uncomfortable topic. Amy, before I met you, I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And now?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And now what?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you have any interest now?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have not ruled it out.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Wow. Talk dirty to me.</p>", "7782": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I like you a lot, and that's scary for me. Mostly because you're a proven flight risk.</p>", "7783": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> The interface is pretty simple. You put your horizontal X coordinate here, vertical Y coordinate here. When you're happy with those, you press this button.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Got it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, you'll never guess who I just found online. (A foam missile fires at Sheldon) Hey!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Nice shot.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Eh, his giant head did most of the work.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Very mature. You're lucky I'm out of silly string.</p>", "7784": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. He's still available for parties and events. We should hire him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hire him to do what?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar.</p>", "7785": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didn't I?</p>", "7786": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's happening. Leonard, it's happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're kidding.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you I'd find a tactful way to do that.</br></p>", "7787": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It's very simple. For breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin, but not both. We're watching our weight. Uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Classy dog.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes. Also, don't forget to close the toilet or she'll drink out of it.</p>", "7788": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> (To Cinnamon) I feel for ya. I've got a psychotic mommy, too.</p>", "7789": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, are you in bed?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Me, too.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Great.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't sleep.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I can, so shut up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you're gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.</p>", "7790": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm thinking of wearing a tuxedo.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's not ridiculous. Good night.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you have cufflinks?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah, just as well. Where can you rent a tuxedo at three oclock in the morning?</p>", "7791": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, you two were so cute playing together.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn't wear out her tiny legs.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, that's what I was doing.</p>", "7792": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You know, there were a few moments today when I almost felt like we were a little family.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah. I never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, I felt like maybe someday we could do it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Of course we can. Especially if our babys as calm and quiet as little Cinna Son of a bitch, she's gone.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Where'd she go?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. She didn't leave a note!</p>", "7793": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, I wasn't. You were.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, I wasn't.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes, you were!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, well, you throw like a girl.</p>", "7794": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> It, it's hard to say. I'm, I'm still trying to figure out what, what th, what this is.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Well, there, there really isn't too much to tell. After the TV show was, was canceled, nobody in the scientific world would, uh, would take me seriously. So I was forced to do these, uh, children's parties to, to make a living.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> You, you get bit a lot.</p>", "7795": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Let me see if, if I have this straight. You, you two are, are physicists, and you, and you want me to do a children's science show?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. And if there's time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> You know, I'm a real scientist. I, I have a PhD from Cornell University.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, that's great. Did you bring your puppet?<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> No, no. I, I hate that puppet.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no. How could anybody hate (in an exaggerated Italian accent) Gino the Neutrino? It's nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. (Italian accent) Including the shipping!<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> I'm, I'm awake, right? Th, this is happening?</p>", "7796": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Okay, as, as I put the egg on top, and, and the flame goes out and, and, and the air pressure decreases in, in the flask, what do you think will happen?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I think I know.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's gonna get sucked in. It's going to get sucked in.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, I didn't know.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> See, I'm not a scientist like them.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> I, I figured that out.</p>", "7797": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Look, guys, keep your money. I, I think, uh, I, I think I'm done.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What, well what's wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> No, she, she's the only reason I've, I've stayed this long.</p>", "7798": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Then what is it?<br/><br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> I don't know. I think I'm just, I, I just, I just don't want to be Professor Proton any more.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, how can you say that? Professor Protons the best.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> What, what has it ever gotten me? I mean, I'm, I'm an 83-year-old man who has potatoes in, in his suitcase. Other scientists think, think I'm a joke. And the, the puppeteer who did, who did Gino, well, he also did my wife.</p>", "7799": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didn't have any friends growing up.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> No, I, I get that.</p>", "7800": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But, um, I did have you. And every day at four o'clock, you'd come to my house on Channel 68, and we'd do science together. If it hadn't been for you, well, who knows what would've become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could've wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, it's true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Well, thank, thank you, guys. That, that, that means a lot.</br></p>", "7801": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this'll be the best day ever.</p>", "7802": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Can't believe we lost her. What was I thinking? I'd be a terrible mom.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, maybe with the first one. But kids are like pancakes. The first one's always a throwaway.</p>", "7803": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> (Skype tone) It's Raj. Stay quiet. Hey, bad timing. Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hmm. Interesting. Did they take a walk down Liars' Lane?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> A lane frequented by liars. Like you, you big liar.</p>", "7804": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hang on, you've had her for hours?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes. I picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So you knew she was okay, and you couldn't pick up the phone to tell us?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I, I thought about-<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Don't well me, mister. We've been worried sick. She could have been dead for all we knew. You should be ashamed of yourself.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sorry. I, I just-<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sorry's not good enough. Maybe you need to take some time and think about what you've done. (ends the Skype call)<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Nice guilt trip. You are gonna be an amazing mom!</p>", "7805": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> But I, I do, I do have a favor to, to ask.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Name it.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Well, I'm, I'm booked to do a children's party tomorrow, and, um, frankly I, you know, I, I don't feel up to it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, you're not. You look awful.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Thank you. Anyway, uh, I mean, you know my act better than anybody. I was, I was hoping that maybe, you know, maybe you'd fill in for me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, my. What an honor. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Or a Korean family in Alhambra.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But they'll know I'm not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Sounds great.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, in a way it's like I'm your son.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> What- Whatever.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Father.<br/><strong>Professor Proton:</strong> Sure, what the hell.</p>", "7806": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> No wrapper's gonna tell me what to do, unless it's Jay-Z.</p>", "7807": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why would the Chinese make our DVR record Paul Blart: Mall Cop?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. It's a fat guy on a Segway. That's funny everywhere.</p>", "7808": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Listen to me, if she's writing about your relationship, use it to your advantage. Rig the game.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, that doesn't seem fair.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more than nervous weirdos?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, it's not. I've always thought that was unfair.</p>", "7809": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What's wrong with cute?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It just makes things seem small. It diminishes them.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So you want me to stop calling your little tushie cute?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You can try, but nobody's gonna believe you.</p>", "7810": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, dear. Penny, have you been recording shows on our DVR again?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Answer honestly. This is not a trial. That'll come later.</p>", "7811": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, that's the season two finale. That was quite the cliffhanger. I'm going to re-watch it before season three starts.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> There is no season three. They canceled that show.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, they can't cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> They did.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Dumplings? Don't you understand what's going on here?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> As a rule, no.</p>", "7812": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious. Oh, now I'll never know what happened.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, why don't you make up your own ending?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, I'll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, I'll rub pudding on my gums.</p>", "7813": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Keep reading. What does it say?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, no, I don't know if I should. If she wanted me to know about her blog, she would've told me. It's almost like I'm reading her diary.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's exactly what it's like. Keep reading.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, this is creepy.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rear-view mirror when I put up that camera.</p>", "7814": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> With all the TV Sheldon was talking about, I had the greatest idea ever. It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called Brewbacca's. You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is the perfect show for the two of us. It's got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this. What do you say?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's six thirty in the morning.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I thought you grew up on a farm.</p>", "7815": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, SyFy Network? Yeah, this is your vice president of programming. Now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding Alphas. Yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately. Well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them it's me, and I don't want to answer a lot of questions about if I really am who I say I am, you know? I just, I want this done. No, I am not the person who just called. That man was clearly a cowboy. Yeah, who was plumb concerned about yall canceling his favorite show. Why do they keep hanging up on me?</p>", "7816": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm sorry you're upset. You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.</br></p>", "7817": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay. Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that's nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. I don't care how they end.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, I might be able to help you with this. There's a whole field of behavioral neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, but I just told you, I don't have a problem with closure.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You sure about that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, quite sure. (Amy performs a knocking pattern but stops before completing it. Sheldon finishes it off.) That proves nothing.</p>", "7818": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So take what's in that blog and use it to get her pants off.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldn't you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The key to her heart. That's nice. Were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women, Sir Elton John.</p>", "7819": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I think you'll like the next one better. All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. Well, that's like my high school, too. But instead of a curse, it was crabs.</p>", "7820": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I've come up with a series of exercises to help with your compulsive need for closure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I take issue with the word compulsive.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> All I'm saying is, we live in a world where closure isn't always an op...<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> -tion. Okay. For the sake of argument, let's say I have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?</p>", "7821": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure. Especially since I'm about to win. (Amy wipes the board clean.) But we didn't finish.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Exactly. How does that make you feel?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The same way any normal person would. I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And thats exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.\n<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off.</p>", "7822": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, help me out here. Why does he love this show so much?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, there was action, it was funny. I mean, you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl, but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yippee, it's backwards. I get it.</p>", "7823": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> It's just, he's so passionate about so many different things. I just don't get that way. Do you?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, sure. I'm pretty passionate about science. I remember the first time I looked through a microscope and saw millions of tiny microorganisms. It was like a whole other universe. If I wanted to, I could wipe it out with my thumb like a god.</p>", "7824": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I wish I had some of that fire in my life. I mean, I want to care about things and get excited like you guys.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, there's no reason you cant.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You think?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Absolutely. All we need to do is spend a little time and find something you're passionate about.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ugh, that sounds like a lot of work.</p>", "7825": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, Lucy's coming over. I need some advice.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> However long you think the foreplay should be, triple it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Just tell me which one you think is more manly. This hockey jersey or this football jersey.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. Go with hockey.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Good, black is more slimming. Oh, that's her. I got to go be butch. Toodles.</p>", "7826": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, I was thinking how excited you get about stuff like Buffy or science or which TV remote you and Sheldon should buy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The Harmony One was fine. We didn't need to upgrade to the eleven hundred, which he knows is too big for my hand.</p>", "7827": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke.</p>", "7828": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> While I disagree with the premise of tenure, if they gave it to me, it wouldn't diminish my output. You know, I'm like the sun. Can't turn this off.</p>", "7829": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Born in New Delhi, the third son of an itinerant gynaecologist, I showed early signs of genius. At age five, I discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon.</p>", "7830": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I won't be able to make our date night this Thursday, so, bad news for you.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Well you better have a good excuse this time. Because trimming Q-tips to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense.</br></p>", "7831": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know what you're doing, but I was about to insinuate that I had coitus with Raj's mother for a dollar.</p>", "7832": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> These spring rolls are amazing. Good job, Bernadette.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's the takeout that Sheldon brought.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, well, I'm sure they wouldn't have tasted nearly as good if I hadn't tried your food first.</p>", "7833": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> His quirks just make you love him more. Someone please agree with me.</p>", "7834": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Just seeing that letter freaked him out. And he was already having a tough day, 'cause he accidentally wore my pants to work. I don't know why he was upset. They were bigger on him than me.</p>", "7835": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Now, the first thing we need is a theme. I'm thinking turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm thinking you need a testosterone patch.</p>", "7836": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.</p>", "7837": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It was a map leading to the lost treasure of the famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Nice try. That's the plot for Goonies.</p>", "7838": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I would like to change mine. The pirate's name was Peg-Leg Antoine. Now it's completely different from Goonies.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, it's not.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't.</p>", "7839": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Excuse me, I\u2019m meeting a girl here. It\u2019s kind of our first date.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> In a library?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> She and I are both a little awkward in social situations, so this seemed like a good idea.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> People say I\u2019m a little awkward, too.</p>", "7840": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> (To Lucy, after speaking to Raj) You can do better!</p>", "7841": "<p><strong>Bert:</strong> May I join you?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, you can\u2019t join us. Just go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from.</p>", "7842": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names. Like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I supposed there is a history for professional women using their initials so as not to be pre-judged. Harry Potter's J.K. Rowling, Star Trek's D.C. Fontana.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Van Nuys pole dancer D.D. Melons.</p>", "7843": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Guys, please don't make this a school project where I'm the smartest kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We're not. This time you're the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So, you think I'm one of the smarter kids?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, you're a tool I was using to make my point.</p>", "7844": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Thanks again for letting me crash girls' night.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you kidding? You brought fancy wine and made fondue. I've slept with guys for less.<br/>\nIt's a joke. Based on real events.</p>", "7845": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So blow off work and go on a weekday.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Hooky? I've never played hooky in my life. My mom said that's how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music.</br></p>", "7846": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's nice of your old school to let us try out our science talk on some female students.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, they're actually pretty excited. I'm their most famous alum. If you don't count the serial killer who ate all those prostitutes.</p>", "7847": "<p><strong>Girl:</strong> So you just flew around? That's kind of like my uncle. He's a flight attendant.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, I'm an American hero. Your uncle brings people nuts, okay?</p>", "7848": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I never wanted to play the cello. How do you meet girls playing the cello? Hey, you want to come over to my house and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?</p>", "7849": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's wrong?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera. You know, like a real conversation. It's something we work on in my acting class.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Interesting. A few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic. Perhaps that's not the compliment it sounds like.</p>", "7850": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Let's try it again, and maybe this time, you could work on your body language a bit. You know, when you're all hunched like that, you're shutting the audience out, but when you're relaxed and open, you're inviting them in.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Right. And which one do I want?</p>", "7851": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm telling you, something is wrong. I can always feel it when Raj is in trouble.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Geez, how close were you guys before we got married?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't look under that rock.</p>", "7852": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> We were worried about you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, just because I've stopped going to work and answering my phone, you think something bad has happened. Maybe something good happened.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Did something good happen?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Of course not. Nothing good ever happens.</p>", "7853": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, you can't stay in your apartment for the rest of your life.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why not? With online shopping and overnight delivery, I can get anything I want. Look, I just ordered a case of Dinty Moore beef stew and two live lobsters on Amazon.</p>", "7854": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> He's just decided he's never leaving his apartment again.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, brilliant. I've been itching to pull that trigger.</p>", "7855": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> He's upset because he can't get anywhere with women.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would it help if I gave him some pointers?<br/>\nI'm just funnin' ya.</p>", "7856": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Raj is a proud, passionate man. If you go running out on him again, you're only gonna get like three of four more chances before you are history.</p>", "7857": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, Amy, what's going on with your addiction study?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sadly, I'm no longer associated wtih that project.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why? What happened.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Typical bureaucratic nonsense. You can get animals addicted to a harmful substance, you can dissect their brains, but you throw their own faeces back at them and suddenly you're unprofessional.</p>", "7858": "<p><strong>Lucy:</strong> I'm kind of broken.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's great. I'm broken, too.<br/><strong>Lucy:</strong> Oh, no you're not.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, I totally am. If it wasn't for this beer, I couldn't even talk to you right now. I'm a wreck. There are many things seriously wrong with me. And not quirks, either. Like diagnosable psychological problems. Maybe brain damage.<br/><strong>Lucy:</strong> Well how do I know you're not just saying that?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Go out with me on one date. I promise you, you'll see.</p>", "7859": "<p><strong><strong>Sheldon:</strong></strong> Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper presents Fun with Flags. My apologies that this episode is coming late. I did shoot one last week in honor of Black History month, but I was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of George Washington Carver could be considered \"wildly racist\".</p>", "7860": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Smells ripe in here. You can kinda feel it in your eyes.</p>", "7861": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> *knock*.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, what's up?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ummmm.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You want me to close the door so you can do your knocking thing?</br></p>", "7862": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> He's just decided that he'll never leave his apartment ever again.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, good, I've been itching to pull that trigger.<br/></p>", "7863": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, this time it's going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja. You don't see it coming and then, bam, romance. Watch out! Hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, sometimes I think I've made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do something like that.</p>", "7864": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Bernie's a little cranky since she's been working, like, seventeen hours a day. And I've got a lot on my plate, too, because I've been busting my tail playing Assassin's Creed.</p>", "7865": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Everything okay?</p>", "7866": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Screw you, Sheldon. You are the most annoying person I have ever met.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What? I'm annoying? You criticize my behavior all the time. Sheldon, don't talk about your bowel movements over breakfast. Sheldon, when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral, don't yawn and point at your watch. Sheldon, don't throw away my shirts 'cause you think they're ugly. You're impossible.</p>", "7867": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> They spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Is there a good anal leakage?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Anyway, it was Bernie's idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Way to make lemonade. You know, from around the corner where fudge is made.</p>", "7868": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> My mom's been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Dumped her? What, did he use a forklift? Sorry. There's nothing funny about morbid obesity.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She's huge. It was funny.</p>", "7869": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule. He would just go whenever the mood struck him.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Like a dog boy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Exactly.</p>", "7870": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm not going anywhere. Penny and I are very happy living together. Isn't that right?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's like the happiness won't ever leave the apartment.</p>", "7871": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know why I avoided the Harry Potter books for so long. These are great. I just started number six.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's a good one. Dumbledore dies in that one. Yeah, I know, I didn't see it coming, either.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why would you say that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You brought up the subject. I contributed an interesting fact on that subject. It's called the art of conversation. Okay, your turn.</p>", "7872": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why would you say that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You brought up the subject. I contributed an interesting fact on that subject. It's called the art of conversation. Okay, your turn.</p>", "7873": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What? I'm annoying? You criticize my behavior all the time. Sheldon, don't talk about your bowel movements over breakfast. Sheldon, when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral, don't yawn and point at your watch. Sheldon, don't throw away my shirts 'cause you think they're ugly. You're impossible.</p>", "7874": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't have to put up with this.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Actually, I have your signature on a Roommate Agreement that says you do.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Here's what I think of your Roommate Agreement.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You pick that up right now.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Roommate Agreement, Section 27, Paragraph 5: \"The Roommate Agreement, like the American flag, cannot touch the ground.\"</p>", "7875": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Great. Come on in.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> What, you don't say thank you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's my suitcase. I lent it to you two years ago.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, then, I should tell you I broke the wheel and the handle.</br></p>", "7876": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Dude, I'm a single man. Saturday night is my party night.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really? What do you got going on?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know. Maybe drive down to Hollywood, hit a few hot spots, see if I can get lucky.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, tell me if this sounds familiar. You pay fifteen dollars to park, you stand on the pavement for an hour until you break down and give the bouncer twenty bucks to let you in. You push your way to the bar, where you drink an eighteen dollar cosmopolitan, then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together. Your children, grandchildren. Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy who claims he wrote Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Then you give up on anyone ever loving you, go to Marie Callenders, buy a pie and eat it in your car in the parking lot.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong>What time should I be at your mother's?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I told her around seven.</p>", "7877": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being I have ever met.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. Like Bert and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.</p>", "7878": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> My point is, as much as I want to live with you, I can't do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, you know what they say, if it ain't broke...</p>", "7879": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? I take a lot of medicine.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, please let some of it be Xanax.</p>", "7880": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I've had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you've had removed from your body over the years. Didn't know you could have a cyst inside another cyst.<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> The doctor said they were like Russian nesting dolls.</p>", "7881": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure. That's Leonard's.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (writing down) Children's toy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> One Star Trek: The Next Generation phaser. That's Leonard's.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (writing down) Children's toy.</p>", "7882": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, good buddy. So, uh, I was just talking to Amy, and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is that so?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. All is forgiven, so come back home. I'll make you some soy hot chocolate, and then I'll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy.</p>", "7883": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Cut to the chase, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. Amy's decided she wants to move in with me, so I need you to come back home, you lovable scamp. (rubbing Leonard's head) That's a lot of product.</p>", "7884": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, home wrecker.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What did I do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You gave Leonard somewhere to go. Thanks to you, Amy's out buying his and hers bath towels. Like I'd ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it.</p>", "7885": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I love him. This is just happening too fast.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You think this is fast? It's just a matter of time before I see Amy's leg stubble in my shower.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, and I've seen those legs. You might want to get some Drano.</p>", "7886": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You're still at my mother's?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm trapped. My clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys. I think they might be in her bra, because she jingles when she walks. What do I do?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, you wanted a woman in your life. Now you got one.</p>", "7887": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's Penny's fault.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She doesn't want to live with Leonard, so he has to come live here again. She's the snake in our garden. She's the reason we can't be happy.</p>", "7888": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A hush falls over the crowd as Cooper studies the board. He makes his move. He's dividing both sides by I. He's adding back the coefficient. He has a value for P. He's plugging that back in. He takes the derivative, and he solves the equation. The crowd goes wild. Nobel! Nobel!</p>", "7889": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's ridiculous. I am one of the great minds of our generation. I work on a level so rarefied you couldn't even imagine it. I said stop looking at my train!</p>", "7890": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, I'm not dark chocolate. I'm melt-in-your-mouth caramel.</p>", "7891": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I can't believe I wasted all that money.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aw, and my girlfriend wouldn't let me get one. Look at my face. Do I look smug? I feel smug.</br></p>", "7892": "<p><strong>Kripke:</strong> You have some brilliant insights here, but if we're gonna make this work, you need to buckle down and focus.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll do what I can. But it's not going to be easy, because when I'm with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together, boy howdy, is it magic.</p>", "7893": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's so cute. I didn't think there could be a smaller version of you.</p>", "7894": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, I don't understand. Why didn't you just tell Kripke the truth?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because the truth made my look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. Anyway, if Kripke asks, tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive.</p>", "7895": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is my coitus whimsically inventive?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That is what I write on the bathroom walls. For a whimsically inventive time, call Leonard Hofstadter.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know you're joking, but I'd be okay with that.</p>", "7896": "<p><strong>Kripke:</strong> Was she naked or was she wearing lingerie?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I didn't notice.<br/><strong>Kripke:</strong> How could you not notice?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> i was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.<br/><strong>Kripke:</strong> Ah, you're killing me, Cooper!</p>", "7897": "<p><strong>Kripke:</strong> You guys ever use any toys?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Toys? I do have a model rocket next to my bed.<br/><strong>Kripke:</strong> A rocket? You're a freak! I love it!</p>", "7898": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, okay, great. Now, I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman, instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, you can suck it in a little bit.</p>", "7899": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Damn, you've got more makeup than I do. You've got better makeup than I do. Yeah, I'm borrowing this.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, hey, hey. This is my Comic-Con makeup. I love you, but there are some things a man doesn't share with his girlfriend.</p>", "7900": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That was San Diego Comic-Con. This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Is that better?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, it's a lot smaller. It's more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So to answer your question, no, it's not better.</p>", "7901": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well then why are you going?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's a comic book convention. You know, it's like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one's still pretty good.</p>", "7902": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, this is the best. You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday, you got a problem. You do it on the weekend, you got brunch.</p>", "7903": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon doesn't believe in brunch. He can't stand being at a table where one person's having an omelette and another person's having a sandwich.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's not exhausting at all.</p>", "7904": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, will you steam my uniform next?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Interesting. Do you recall this conversation? Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer? No, Sheldon, we don't need a steamer. Looks like that rumpled chicken's come home to roost.</p>", "7905": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Great idea. I haven't had a carbohydrate in two weeks. These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before I eat a pretzel and they're gone.</p>", "7906": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's a wise policy. I once borrowed my sister's makeup for a costume contest. Got a terrible case of pinkeye. But luckily, I was going as a zombie. I won second place.</p>", "7907": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Thor is a god. The hammer is his. Only he can use it. It's like Sheldon and his toothbrush. Or his thin, beckoning lips.</p>", "7908": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's cute how excited they are. You should have seen Howard sewing his costume all week for the convention.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> When did Howard learn to sew?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> When he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his mom's pants out.</br></p>", "7909": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I wish my mom was here. We could all hang out in her shadow.</p>", "7910": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think you should turn on the GPS.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It is on.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But the turn-by-turn voice option isn't on. I know I'd feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option. I love the turn-by-turn voice option.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Has it really only been ten miles?</p>", "7911": "<p>(The girls enter Stuart's comic book store)<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why are they staring?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Who cares? Just soak it in. Hello, boys.</p>", "7912": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, uh, let's see. You've got your basic clean-cut good guys, Superman, Spider-Man, Captain America. Then you have your darker anti-heroes, your Batman, your Wolverine, Punisher.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Ooh, I do love a bad boy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.</p>", "7913": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> If I were you, I'd go for Fables number one. The artwork is sophisticated, it's intelligently written, and it doesn't objectify or stereotype women.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, Thor! He's hot.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Yeah, he kind of is.</p>", "7914": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So what's our first pose going to be?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I say we begin with a classic Star Trek fight scene.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'll set the timer.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mr. Data's weapon is his mind. I'm wielding it.</p>", "7915": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, my God. Leonard, someone's stealing your car!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What? Hey, hey! Come back here!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Stop!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Stealing is against the law!</p>", "7916": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'll call 911. What, oh, no, my phone is in my other pants.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, so is mine.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mine, too. Anybody got any ideas?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nope. The only thing left to do now is assign blame. (To Raj) Nice going.</p>", "7917": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, let's just start walking. There's got to be a gas station or something nearby.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What, you think just because you're wearing a captain's uniform, you're in charge?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right.</p>", "7918": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor while Thor is holding the hammer?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yeah?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Then by the transitive property of picking things up, Hulk picked up the hammer.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No. Hulk picked up Thor, Thor picked up the hammer.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, hang on. If I go to a bar and pick up a guy, and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together, did I pick up the girl?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Did that ever happen?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?</p>", "7919": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I must say, Leonard, when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga, I was skeptical.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can't blame you. Tiny Twister was a complete bust.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I was wrong. The looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice. I've never felt so alive.</p>", "7920": "<p>Alex: Hey, Leonard.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey. Just playing a little Giant Jenga here.<br/>\nAlex: Oh, I know, I'm the one who had to buy him the helmet.</br></p>", "7921": "<p>Alex: So, do you have any plans this weekend?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, most of Saturday's gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we're done.</p>", "7922": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon's assistant asked me on a date last night.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How could you do that to me? You know I've been working it with Alex for weeks.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Working it? You can't even talk to her.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I talk with my eyes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You look like my little cousin when he's dropping one in his diaper.</p>", "7923": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> She knows I have a girlfriend. It's so weird.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, my God. You're loving this.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> To my bones. I mean, I'm not gonna do anything about it. I love Penny. It's just nice to have a young, attractive woman sniffing around the goods.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I both hate you and want to be you. This is Ryan Gosling all over again.</p>", "7924": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you guys think I should do?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny, I provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good.</p>", "7925": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm gonna kill her.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Im sure you've got nothing to worry about. Leonard would never cheat on you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> She's right. But say the word, I got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose. One of them could end up in the backseat of her car. Or her shower.</p>", "7926": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, Alex is your employee. If she's doing something that's making Leonard uncomfortable, you should talk to her.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no, he's not uncomfortable at all. No, he's loving it. Yeah, he's strutting around like he's five-foot-six.</p>", "7927": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Talk to her? That's all you've got? With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies, I really expected more. Give me back the T-shirts.</p>", "7928": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Alex, check my schedule. What does my afternoon look like?<br/>\nAlex: I think it's pretty wide open. Oh, wait. Here's something at four o'clock. \"Give Alex a talking to\"?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that snuck up on us, didn't it?</p>", "7929": "<p>Alex: Is there a problem?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let's not call it a problem. Let's call it an opportunity. To solve a serious problem.</p>", "7930": "<p>Alex: This conversation is making me uncomfortable.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, you and me both, sister. Now, please understand, I don't hold you responsible for your behavior because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, you're a slave to your desire to reproduce. But during the work day, when you feel possessed by amorous intent, may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases? Let's see here. Oh, yes. Check out this oozy doozy.<br/>\nAlex: I have to go.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So does this fellow, but he can't without it burning like hot soup.</p>", "7931": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, pretty lady.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, you seem extra happy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, I guess I am.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Any particular reason why?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know, just having a good day. This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so I got to listen to the radio. That was pretty crazy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mm-hmm. Anything else?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mm. I found this quiz online called \"Which Star Trek Character Are You?\" and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.</p>", "7932": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> And the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, and who's that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you mean?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I just didn't know if you meant me or Alex.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Um, why would I mean Alex?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Don't play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm missing something.</p>", "7933": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did you say something to Penny about Alex?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why would you do that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I needed advice about a woman. I would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it's that you cant tell a uterus from a unicycle.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good to know. Yeah, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies.</p>", "7934": "<p>Ms. Davis: I called you in today because your assistant Alex Jensen has lodged a complaint against you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So I've been told. But I can't understand what she has to complain about. I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history. There's string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that's for anyone. Yeah, and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.<br/>\nMs. Davis: Cancel my next appointment. This is gonna take a while.</p>", "7935": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, you, Im just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman's menstrual cycle...<br>\nMs. Davis: Woah! You can't talk about that, either, Dr. Cooper. Your language is entirely inappropriate, and Im gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now.</br></p>", "7936": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't see why I'm the one being persecuted here. Dr. Hofstadter, he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen. You know, and Howard Wolowitz, he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot. Oh, and at the office Christmas party, I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as Brown Sugar.<br/>\nMs. Davis: Hofstadter. Wolowitz. And the last one was Rajesh Koothrappali?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. No, yeah, but in his defense, that wasn't racist. He's also brown.</p>", "7937": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't care about Alex. Fine, I care. Okay, I hate that bitch. But what really hurt is that you liked it so much. I mean, do I need to be worried?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Of course not. No. Why?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Because, she is pretty and smart, and when you talk about work, she doesn't have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.</p>", "7938": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hang on. Are you feeling insecure? Because that's my thing, and if you take it away, I don't know what I'm bringing to this relationship.</p>", "7939": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come here. Tell you a secret?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What's that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> With all these women chasing me, I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Can I tell you a secret?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Keep talking about Captain Kirk, and we're all gonna stop.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (impersonating William Shatner) Message received.</p>", "7940": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Do you really think you should be drinking right now?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. Seek professional help?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I did. The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.</p>", "7941": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Weird. Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow. (He turns to his dog, licking her butt.) Will you stop licking your ass for two minutes, I have a problem here!</p>", "7942": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Relax. Everything's gonna be fine. Before I met Bernadette I was in here every other day. Uh, little tip, turn off your I Like Big Butts ring tone before you go in.</p>", "7943": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It has been pointed out to me that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive, and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology.<br/>\nAlex: Thank you, Dr. Cooper.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn't happen in the future.<br/>\nAlex: Okay.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah. Now, unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this, so, um, I'm gonna need you to take it for me. Oh, and, uh, you'd better ace it, they're pretty mad.</p>", "7944": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, come with me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Where are we going?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> To my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses. And maybe the boots.</p>", "7945": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep? Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say, it's probably pure gold. So I started recording it all, and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours of what I like to call Sheldon After Dark.</p>", "7946": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that's not acceptable. I mean, I'm her boss. She needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm androgynous?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, please. look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips.</p>", "7947": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. In the past, I've reached out to each of you individually, but I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group. Which, as you can see from your commemorative t-shirts, I have dubbed Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies.</p>", "7948": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Anyway, despite the fact he has a girlfriend, Shilly-Shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's your assistant Alex, isn't it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, no, no. This is Tondelaya della Ventimiglia.</p>", "7949": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, look. It's not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya. It is really about her boss, who doesn't quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice. Which is surprising because Dr. Einstein von Brainstorm, he's usually pretty smart about these things.</p>", "7950": "<p><strong>Ms. Davis:</strong> Well, according to Ms. Jensen, you said that she was a slave to her biological urges and called her an egg salad sandwich. I don't even know what that means, but I'm gonna go ahead and tell you you can't say it.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I see the confusion here. No, no. Alex thought I was singling her out. No, I meant that all woman are slaves to their biological urges, you know? Even you. You're a slave.</br></p>", "7951": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Howard built a sex robot.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That is not true. All I did was build a robot.<br/><strong>Ms. Davis:</strong> Did it have six breasts?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm sorry, I'm a feminist, I don't notice things like how many breasts a robot has.</p>", "7952": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I came to file a complaint. Somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.<br/><strong>Ms. Davis:</strong> And who was that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You, you dirty birdie. I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized I'm deeply offended. Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms.</p>", "7953": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if you're menstruating. And based on your behavior, I don't have to.</p>", "7954": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay. Well, a couple of things. Don't tell them I come from money. I want them to love me for me. They must be insanely hot. Like nines or tens.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Nines or tens?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, an eight is acceptable if she's willing to bring another eight to the hot tub.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Bottom line, you'll take any woman who'll have you, right?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> In a New Delhi minute.</p>", "7955": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I grew up in a house full of crazy academics. Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. And in the morning, you could tell he'd been there because the paper would be graded.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No wonder you love Christmas. That sounds amazing.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It wasn't amazing. I got a C- four years in a row.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I'm familiar with your work. C-minus was your gift.</p>", "7956": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You think that's bad? In college, I passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on.</p>", "7957": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, now holding sides of hearth in position, lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look at that! I built a fireplace with my own two hands.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're so butch.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aw, I got a little paper cut.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Of course you did. Your hands are softer than veal.</p>", "7958": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, before I forget, Saturday I'm planning a little Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? That's how you're gonna spend your Saturday night?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, come on, I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, you poor thing. Is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you getting in the way of your board games?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Little bit, yeah.</p>", "7959": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, great! I've always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, oh, Im sorry. I should've mentioned this earlier. You're not invited.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, from time to time, we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> By rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, like a bunch of savages.</p>", "7960": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Saturday night? But I've been working late all week. That was gonna be our night.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But I have to go. We play as a group. If I'm not there, then everyone will blame you. They'll be all, Bernadette ruined everything. She's the worst. So, you see? I have to play Dungeons and Dragons for the marriage.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're an idiot.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm your idiot. Forever!</p>", "7961": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, whats the plan? Are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson by getting stinking drunk, luring strange men into the bathroom, and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Geez, who's Forever 63 now?</p>", "7962": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Can we get another bottle of champagne for the table? Don't worry. It's my treat.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Thanks.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, you should come to girls' night more often. And not just because if you weren't here, this would be a can of Pabst.</p>", "7963": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> My pleasure, nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady. Just ask my dog. My vet says if I give her any more foie gras, she's going to die of gout.</p>", "7964": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, let's help Raj meet a girl tonight.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, no, no, I'm fine.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, wait, are we talking one-night stand or do we want to get him into a relationship?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Let's get him laid!</p>", "7965": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I open the chest.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's locked, but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> That's not good. My character and I both have claustrophobia.</br></p>", "7966": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> That was amazing, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> How did you know that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It was simple. I combined a well-known historical fact about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents, Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop, singing Christmas carols while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, continuing our quest.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait. There's still four more verses. You don't sing a song and not finish it.<br/>\nHither, page, and stand by me, if thou know'st it, telling. Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling? Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost...</p>", "7967": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Looks like hes doing pretty good.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Of course he is. Look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend. Shes angry, shes drunk, and her favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I mean that is some low-hanging fruit.</p>", "7968": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, how'd it go?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Great. I bought her a couple of drinks, and she gave me her e-mail address.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Jennifer at not-even-if-you-were-the-last-guy-on-earth-dot-loser.</p>", "7969": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Why cant I find someone? I'm smart, I've got a cool job, and my naturally bronzed complexion means I can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can't.</p>", "7970": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm always attracted to women I can't have. I do it all the time. I did the same thing with the two of you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> The two of them? I don't understand.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, uh, there was a time when I had a thing for Penny, and I thought she was into me, too, because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me. But apparently I misread those signals.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And you liked Bernadette also?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That was before Penny. I make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends' girlfriends at a time. I'm very old-fashioned that way.</p>", "7971": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So at, uh, some point, you probably had a thing for me, too.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, not really.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Not that I can think of.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Think harder.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Nope. I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. Or in this case, doesn't, I mean, at all.</p>", "7972": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Sometimes I get so lonely, I sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then I put it in my right hand and pretend I\u2019m holding hands with another person.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I do that, too. Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel. And I let it.</p>", "7973": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I take out my skeleton key and run to Santa to unchain him.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wait, what are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You can't talk, you're paralyzed. I get right up in Santa's big, fat face and say, well, well, well, jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again. Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas, when I was five years old, isn't that right?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, okay.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas. And I told you, my Pop-Pop, because that was the year my grandfather died. I missed him and I wanted him back.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> This is weird, right?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Pop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science. But you didn't bring him back, did you? No, instead, I got Lincoln Logs. Well, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs, but Pop-Pop ain't one of 'em. And now you're here asking me for something, to save you. Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle, but today's not your day. I'm leaving you here to rot, and I hope the ogres feast on your bones. I take the skeleton key, and I toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly.</p>", "7974": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay. So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santa\u2019s dead, and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend.</p>", "7975": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit that Spider-Man, Spider-Man does whatever a spider can.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, so?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can think of many things Spider-Man can't do that a spider can. One, crawl in your ear and die. Two, legally leave Guatemala without a passport. Three, have sex with a spider.</p>", "7976": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, you like to fish?<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sure. I can hear it in your voice.<br/><strong>Mrs. Rostenkowski:</strong> Oh, if he didn't like it, he wouldn't go.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, I hadn't thought of that.</p>", "7977": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm no expert, but I think the hook has to go through the worm.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine. Sorry, Mr. Worm. Sherm. Sherm the Worm.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, don't name him. Just jab a hook in his face.</p>", "7978": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> My dad was an anthropologist. The only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of a Etruscan boy. I hated that kid.</p>", "7979": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Can we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's heebie-jeebies.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic.</p>", "7980": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The theme, movies that killed their franchises.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh. Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous. I mean, you know a movie's bad when my home-girl Sandy B can't save it.</br></p>", "7981": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know what I like to do when I'm forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station? I bring up an interesting topic, like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thanks, Sheldon. I'll try that with my father-in-law.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, you can't use that one. That's mine.</p>", "7982": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker. Uh, despite popular lore, there is no place in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the center of the earth and come up in China.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Great, thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Actually, you can't have that one either. It's too good. Sorry.</p>", "7983": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I think I'm too sick to go to the funeral.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're sick? You poor kid. Well, see ya.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, aren't you gonna take care of me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Me? No. No, I'm not that kind of doctor.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no, I see the confusion. No, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I'm ill. When you're feeling better, you'll think that's funny.</p>", "7984": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> How's that dinner coming?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I just put it in. It's gonna be a while.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I like rare chicken. Let's do this.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You could die.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (To Mike) Death by chicken. That's a pretty fowl way to go.</p>", "7985": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took that trip to the Grand Canyon. How was it?<br/>\nMrs. Rostenkowski: It was good.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Had no idea you were the chatty one.</p>", "7986": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> 102.2. Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It's like you're not even trying to get better.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, you don't get over the flu in half an hour.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, not with that attitude.</p>", "7987": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How can you sleep? I'm not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You, you want to rub something on my chest?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. All over it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Maybe we should start with that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now you're being a responsible patient. Now, you may notice some tingling.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, I'm counting on it.</p>", "7988": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, Dad, maybe you could take Howard fishing sometime. Give you guys a chance to get to know each other better.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, no. We know each other well enough. He's been talking my ear off all night.</p>", "7989": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I've never even been fishing. This is gonna be a disaster.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> If you don't want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over? I'll give you a hint. You can see them here, here and here.</p>", "7990": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Step one, worms.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Ew!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, right there, \"ew\" is one of the things you're not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. It's right up there with icky and get it away. Now pick one up.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're gonna have to do it when you're fishing.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What are you waiting for?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know, for them to die of natural causes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.</p>", "7991": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (reading) And the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. But, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. The end.</p>", "7992": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How's the poor thing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I'm hanging in there. Thanks for asking.</p>", "7993": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, I'm going to draw you a soothing bath. Where's your bath thermometer?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't have a bath thermometer.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. Then I'm going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.</p>", "7994": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, okay, here's the deal. I don't need your medicine. I'm not sick.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't understand.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I got better two days ago. It's just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So you've just been lying to him?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> See the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.</p>", "7995": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored, I'd put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice skating.</p>", "7996": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favor.</p>", "7997": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behavior in the future.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> I suppose that's fair. What do you suggest?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In a perfect world, I'd lock you in a stockade in the public square. That probably requires a permit.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn't kill a man.</br></p>", "7998": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So, what do we do now? They expect us to go away for the weekend.<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> Ah. There's an Indian casino near Palm Springs. You know how to shoot craps?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, but I'm not a stranger to dice games. I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion.<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> Mazel tov. I'll teach you how to play.</p>", "7999": "<p><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> Hold up. Bless us, O Lord for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord. Amen.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Took the words right out of my mouth.</p>", "8000": "<p><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> That's what you're wearing?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No good? The guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear.<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> Maybe in cartoons.</p>", "8001": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Howard did go to the International Space Station.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, that was five weeks ago. How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?</p>", "8002": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine, I'm taking your diploma.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Go ahead. That's the only doctorate you'll ever get.</p>", "8003": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I guess this is what we get for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males. At some point, they're bound to lock horns.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at Comic-Con?</p>", "8004": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Give me back my parking space.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You don't need a parking space. You don't have a car.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You don't need an Iron Man helmet. You're not Iron Man.</p>", "8005": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, we appear to have reached an impasse. And you know, I have to say, I thought you'd be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk.</p>", "8006": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Keep a lookout. This place is swarming with campus security. They will not hesitate to scold us.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Freaking pigs.</p>", "8007": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, Howard, thank you. It's quite a gesture on your part. You've shown yourself to be the bigger man.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Which I found totally unacceptable. I must be the bigger man. Therefore, you may use my spot until such time as I learn to drive or get a Batmobile.</p>", "8008": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A naked man sat on it. Now, here's my concern, his diet is rich in fatty deli meats. What tests do you have to detect lipid residue?<br/><strong>Store owner:</strong> Lipid what?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Lipid residue. An anal autograph. A colon calling card, if you will.</p>", "8009": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What are you drawing over there?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's a hypothetical containment field for a Frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, you silly doodlebug.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard. You can block it with a Frisbee. Calm down.</p>", "8010": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Ooh, this is exciting. Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Right, the case of who murdered three Saturday nights of my life?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Colonel Koothrappali in the kitchen with the olive spread.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It was tapenade and you guys suck.</br></p>", "8011": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Who are you talking to?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, just this guy I met at school.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> oh, great. We're still dating, right?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Relax. He's just a friend. We're doing an oral report together. He's really nice.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sorry, what was that? I had a little stroke after oral.</p>", "8012": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, he just moved here from London, okay? He doesn't really know anybody.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, good, an English accent, the sexiest accent you can have.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, that's not true. There's French, there's Italian. No, you're right, it's the best.</p>", "8013": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, he's not doing twenty-minute abs, because if he were, he would have better abs.</p>", "8014": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> He is kind of a weirdo. Maybe he's got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there. Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Howard, please, you can't treat the man differently just because he's disabled. That's not okay.</p>", "8015": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I don't know. I mean, statistically speaking, I'm sure you have something to worry about.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you mean?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, if we assume your looks are average, right off the bat fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. That's 1.5 billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, yeah, but this isn't just about looks. I'm way above average in a lot of other things.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not height, vision, athleticism or ability to digest dairy products.</p>", "8016": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not saying you don't have attractive qualities. Your choice of friends is impeccable, you're a good sleeper, and last but not least, you buy the grapes I like. You're a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes.</p>", "8017": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> When I was starting to do magic in junior high, I thought I could be an escape artist like Harry Houdini.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How did that work out?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Pretty good. I managed to escape friends, popularity, and every party thrown in a twelve mile radius.</p>", "8018": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> He's always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's paprika.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really? Well, okay, one mystery solved.</p>", "8019": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You, uh, moving in to the apartment on the fifth floor?<br/><strong>Cole:</strong> No, I was just visiting a friend.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, cool. The cute blond on four?<br/><strong>Cole:</strong> Yeah, you know her?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I see her around. I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude.<br/><strong>Cole:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. He's ganged up.<br/><strong>Cole:</strong> She told me he's a scientist.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's the name of his gang. The Scientists. They're crazy.<br/><strong>Cole:</strong> Well, thanks for the tip.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No problem, brother. Stay frosty.</p>", "8020": "<p><strong>Alex:</strong> Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, Alex, call me Leonard. Dr. Hofstadter is my father. And my mother. And my sister. And our cat. Although I'm pretty sure Dr. Boots Hofstadter's degree was honorary.</p>", "8021": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Forty-three. What is forty-three? Besides my mom's neck size.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's the atomic number for technetium.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That stuff's radioactive.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Do you think he's building a bomb?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It took him two years to put together that Lego Death Star. I'm not worried.</p>", "8022": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, shouldn't you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, I'm sorry.</p>", "8023": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's hard sometimes. Everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if I'm standing right there. And they're all taller than me. Why is everyone taller than me? You know what, this is all in my head. It's my problem, not yours.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard, why do you always do this? Listen to me, you're the one I'm with. You know I love you. So will you please relax, because you're driving me crazy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know that's the first time you ever said you love me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We're just supposed to pretend it's not a big deal?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's exactly what we're gonna do, because you're about to make me cry. And we both know if I start crying, you're gonna start crying.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're right, I should go.</p>", "8024": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> That's good quality video.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It better be. It's the same camera for the Mars rover.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How did you get your hands on that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Million dollar camera. Ten dollar lock.</p>", "8025": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Before we get started, I'd like to announce the winner of our design your own flag competition. But I can't. The only entry was from GameyGamer75, and I know that was a jpeg of your buttocks.</p>", "8026": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now this week we have a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help me, I'm pleased to introduce Internet personality, former star of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and the only guy I know lucky enough to be immortalized in one sixteenth scale. Set phasers to fun for my friend, Wil Wheaton.</p>", "8027": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I'm happy to be here.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Cut.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's wrong?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sorry, Sheldon, you were brilliant as always. Wil, that was a little wooden.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Wooden?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Don\u2019t worry, it wasn't terrible. Just, this time, try to say it the way people sound.</br></p>", "8028": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Listen, Sheldon, I'm really happy to do this for you, but not if she's gonna be a huge pain in the ass the whole time.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You gonna let him speak to me like that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, you're my girlfriend and I don't want you to be upset. Then again, Wil Wheaton's my friend and I don't want him to be upset. Hmm, this is a sticky wicket. (To Wil) What do you think?</p>", "8029": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Every time we eat dinner here, your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't take it personally. She likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.</p>", "8030": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You ready to go?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't understand why you keep your stuff here when there's plenty of room at home.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What are you talking about? All I have here is a few sweaters, books, bank stuff, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer. Ooh, there's my plaid dickie. Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents. Can you believe it?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> 50 cents sounds right.</p>", "8031": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, look who's out after dark, like a big boy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton. Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I thought you had plans with Amy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I did, but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S. She got huffy and left, then Wil and I headed out to dinner. That place really did remind me of my hometown. Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.</p>", "8032": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've been thinking about what happened, and I hope this gift will make things better.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Star Trek DVDs? Why would I want this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> First of all, you're welcome. And furthermore, not being familiar with Wil Wheaton's body of work, there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure. Get ready for 130 hours of I told you so. (Amy returns the DVDs and slams the door) Fine. I'll just tell you what happens. Episode one, Encounter at Farpoint. Fade in. The new Enterprise heads out on its maiden voyage to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV. Enter Wesley Crusher, played by my buddy ... (Amy opens the door, grabs the DVDs, and slams the door again) She's hooked.</p>", "8033": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Get ready for a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help us, I\u2019m pleased to introduce a special guest, surprisingly, it only took gas money and the promise of free food to get him here, Mr. LeVar Burton.<br/><strong>LeVar Burton:</strong> Hey, Sheldon, it's a pleasure to be here. Well, we've got some interesting flags for-<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Cut. Yikes, this guy is worse than Wil Wheaton.</p>", "8034": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I have no reason to ... \"B\" mad at you. Minus.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wow.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's right. On my paper. Not yours, mine, you punk-ass elf.</p>", "8035": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, I know Stephen Hawking. I worked with him.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And if they ever come out with a game called Words with People You Once Worked With, you'll be off to the races.</p>", "8036": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So, I was taking a shower this morning, and when I got out, I started to dry off with what I thought was a towel but turned out to be Howard's mom's underwear. I had to take another shower. It wasn't enough. Nothing will ever be enough.</p>", "8037": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why do you have a history textbook?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, it's not a big deal. Just taking a class at the Pasadena Community College.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Thats great. I didn't know you wanted to go back to school.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's just one history class. Look, I didn't finish college, so I thought I would give it a try.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Not to mention, your acting career is going south like Sherman. Read about it in your book.</p>", "8038": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why would you be embarrassed to tell us?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, I'm not embarrassed. I just didn't want anyone to know because I haven't told Leonard yet.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why wouldn't you tell Leonard?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Because it's me going back to school, and he's gonna be all \"You can do it!\" and \"How can I help?\" and \"I'm so proud of you\". Ugh!</p>", "8039": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I just can't believe you could keep something like that from him.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You guys have got to be the weirdest couple I know.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? You can't think of anyone weirder?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I can, but she's sitting right there.</p>", "8040": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. I play the word quiver with a triple letter and a double word score for 72 points. That ought to let the air out of your tires, Hawking.</p>", "8041": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It is glorious. One of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits. And I'm spanking him so hard his grad students won't be able to sit down.</p>", "8042": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, when one male dominates another, his testosterone level rises.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's your point?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level.</br></p>", "8043": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, you could turn his act into extr<em>act</em>, and it would be for double points.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy. Why would you give me a word? Now, if I play extract it would be cheating.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sorry.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Although, I could play the completely unrelated and better word <em>ex</em>tract. Ethical conundrum avoided. Thanks, brain.</p>", "8044": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Spaghetti okay?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's crunchy. Just the way I like it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I don't think the water was really boiling.</p>", "8045": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, listen, there's something I need to tell you. I've been thinking about going back to school for a while now. So a couple months ago, I started taking a history class at the community college.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh. That's great. Great, great, great. Why wait so long to tell me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't want you to make a big deal out of it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why do you think I'd be like that? I get it, you're taking one class. It's nice. Maybe if it goes well, you take another, you enroll full-time. Ooh, be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're making it a big deal.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sorry. (nonchalantly) Whatever. It's all good.</p>", "8046": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Am I allowed to ask how the class is going?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's really good. We've been talking about the origins of slavery. Turn in my first paper tomorrow.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Great topic. I can help with that. There are lots of different perspectives you can take, economic, sociological, political.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey hey hey, this is my paper. And my perspective is that slavery is bad. Oh, and my professor's black, so I'm pretty sure thats the right answer.</p>", "8047": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I wish we looked as cool dancing in the clubs as we do right now.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't worry, this is exactly how you look when you're dancing in clubs.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You're welcome, ladies.</p>", "8048": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Now behave yourself and eat your dinner. Maybe later, if you're lucky, you get to sleep with a college girl.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? 'cause I went to four years of college and five years of grad school, that never happened once.</p>", "8049": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Earlier today, I invited Professor Stephen Hawking to join me in the popular online game Words with Friends. Moments ago, he accepted my request. Do you understand what that means?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That somewhere right now Stephen Hawking is saying, \"Damn it, I mean to click no.\"</p>", "8050": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Play. Play. Play. Play. Play.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Trying to use a Jedi mind trick to control Stephen Hawking. Play. Play. Ugh! He must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something.</p>", "8051": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll walk you through it. This game is not called Words with Strangers. No, it's not even called Words with Acquaintances. It's called Words with-<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm not finishing your sentence. You pulled the plug on my funk.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Friends! It's Words with Friends. Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are. Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide, and I'll have everything I've ever wanted since I was six years old.</p>", "8052": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I once looked in Sheldon's underwear drawer. He yelled at me. But now I know what it looks like and he can never take that away.</p>", "8053": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hang on. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Chess clock. We each get five minutes to talk about our problems. We'll take turns. Each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend. Begin.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I humiliated Stephen Hawking in a game of Words with Friends. He stopped playing, and now we're not friends anymore.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He's probably busy. You're worried about nothing. Give it a couple more days. I'm sure he'll play, and you'll see that everything's fine. My turn. I can't let Penny hand in a bad paper, but how do I tell her it's bad without letting her know that I read it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm. Beats me. Now, I know Hawking's not busy because I can see he's playing other people right now.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe since you're so good, he's taking his time to meet the challenge. I want Penny to enjoy school...<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wolowitz told me he's a big baby. But I didn't know that, and I played extract for 82 points. It's all Amy's fault. She told me to play it. I have got to cut her loose.</p>", "8054": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Wow, my boyfriend is friends with Stephen Hawking and my new dandruff shampoo doesn't smell like tar. Everything really is coming up Amy.</p>", "8055": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, I wasn't done talking. She hands in the paper tomorrow. I know I could help her. And she's my girlfriend. I, I should be allowed to help her. Why aren't I allowed to help her?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I hear you, brother.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. You need to give me some advice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. Women, huh?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, specific to my situation.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Blond women, huh?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Empathetic.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It sucks to be you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I quit.</br></p>", "8056": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's like when I started doing chin-ups. I didn't want you to see until I could do one. FYI, really close.</p>", "8057": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, of course, it only works on the weak-minded.</p>", "8058": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Good morning, sunshine.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard. It's eight a.m. It's like the middle of the night.</p>", "8059": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's been three days. Why hasn't Stephen Hawking played a word?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> The guy's a genius. Maybe you weren't challenging enough for him?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not challenging? I was humiliating the man. I was thinking of writing a book called A Brief History of the Time I Made Stephen Hawking Cry Like a Little Girl.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> There's the problem. You can't beat Hawking like that. He hates to lose. Everyone knows the guy's a big baby. I mean, forget the wheelchair, he should be in a stroller.</p>", "8060": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, what's this?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, before you open that, um, are you familiar with the story of \"The Shoemaker and the Elves\"?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Elves? Come on, Leonard. It's too early for Lord of the Rings.</p>", "8061": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> One time when I was working with him, he said that Johnny Depp was in The Matrix. I told him he was wrong, but he kept insisting. So I looked it up online and showed him. Well, the next day, he had a pizza party, and everyone got invited but me. And then he was all, your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix.</p>", "8062": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I will play the word \"at\" for two measly points, throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What are you waiting for? Hit send.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't. Losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> So don't do it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, but I want to be Hawking's friend.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So do it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, but if I do, I'll be a phony, a sellout, a Hollywood poser.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Then don't do it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I won't. This feels right. My mother always said, to thine own self be true.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Good for you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> 'course she also told me that every animal in the world got on one boat, so what does she know? And send.</p>", "8063": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I feel like I'm in high school again.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, doing the prom queen's homework so she'll like us.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I know. It's finally working.</p>", "8064": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How'd it go with Leonard?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't think he'll be making that mistake again.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Good.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So, I know this goes without saying, but if either of you tell Leonard you helped me rewrite this paper, I will beat you both with a bag of oranges.</p>", "8065": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Now, ladies, we got a B-minus on this paper. I think if we put our heads together, on the next one we could get an A.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Uh, but we got you a B-minus on purpose to make it believable.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Believable? You saying I'm not smart?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, no!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You're smart.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's better.</p>", "8066": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I feel like I'm in high school again.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, doing the prom queen\u2019s homework so she'll like us.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I know. It's finally working.</p>", "8067": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, what ya doing? Better not be building a robot girlfriend.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. Although Howard was making some real strides in that area until he met Bernadette.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're kidding.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Nope. Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.</p>", "8068": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's kind of crazy. I've never fooled around in the lab before.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? Never?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. I did have a shot with the Lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn't long enough.</p>", "8069": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, you don't have any jewelry on, do you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No. Why?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings. Now he's on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size.</p>", "8070": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A Tardis makes no sense. It's a time machine from a science-fiction show. it has nothing to do with Halloween. That being said, if you don't get a Tardis, you stink and your party stinks.</p>", "8071": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, Stuart, I see you're getting ready for your Halloween party.<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> Yeah, it's my annual attempt to meet women. Ninth time's the charm.</br></p>", "8072": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, you don't worry about money. Ill take care of everything.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, youll love it. Ain't no party like a Koothra-party.</p>", "8073": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> But you know what wasn't a party? That hotel in Kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch. I mean, it's your last night on Earth. You'd think you'd get one porn channel.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Interesting hypothesis. Let's apply the scientific method, perform an experiment.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay. Hey, Howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Anywhere but the Space Station. On a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf. But, hey, you dont go there for the food, you go there for the view.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's fascinating. Let me see if I can duplicate the result. Howard, I've always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit. Care to weigh in?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Not really.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, well.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon. But, hey, that baby got me to space and back.</p>", "8074": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Ladies night at the Cheesecake Factory. Does it get any better than this?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I hope so.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Question. Do you think your husband's fondness for turtlenecks is an expression of longing for his missing foreskin?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's not getting any better.</p>", "8075": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Ugh, it's Leonard. He wants to go costume shopping later.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I thought you liked Halloween.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I do, it's just he wants to go to that party at the comic book store. A lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Like my husband?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And my boyfriend?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm-I'm sorry. Amy, you were saying something about Howard's foreskin?</p>", "8076": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I guess I could probably try a little harder.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You could start by taking an interest in his work.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, that's kind of a problem.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Not really clear on what he does.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> He's an experimental physicist.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I'm not really clear on what that means.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> He takes hypotheses and designs protocols to determine their accuracy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, you're really just making it worse.</p>", "8077": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking, since this is gonna be our first Halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend, I thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I couldn't agree more.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really? I find that inconsistent with everything I know about you.</p>", "8078": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, when I said couples costume, I meant like Romeo and Juliet or Cinderella and Prince Charming, not two robots from some silly movie I don't even like.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, I'm gonna let that slide because I know you're hopped up on tea bags.</p>", "8079": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, no, no, no, don't look in there.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What, is it secret?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, it's a nitrogen laser. It'll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sign right there.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ah. Danger. Sure, sure.</p>", "8080": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What's-what's that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow. High-techie-techie. What's this little box?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That is a pencil sharpener.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, low-techie-techie.</p>", "8081": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, what are you working on right now?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's actually pretty neat.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. It's a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. Here, I'll show you. We'll just put this pencil over here.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.</p>", "8082": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> And then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila. (A floating 3-D image of the pencil appears. Leonard moves it around with his finger)<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow. That is amazing.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, there's a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What do you mean? (Leonard flicks a switch. The hologram changes to a view of the planet Earth). Oh, wow!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really (changes projection to the solar system) just be information (changes the projection to the galaxy) on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos. (Sets the galaxy spinning) So it's possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hmm.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sometimes I forget how smart you are.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You should visit more often.</p>", "8083": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Before I forget, I'd like your opinion on the menus I've prepared for the Halloween party. The theme is food that goes bump in the night.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Creature from the Black Forest Ham Lagoon.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> On Sesame seed Bunzillas.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Night of the Living Garlic Bread?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's funny because bread sounds like dead.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ooh, Hallow-weenies! That's a good one. They'll pair nicely with my Draculoni and Cheese. How do I do it?</p>", "8084": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> That reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume. But then I realized everyone would be, like, where's your costume? Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?</p>", "8085": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hello, boys.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What are you smiling at?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Nothing.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know where's there's a lot of nothing?<br/><strong>Everyone:</strong> Space.</br></p>", "8086": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Boy, it's nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again. Did I tell you about the night my retainer floated out of my mouth and into the air lock?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice.</p>", "8087": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So, here we are, just a couple of young newlyweds. What to do? What to do to you? Astronaut Wolowitz, reporting for booty. Preparing thrusters. We have liftoff. Are we clear to jettison that nightgown?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay, we need to talk.</p>", "8088": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie, I know you went to space. I'm incredibly proud of you. But you might want to try and not bring it up every minute.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't talk about it every minute.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Tonight at dinner you went on bout it for an hour straight.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What was I supposed to talk about? We were eating at Johnny Rockets.</p>", "8089": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Whoa! That is very cool.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I'm the super villain Magneto.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Getting a little less cool, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But what I really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> There we go.</p>", "8090": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, by the way, can I borrow your bull-whip and fedora?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, sure, whatever.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I was thinking of dressing up as Indiana Jones' mocha-skinned love child, Indian Jones.</p>", "8091": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What if we were to go as dinner table favourites salt and pepper?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You know salt makes me retain water and my cousin William was ground to death in a pepper factory accident.</p>", "8092": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How about Raggedy Ann and Andy? I loved them growing up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I don't think so. Those dolls represent three things I do not care for: clowns, children and raggedness. I think it's a lost cause.</p>", "8093": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How do I look?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Uh-oh, is someone a little blue? Come on, Howie, thats like the funniest thing I've ever said in my life.</p>", "8094": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> To tell you the truth, I'm not really in the mood.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What are you talking about? It'll be fun. All your friends'll be there.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, some friends. They all think I'm boring. Maybe you should go without me.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, if I'm there alone, people might think I'm just a really short person from Avatar.</p>", "8095": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm sorry. I just don't want to go.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, I just spent the last three hours colouring myself blue. I'm gonna be washing paint out of my Smurf for a month!</p>", "8096": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, my God, you guys look adorable.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Thanks, so do you. Slutty cop?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, sexy cop. Slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> And Albert Einstein?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ja, und later zhe's going to arrest me for goinc fashter zan da shpeed of light.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I thought we said in the car, no accents?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sorry, Officer.</p>", "8097": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You're my wife. You're supposed to be on my side.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm always on your side.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Then why are you trying to take this away from me? Being an astronaut is the coolest thing I'm ever gonna do. If I stop talking about it, then I'm just...<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Just what?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Plain old Howard Wolowitz is the best guy I know.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're just saying that.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, I'm not. I married him. On purpose. Come here.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I love you.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I love you, too.</p>", "8098": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> \"To Stuart, your comic book store is out of this world. Just like the guy in this picture was.\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For the record, he also thinks Walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's not true. At Walgreens I was over the moon for their store-brand antacids.</p>", "8099": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I just think in relationships you get back what you put into them.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's not always true. Last night, I gave Sheldon my best come-hither look, and he responded by explaining how wheat came to be cultivated.</p>", "8100": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I think I'm gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Two tea bags in one cup? You're not at a rave.</br></p>", "8101": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship. Now imagine this, you and I entering Stuart's party and all eyes turn to see America's most beloved and glamorous couple.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yeah?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> R2-D2 and C-3PO. Dibs on 3PO.</p>", "8102": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century? Hewlett and Packard. Dibs on Hewlett.<br/>\nWhat? You want to be Hewlett?</p>", "8103": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, uh, come in, come in. Oh, I, uh, I didn't think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, well, Bernadette's a little under the weather and my mom's kind of under my dentist.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Former dentist. I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.</p>", "8104": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So you're wandering all around by yourself? That's not the kind of hero's welcome an astronaut should come home to.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's okay. You know, we space cowboys don't do what we do for glory and fame. We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels.</p>", "8105": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> (After leaving Raj and Stuart) At least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.</p>", "8106": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, ow, blueberry in my nose, blueberry in my nose!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Snort it down and keep eating!</p>", "8107": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Come on, let's go home so I can tear off those little pants.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Great. Just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting.</p>", "8108": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, that was quick and a little gross. Now I know how she feels.</p>", "8109": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Why don't we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No good, Sheldon doesn't float.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That is true. I have a higher than normal bone density. If I run too deep a bath, I drown.</p>", "8110": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, I'm a little concerned. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, with all those antioxidants, what if I run out of oxidants?</p>", "8111": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, the NASA Web site says Howard's final descent has begun.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He left a boy, he returns a boy-sized hero.</p>", "8112": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> (singing) Baruch atah, Adonai, Eloheinu. Melech haolam, hamotzi. Lechem min haaretz<br/><strong>Mike:</strong> What's that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The Jewish prayer for eating bread. We don't have one for falling out of space!</p>", "8113": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's a quark-gluon plasma.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Nothing with quarks.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's a chocolate chip cookie.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How could you miss that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie, you draw a glass of milk next to it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny got it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, only after I eliminated all the obvious answers. You're welcome.</p>", "8114": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am not a loser. Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mmm. In all fairness, Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills. It's a pretty well-rounded game.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Lot of big talk from a man who can't draw a chocolate chip cookie.</p>", "8115": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Why don't we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> No good, Sheldon doesn't float.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath, I drown.</br></p>", "8116": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> All right, let's keep it simple. How about darts?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, that's not fair either.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Darts is a bar game. You've been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, that's when it started.</p>", "8117": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests, they're all out.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay. Just for the record, I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest. I've won a few, but that's just because I spill when I'm drunk, so...</p>", "8118": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle, your little star is home. (Fails to open the door) Ma, the chain's on the door.<br/><strong>Mrs. </strong><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Howard? I thought I wasn't going to see you till tomorrow.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, well, Bernie's not feeling well. So I thought I'd stop by, tell you about the greatest adventure of my life, see if you can make me feel bad about it.<br/><strong>Mrs. </strong><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Uh, uh, okay. Hold on, I'm not decent.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> All right. (Speaking to himself) Woman hasn't tied her robe in 20 years. Suddenly she's not decent?</p>", "8119": "<p><strong>Man's Voice:</strong> You want me to hide in the closet or go out the back?<br/><strong>Mrs. </strong><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Shh, you need to whisper.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Ma, who is in there?<br/><strong>Mrs. </strong><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Uh, nobody. The TV is on.<br/><strong>Man's Voice:</strong> I only got one sock. Where's my other sock?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Who is that?<br/><strong>Mrs. </strong><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> I told you, it's the TV. Jay Leno lost a sock, it's hilarious.</p>", "8120": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Dr. Schneider?<br/><strong>Dr. Schneider:</strong> Oh, hello, Howard.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What are you doing here?<br/><strong>Dr. Schneider:</strong> Um, house call.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Youre a dentist.<br/><strong>Dr. Schneider:</strong> Yes. Yes, I am. (Shouting to Mrs. Wolowitz) I think he's on to us!</p>", "8121": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hurry up, find him, find him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm trying. Don't yell at me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For goodness' sake, he's wearing a hat, glasses, and a red striped shirt.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I know what he looks like.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, there he is, I got him.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes, we win again.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How could you not find him?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because he's hard to find. If he was easy to find, the books would be called There's Waldo!</p>", "8122": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, my God, you're back. Oh, look at you. You, you look like you grew.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah. The lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so I'm like an inch and a half taller. I'm going to the DMV tomorrow to get my license changed before I shrink back.</p>", "8123": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, Bernie? Before you go, can you do something for me?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What do you want me to do?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, here it is. I really miss gravity. Can you drop something so I can watch it fall?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Really, you're serious? Okay. (Drops a pencil)<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, baby, you're killing me.</p>", "8124": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, Sheldon? Hi. This came for you today. It's from your mom.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, thank you, Penny.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> M-hmm.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, wait, here. (Hands Penny a dollar bill) For your troubles.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, boy, a whole dollar. Now, I can quit my paper route.</p>", "8125": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, what's in it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mmm, doesn't matter. Half the time, he just ends up playing with the box.</p>", "8126": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, it's journals and research papers I wrote as a child.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aw, how cute. Is this like a diary?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, that's my potty training journal.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really, your potty training journal?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah. And forgive my crude penmanship. I didn't start typing until I was six.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> August 7, 8:42 a.m. This is humiliating. What was wrong with diapers?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, color and consistency.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, disgusting.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, what's disgusting is he's still keeping track.</p>", "8127": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, the point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, perhaps I've already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I didn't know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.</p>", "8128": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, you're going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's a good point. My time is much too valuable. You know, perhaps I should find someone to do it for me. You know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science, but whose real talents lie in menial labor.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not gonna happen.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, if I didn't think you could handle it, I wouldn't be asking.</p>", "8129": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, Ms. Jensen. Uh, before we begin, may I offer you a refreshment? Water, coffee, tea, a marijuana cigarette?<br/><strong>Alex:</strong> No, thanks. I'm fine.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now, are you sure? Everyone's smoking them. I think they're the best.<br/><strong>Alex:</strong> I don't do drugs.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excellent, yeah. That was a ruse. They're not the best. Physics is the best. And by the way, coffee was also an unacceptable choice.</p>", "8130": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, so I see here you're from Des Moines, Iowa. Uh, you're summa cum laude in theoretical physics from Stanford University. Oh, and two years ago, you had a persistent ear infection. I hope that didn't cause any hearing loss.<br><strong>Alex:</strong> No, of course not. How did you know about that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I did a comprehensive background check. Medical records, credit reports, criminal history. (Hiding mouth behind a binder) I trust you paid off those parking tickets.<br/><strong>Alex:</strong> Yes, I did.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hearing unimpaired, good.</br></p>", "8131": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You talk to Howard lately?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, yeah, last night. He kept making me drop pencils for him. I got uncomfortable.</p>", "8132": "<p><strong>Alex:</strong> It's nice to meet you. I'm so excited to be working with Dr-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, please reserve chitchat for your breaks, Ms. Jensen. FYI, there will be no breaks.<br/><strong>Alex:</strong> I should probably get to work.</p>", "8133": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know how much longer I can take this. I can't sleep, and zero gravity is giving me crazy acid reflux. I'm down to my last three Tums.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're going to be fine. You survived that Weight Watchers cruise with your mom. And they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two. Just calm down and take a few deep breaths.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, okay. What am I doing? I'm using up all the oxygen. If I die, promise you'll never have sex with another man.</p>", "8134": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, yeah. I'm a man-eater now.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, for the final touch, this is an eyelash curler. You just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, I don't know. Looks like something used by Tinkerbells gynecologist.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook.</p>", "8135": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, who are you calling?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm going to video-chat Sheldon. If my new look leads to phone sex, I'm going to have to ask you to leave the room.</p>", "8136": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'd like to speak to Sheldon.<br/><strong>Alex:</strong> I'm sorry. Hes asked me to hold all calls unless you're Stephen Hawking, his mother or himself from the future.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> All right. Well, tell him Amy called.<br/><strong>Alex:</strong> Last name?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> He knows my last name. I'm his girlfriend. We have a contract and everything. I'll send you a PDF.</p>", "8137": "<p><strong>Alex:</strong> Here's your frozen yogurt, Dr. Cooper.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> This should be fun.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Half chocolate, half vanilla, side by side, not swirled?<br/><strong>Alex:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?<br/><strong>Alex:</strong> Rainbow, not chocolate.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Two cherries?<br/><strong>Alex:</strong> One on top, one on the bottom.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Stems removed?<br/><strong>Alex:</strong> Um, top one, yes. I didn't check the one on the bottom.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh!<br/><strong>Alex:</strong> I'm so sorry, Dr. Cooper.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's all right, Alex. I'm not mad at you, I'm just disappointed.</p>", "8138": "<p><strong>Alex:</strong> It's okay, I've been around scientists all my life. My dad's an astronomer at SETI.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. You should introduce him to Sheldon. The search is over.</p>", "8139": "<p><strong>Alex:</strong> So, what kind of research are you doing?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> High-energy lasers.<br/><strong>Alex:</strong> Ooh. Military?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not yet, but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away.</p>", "8140": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You were right. I had nothing to worry about. That skank's your problem, not mine.</p>", "8141": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Look at you, putting on a brave face.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> There's nothing to be brave about. Everything's fine.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really? I don't know how much you know about primate behavior, but Sheldon's assistant was clearly courting Leonard. Were she a mandrill, she would have bent over and displayed her brightly colored hindquarters like a big red welcome mat. By the way, you try that at the junior prom, you get kicked out.</p>", "8142": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Fine, it bothers me a little. No. You know what? This is stupid. It doesn't bother me. Okay, it bothers me. But only because she wouldn't stop laughing. Leonard is not that funny.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And there you have it, prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust. If this were a boxing match, they might call it the thrilla adjacent to the amygdala. If you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now.</p>", "8143": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, how was work today?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ah, it was all right, I guess. Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon. Caught Raj right in the eye.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, you're kidding.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, Raj had to go to the nurse.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow. Anything else?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn't talk to her. She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, is that it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Isn't that enough? It had the weaponized fruit and a puppet. What more do you want?</p>", "8144": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, good, Leonard, you're here. Science news. This will interest you. And, Penny, feel free to paint your nails.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you got?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe Alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize. Behold.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> \"Magnets: What Do They Stick To?\" If the answer is metal, it's not exactly groundbreaking.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The original title was A Rederivation of Maxwell's Equations Regarding Electromagnetism. I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch.</p>", "8145": "<p><strong>Alex:</strong> Sheldon thinks the approach in this paper might change the way we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, it's about time. I hated the old way.</br></p>", "8146": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where are we going?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> My limbic system wants to take your pants off.</p>", "8147": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I really miss gravity. Can you drop something so I can watch it fall?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Really, you're serious? Okay.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, baby, you're killing me.</p>", "8148": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You really think there's some kind of scientific discovery in here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, this box only covers my work through nursery school. There's a good deal more to come. I didn't really hit my academic stride until I cut out that time-suck known as playing outdoors.</p>", "8149": "<p><strong>Alex:</strong> Look, Dr. Cooper. I really want this position. It would be an incredible honor to work for a man of your brilliance.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Flattery will not get you this job, Ms. Jensen.<br/><strong>Alex:</strong> It's not flattery if it's the truth.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, well, thank you. Welcome aboard.</p>", "8150": "<p><strong>Alex:</strong> I'm Alex, Dr. Cooper's new assistant.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ah, congratulations and may God have mercy on your soul. I'm Leonard.</p>", "8151": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, remember the Soyuz capsule they were sending to bring us home?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Uh huh.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's delayed. We're gonna be here for at least another week. Maybe ten days. It's the Russians, so you don't know. They left dogs up here in the sixties.</p>", "8152": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're going to be fine. You survived that Weight Watchers cruise with your mom. And they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two. Just calm down and take a few deep breaths.</p>", "8153": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> She is not going to come on to Sheldon.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, really? Look at this face. How can any woman spend eight hours a day alone with this face and not fall in love with it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, for starters, at some point that face starts talking.</p>", "8154": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Isn't it obvious? I'm spreading my scent to mark my territory.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on, Amy. That is not going to work.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really? Because just before you became my best friend, I did this all over your apartment.</p>", "8155": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait, Alex, do you want to join us?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Alex, a moment. I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter.<br/>\nDo you think it's appropriate for her to sit with us, given her station?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Given her what?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If I've learned anything from British television shows on PBS, it's that servants dine down stairs with their own kind.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's a kindness, Leonard. Otherwise, you're cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that's just beyond their soot-stained fingertips.</p>", "8156": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How you doing, Howie? You feeling a little better?\n<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, a lot better, thanks. One sec. Listen close, I don't have a lot of time. I need you to go to my house. In my bedroom, you'll find a model rocket. I want you to take it and bring it back to your place.\n<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay.\n<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Step two, build a version roughly fourteen stories high. Fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me. I'll leave the door unlocked.\n<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone, let them know you're having a little anxiety.\n<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, no, I'm fine. No anxiety. We should probably talk in code. From now on, frog is me, sandwich means you and lemon means rocket. So, come on, sandwich, build me a lemon 'cause froggy wants to come home.</p>", "8157": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, of course he's desirable. I mean, he's great. He's smart, he's sweet and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let me tell you he really tries.</p>", "8158": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, my turn. Let me talk to him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Go ahead.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> 2311 North Los Robles Avenue, Pasadena, California to International Space Station. Can you read me? Over. (Makes static noise)<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes, I read you, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Copy that. Over. (Static)<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am talking to a man in space. If you don't have the (static) then he might as well be at the Coffee Bean over on Lake Street.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're out of your mind, Sheldon!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's a negative. My mother had me tested. Over.</p>", "8159": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What's the big deal? You guys are bringing your girlfriends. I didn't want to sit by myself.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The big deal is I was expecting us to be an intimate group of five. Now, we're going to be a faceless mass of six.</p>", "8160": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It'll be fine. Just, uh, pretend he's Wolowitz.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm. Do you like Raisinets?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I can take them or leave them.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> At the movies, Wolowitz always eats Raisinets.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Would you feel more comfortable if I ate Raisinets?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, it's hardly my business what you eat. As long as it doesn't crunch during the film and it's Raisinets.</br></p>", "8161": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Penny said she's not sure she wants to be Leonard's girlfriend anymore.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard, why on earth would she guzzle a witches' brew of his soda and spit?</p>", "8162": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Raisinet?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Shh, we're trying to watch the movie. (To Amy) This is not working out with him.</p>", "8163": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> *Knock, knock, knock* Leonard? *Knock, knock, knock* Leonard? *Knock, knock, knock* Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you sleeping?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I was. Now I'm having a nightmare.</p>", "8164": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I was having a little trouble sleeping and I just thought, uh, seeing as you're up, we could talk.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Talk about what?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I don't know. Uh, weather. Uh, fish you could do carpentry with. Why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend. Yeah, pick one. Your choice.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did you know that Leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that? Hubba-hubba.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, go home, crazy man.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah. Did you know that while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country, in today's North Korea, he's downright average. Hey, talk about a keeper.</p>", "8165": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My point is, I don't like when things change. So, regardless of your feelings, I would like you to continue dating Leonard. And also, while we're on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo. I'm not comfortable with the new scent. Please stop this madness and go back to green apple.</p>", "8166": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> (Puts Penny on hold, answers a new call) Hello?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, just a heads-up: Penny knows that you blabbed about Leonard. She's pretty mad.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I know. She's yelling at me right now.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right then, so we're all on the same page.</p>", "8167": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why don't you stand up to them?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What am I supposed to say?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't know. Say, being mean is lame, what's cool is being nice.</p>", "8168": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Great, I'll do that when I want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Do you want me to call somebody at NASA?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No. My mom already tried that. It only made things worse.</p>", "8169": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Focused Locust.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Temple of Yip.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry. Wolowitz would never play that card.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> All right, Lesser Demon Turtle.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fairy God Monster, I win. Your desperate need for friendship makes you weak.</p>", "8170": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, what are you guys doing later? Stuart and I were thinking of going out for a drink.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> We're gonna try to meet some girls.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> 'cause that's what we do.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Watch out, ladies, a little coffee and cream coming your way.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> In case you didn't follow that, I'm the coffee.</p>", "8171": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you remember how upset I was when they replaced Edward Norton as the Hulk?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, you walked around for a week saying, Sheldon unhappy with casting choice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But, then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers, and he was even better.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's your point?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Call me a romantic. I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo is still out there somewhere.</p>", "8172": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, it's fine. We're not getting married, okay? We're keeping things, you know, homeostasis.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's so cute when she tries.</p>", "8173": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, one gravy boat.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's from Sheldon. He told me he had it engraved.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> In the event of divorce, please return to Sheldon Cooper.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> One inappropriate, yet I wish I thought of that, gravy boat.</p>", "8174": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm not unhappy at all. It's just, I don't know, I've been in love before, but it felt different. But maybe this is a new, better, boring kind of love. Do you ever feel that way about Howard?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, that's not really a fair comparison. I'm basically married to a sexy Buzz Lightyear.</p>", "8175": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Amy, you?<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Can't help ya, kid. Whenever I'm around Sheldon, I feel like my loins are on fire. In the good way. Not the urinary tract infection way.</br></p>", "8176": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You're out of your mind, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's a negative. My mother had me tested. Over.</p>", "8177": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, you are not in charge.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner.</p>", "8178": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> FYI, secret keeping? Hate it. Hand-holding? Not a fan. Hammerhead shark? I love that thing. Yeah, it's another fish with a tool on its head.</p>", "8179": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's something I need to tell you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't tell you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't tell you why I can't tell you. So I guess there's two things I can't tell you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I wish there were more.</p>", "8180": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, I think I understand.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You do?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you, but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That is literally the stupidest thing I've ever heard.</p>", "8181": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> The other astronauts are being mean to me.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What are they doing?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, like for instance, the other day when I was asleep, one of the guys went on a space walk and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask to the outside of my window. When I woke up, I screamed for like nine minutes.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, Howie.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You can see it if you want. It's on YouTube. Google astronaut screams for nine minutes.</p>", "8182": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, maybe you'd like to go with them to meet girls.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why would I be interested? I have Penny.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, for now. But that woman has a death wish, Leonard. She talks to strangers, she pets unfamiliar dogs, and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment. If I were you, I'd get a back-up.</p>", "8183": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You slept with him?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I didn't know what else to do. He had those big, sad eyes.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, sure, you had no choice.</p>", "8184": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I must admit, I can't help but feel a twinge of envy. He can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes. His dim, uncomprehending eyes. It's like a cat in an airport carrying case.</p>", "8185": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Just a couple of minutes. You've really never done this before?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Once in high school, but I dozed off and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, my gosh, that's awful. The other kids make fun of you?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, I had a cover story, I told everyone it was herpes.</p>", "8186": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm all for it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Attaboy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, hang on. Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I don't?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Leonard. Let's not take a saw to the branch we're sitting on, shall we?</p>", "8187": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, if you guys are free tonight, I heard about a spa where you soak your feet in a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them. I don't need to tell you in Los Angeles, sandal season is year round.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Actually, I'm hanging out with Penny.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, okay. Sounds like it's me and you, Sheldon. How about we stick some guppies on those puppies?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As I've stated before on numerous occasions, the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken. Because the last words I would hear are \"Release the Kraken.\" That never gets old. \"Release the Kraken!\" Chills.</p>", "8188": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Besides, I'm having dinner with Amy.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, okay. I'll just go home and be alone. Which is cool. I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone. So, cool.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Darn. If you weren't busy, I'd ask you to join us.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really? I can come? Thanks!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, absolutely. I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation and casual physical contact, but nowhere is it specified that I can't outsource that to an Indian.</p>", "8189": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay. Okay, I know you're upset, but let me share something I've learned since I got here. You realize how small your problems are when you're looking down on them from space. Now, come on, that's got to make you feel better.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How clear is the image of me on that screen?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Pretty clear.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Do I look like I feel better?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I mean, it's not, like, HD quality.</p>", "8190": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Listen, mister, you're gonna talk to your mother and you're gonna fix this, or that thing I said I was gonna do to you the minute you got home, you can do to yourself.<br><strong>Dimitri:</strong> Like he's been doing since he got here.</br></p>", "8191": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, this place is so romantic.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I'm glad you like it. Raj picked it out.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, when you see him, tell him I say thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Tell him yourself.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yoo-hoo! Over here!</p>", "8192": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't understand. What's he doing here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I invited him.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> On our date? Sheldon, that's not okay.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, it is. There's a loophole in the Relationship Agreement.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You found a loophole?</p>", "8193": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Gosh, I worked my ass off today. This is exactly what I needed.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Great. Just relax and enjoy. Tonight is all about you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aw, thank you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, where exactly are we in this relationship?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, come on.</p>", "8194": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Absolutely. You're the girl, I'm the guy. Now, you watch your football game while I make you a little plate here.</p>", "8195": "<p>Dimitri: Hey, Froot Loops. You got a phone call.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Who is it?<br/>\nDimitri: A woman who says she's your mother but sounds like your father.</p>", "8196": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, I'm having the nicest time. You guys are like family to me. You know that, right?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's great. Get out.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What? Why?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, pish on your issues. You guys are fine.</p>", "8197": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes, you hit some bumps along the way. I mean, Penny, you've always known how this man has felt about you, but you made him grovel for affection.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, hold on...<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Now, dont blame yourself. He was a groveler from way back. But the point is, the two of you got past it. And, Leonard, you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex? That was some weak tea, dude.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Some people might say it was romantic.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, no. But yet, here you two are, still together. And that's even after you and I had our crazy naked night.</p>", "8198": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm just saying that after everything you've been through, you get to look into each other's eyes and say \"I love you.\" And that's beautiful.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Actually, to this day, she's never really said it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, Penny. That's ridiculous. You know you love him. You, you look him in the eyes and you say it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Raj.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh come on, you know you want to say it. Say it. Say you love him. Say it!</p>", "8199": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> A little music?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sure. Mmm, bossa nova. You listen to that with your hips as well as your ears.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Mmm.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh. Something about Latin music just makes me feel like I'm on a white sand beach in Rio.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Yeah. The sun, the waves, the beautiful bodies, tanned and glistening with sweat.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I should go.</p>", "8200": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, I'm growing to like American football.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, it's fun, isn't it?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, it's not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket, but hey, what is?</p>", "8201": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey Mike?<br/><strong>Mike Massimino:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I changed my mind. I don't want to do this.<br/><strong>Mike:</strong> Good one.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, I'm a funny guy. I also have a hysterical bit planned for later where I pretend to cry through the whole launch.</p>", "8202": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> There's Howard's rocket, live from Kazakhstan.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, God, I'm so nervous. I don't think I can watch.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Youre nervous? I've been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I'm wearing my fat pants.</p>", "8203": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Remarkable. In just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howard's keister. And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy has been Tetris and mail-order brides.</p>", "8204": "<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Hey, Froot Loops, want to hit your fan switch?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Check.<br/><strong>Dimitri:</strong> He calls you Froot Loops because of your very gay haircut?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, it's 'cause I live with my mom and she makes me Froot Loops.<br/><strong>Dimitri:</strong> Go with gay story, people are more accepting of that.</p>", "8205": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Close your eyes. Put out your hand. I got you something special.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Come on, Howard. I'm not falling for that again.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, here.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, Howie. A little star, it's beautiful. Put it on me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, but I'm going to have to get it back from you so I can take it to the International Space Station. That way, when I come home, you will have a star that was actually in space.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, my God.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Take that, every guy who's ever bought you anything.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> This is the most amazing gift I've ever gotten.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really? Well, if you like it that much, then close your eyes and put out your hand.</br></p>", "8206": "<p><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> You know what, I'll buy you All-Bran in case you get stopped up in outer space.</p>", "8207": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you for the invitation, but I have to decline because it doesn't sound like something I'll enjoy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, Sheldon, it'll be fun.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's what you said about The Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong.</p>", "8208": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So, what do you say, Amy?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Can I wear my maid of honour dress?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Seriously? You're going to wear that thing to City Hall?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's all I have left. You're going to take that from me, too?</p>", "8209": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where'd you get a beer?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> From that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. Beautiful story. They're in rival drug gangs, and they're getting married. Shh, no one can know.</p>", "8210": "<p><strong>Registrar:</strong> Folks, can I have your attention. It's five o'clock, we're going to be able to take three more couples. The rest of you will have to come back on Monday.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, no.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I got this. Excuse me, but is there any way you could squeeze us in? See, I'm an astronaut and I'm leaving for Russia on Sunday so I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station.<br/><strong>Registrar:</strong> Yeah, me, too. I'll see you there.</p>", "8211": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I can't believe we're not going to get married.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Excuse me, I'm going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honor.</p>", "8212": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I keep telling you, if I wasn't an astrophysicist, I would have been a party planner. It was always a coin flip.</p>", "8213": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out who's going to do the ceremony.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, that's easy. Anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister. I know a piercing parlor where for a hundred bucks they'll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Great, well, who's it going to be?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll do it, provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What do you see in her?</p>", "8214": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> There's fuel leaking and we're still going to go?<br/><strong>Mike:</strong> Don't lose your Froot Loops, Froot Loops.<br/><strong>Dimitri:</strong> This happens a lot. Nine times out of ten, no problem.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What happens on the tenth time?<br/><strong>Dimitri:</strong> Problem.</p>", "8215": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother. I'll be right back.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why can't she drive herself?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She doesn't want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so I'm going to lay her down in the back of my neighbor's van.</p>", "8216": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> I'm fine where I am. I don't want to fall off the roof.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You'll fall through the roof before you fall off it.</p>", "8217": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Howard and Bernadette, the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers.<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> Louder!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> They all got ordained. They're all marrying us. It's adorable. If you want to hear come closer.</p>", "8218": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, I'll go. Howard and Bernadette, I know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding, but when you're in love, it doesn't matter where or how these things happen. It just matters that you have each other.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hmm.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Problem?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, grow up.</p>", "8219": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howard Joel Wolowitz, like you, this is going to be short and sweet. I love you with all my heart and soul and promise to be with you forever.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski...<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> Speak up!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, from now on, she's the only women who can yell at me!</p>", "8220": "<p>Gang: By the power vested in us, by the state of California...<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And the Klingon High Council...<br/><br/></br></p>", "8221": "<p><strong>Mike:</strong> That's ignition. I love this part.<br/><strong>Dimitri:</strong> Me, too.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I have strongly mixed feelings.</p>", "8222": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> No, no, no, this is not the wedding I wanted. I wanted to wear my maid of honor dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me, while a string quartet plays The Way You Look Tonight.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That wasn't going to be our procession music.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, it was going to be mine.</p>", "8223": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, I know tons of people who got married in Vegas.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Are any of them still married?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. I mean not to the same people, but...</p>", "8224": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. Which places me in your debt and I can't be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move. Or to kill a man.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I doubt he'll ask you to kill a man.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, what if it's his only way out? I can't risk it.</p>", "8225": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I can't believe it. This whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying.</p>", "8226": "<p><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> Your new mother-in-law's a piece of work.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Not now, Dad.<br/><strong>Mike Rostenkowski:</strong> She's got a bigger mustache than me.</p>", "8227": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes, yes, I've been doing my push-ups. I'm still stuck at nine, but that's going all the way down with no one holding me.</p>", "8228": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes! Thank you! Oh! Oh! Im not gonna die in space! Im gonna die the way God intended, in my late 50s, with a heart full of pastrami.</p>", "8229": "<p>Assistant: Why don't you slip this on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Said the hangman offering a noose.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, that wasn't as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes, but it was right up there.</p>", "8230": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I wasn't worried.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You weren't?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Let me explain the difference between you and me. You watch Star Trek. I live it.</p>", "8231": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah, much better.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You must be burning up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A little. But not more than your urethras will be after whatever's in those pants swims up them.</p>", "8232": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don't I? I look like the Flash about to get married.</p>", "8233": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh! A tissue! A tissue! Oh, good Lord!<br/>\nAssistant: Uh, where's he going?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He keeps emergency Purell in the car.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Keys! Keys! Keys!</p>", "8234": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I've been thinking, and maybe I'm ready to take things a little faster.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, great. And I promise, after waiting four months, fast is what you're gonna get.</p>", "8235": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, just-just one thing. Look, we're in a really great place right now, and I don't want to do anything that will make stuff all weird again.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> So we won't let it get weird.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up, mm, since the last time you saw me naked, I got a Cookie Monster tattoo. The acceptable responses when you see it are awesome or nothing.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What about ... (in a low voice) Cookies!</br></p>", "8236": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Seven o'clock, right on time.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not an accident. I waited outside your door for twenty minutes.</p>", "8237": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> With our friends moving forward in their relationships, I've decided that we should make progress in ours as well.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, dear Lord. Two years ago, we didn't even know each other, and now I'm in your apartment after dark. How much faster can this thing go?</p>", "8238": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up. In your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera. I'm going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, it seems what's on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock.</p>", "8239": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> We'll see. Let's start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Super Mario Bros. theme?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I see what you're doing. You're attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game, admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood, but it won't work.</p>", "8240": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, I know. I think it will go nicely with what I have prepared for dinner.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Just like your mommy used to make.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh yummy, yummy! We should do this more often. Uh-oh.</p>", "8241": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sorry. I- I crossed a line. I didn't mean to!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know, it just came out. People say weird things during sex all the time.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, well, they sure as hell don't say that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It was the heat of the moment.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, the heat of the moment is, ooh, yeah, just like that, not will you marry me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sorry. Just, just give me another chance.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go, hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighborhoods with good schools?</p>", "8242": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, at some point, we'll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why don't we just start doing that now?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're kidding.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. Hey, do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed? And you were all, like, what are you doing? That was so funny. So funny.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's not funny.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Give it a minute. Is that a little smile I see there? I should go.</p>", "8243": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, I was thinking. For our first dance at the wedding, what if we learn the final number from Dirty Dancing?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're kidding.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, come on. How cool would that be? Me running into your arms, you lifting me up into the air.</p>", "8244": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Bishop to queen four, level two. Check.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, knight takes bishop. You all right?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm fine.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you? You left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, why me?</p>", "8245": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers. I don't like my own sweat touching my skin. How do you think I feel about theirs?</p>", "8246": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, that wasn't as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes, but it was right up there.</p>", "8247": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I must say, I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. As I mentioned, the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times. And later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale. You ask anyone, that's a hot date.</p>", "8248": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I had a feeling you'd be reluctant, which is why I'm going to dip into my neurological bag of tricks.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away.</p>", "8249": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I love strawberry Quik. It's my favorite pink fluid, narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol.</p>", "8250": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can I ask you a question about women?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> We got you that book last year. Wasn't everything in there?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I'm having a relationship problem with Amy. And by the way, that book gave me nightmares.</br></p>", "8251": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I just threw up the bachelor party.</p>", "8252": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Howard, I'm going to say something to you that everybody's thinking but nobody has the courage to say out loud. When you invite a man to a bachelor party, the implication is there will be strippers. Maybe not completely nude, but at least pasties and G-strings. That's not unreasonable!</p>", "8253": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I wish you could all be inside my head. The conversation is sparkling.<br/>\nFine, I'll tell you. A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi and algae. If you could merge with another species, what species would you pick and why? Hint, there is a right answer. None of you will get it.</p>", "8254": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, I'd pick swan because the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck I've always dreamed of having.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wrong.</p>", "8255": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wrong, and let's keep it clean, shall we?</p>", "8256": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Kangaroo. Uh, I'd be a Kanga-Jew - the first of my people to dunk a basketball.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Also instead of just living in your mother's house, you could actually live inside her body.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Clever, but also wrong.</p>", "8257": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They've got that wine train.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Boo, wine! But yay, trains. I'm in.</p>", "8258": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's a bachelor party. There could be strippes. Wouldn't that make you jealous?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on, Leonard, it's you. What's going to happen? I mean, even if there is a stripper, all you'd do is avoid eye contact and maybe offer to help her kid with homework.</p>", "8259": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I've been doing some research on strippers. One agency I spoke to, said I could get us a great price if we're flexible on age range and number of limbs.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sounds like loads of fun, but I promised Bernadette no strippers.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You don't want strippers? You're the king of strippers. The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What can I tell ya, I'm not into that stuff any more.</p>", "8260": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Good for you, Howard. I'm proud of you. And still, you're the first one of us to get married. We have to do something special.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, it's probably not for me.</p>", "8261": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, have fun tonight.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I will. There is no telling what might happen.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes, there is.</p>", "8262": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, I got to hand it to Raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not bad. Unless you compare it to a train, then it stinks.</p>", "8263": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Whoa, it's a little early to start dropping J-bombs, don't you think?</p>", "8264": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm confused. I thought since our reconciliation, I was your friend in this group.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Oh, I'm friends with Howard too.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I guess you're just friends with anybody. (drinks again) Urgh!</p>", "8265": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> These are gift bags we're going to put in the hotel rooms of our out-of-town guests. This is a map of Pasadena. This is a list of local restaurants. And then, for Howie's relatives, we have antihistamines, antacids, and medicine for diarrhea and constipation.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, we labeled them stop and go.</br></p>", "8266": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> All right, pivoting to the big question. Bernadette, on your wedding night you'll be consummating your marriage. What do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and wife?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Amy, please.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Keeping in mind that whoever's on top may set the tone for the marriage.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, show's over.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night. Don't you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it happened?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't care. Ask her things like are you going to take Howard's name? Not who's going to sit on who.</p>", "8267": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I've actually been thinking I'm going to hyphenate, Bernadette Mary-Ann Rostenkowski-Wolowitz.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Nice. You know, you should totally get BernadetteMaryAnnRostenkowskiWolowitz.com before someone snaps it up.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howard already took care of it.</p>", "8268": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Plus, he set up our beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our family histories. Do you know, for a while in Poland, my family and his family were neighbors.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's cool.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, it's not. I'll explain it to you later.</p>", "8269": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> May I have your attention, please? We are here tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend Howard Wolowitz.<br/><strong>Everybody:</strong> Hear! Hear!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And apparently Wil Wheaton's best friend.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Sheldon...<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Talk to the hand.</p>", "8270": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, Howard Wolowitz tying the knot. Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. He was a wild one. Well, I guess we all kind of were. I remember this one time, I was with this girl at the beach. We were in the ocean and we started making out. I know, it was crazy. I wasn't even wearing my Aquasocks.</p>", "8271": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I think back to all the good times we had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. I told him I'm addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She was my second cousin.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually. Ba-da-bazinga!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one's my favorite!</p>", "8272": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> The only threesome I've ever had in my life, and I'm proud to say it was with this man right here.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, please shut up.</p>", "8273": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Thank you for picking us up. There's a warning, right there, on the Scotch bottle. \"You cannot be operatin heavy machinery after you had a snootful of this, laddie!\"</p>", "8274": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, we're not that far from my apartment. If you stop the car, I can walk from here.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You ain't goin' anywhere, Three-way.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Bernadette, listen...<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You lied to me. You said you told me about all the girls you've been with, but you never mentioned your cousin, the prostitute or Raj!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Seriously, you don't even have to stop the car. Anything under ten miles an hour and I can combat-roll into the street.</p>", "8275": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, just to set the record straight, I didn't hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him. Shame on you, Raj. That is not how we treat women in this country.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Don't you try and blame this on him.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you, Bernadette.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Zip it, pervert!</p>", "8276": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm supposed to marry Howard in a couple of weeks and I'm not sure I even know who the man is any more.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm curious what's bothering you most, the borderline incest, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children's cartoon?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Amy, remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldn't?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Right. And that was...<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Not.</p>", "8277": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> When I first met Howard, he seemed so innocent to me, just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, if that's what you like, I'll take you to the comic book store, the place is full of 'em.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Wait a minute. You set me up with Howard. Did you know about all the creepy stuff he was into?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, a little. You hear stuff.</p>", "8278": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why didn't you tell me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I was gonna, but I didn't think it would go past the first date. Then, when it did, I thought for sure it wouldn't go past you meeting his mother. Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together. I mean, the warning signs were there, this is really on you.</p>", "8279": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know what my next move is.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, Howard, I don't know much about women.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, uh, that, that's it. I don't know much about women.</p>", "8280": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Please come out, Bernadette. Let's talk through this.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, leave me alone.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine. Do you have a cousin who you find attractive?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Amy!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, you introduced him to the sleaze bag. I'm just trying to clean up your mess.</br></p>", "8281": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I need to talk to Bernadette.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I don't think she wants to talk to anyone right now.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, well, could you at least give her a message?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, sure, I guess.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Tell her I'm really sorry, and if she doesn't want to marry me, I get it. But what I really want her to know is the guy that she's disgusted by, is the guy that I'm disgusted by, too. But that guy doesn't exist any more, he's gone, and the reason is because of her. So, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you.</p>", "8282": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, my God, Howard. That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. And it came out of you.</p>", "8283": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Is there anything else about your past I should know?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas. I'll tell you later.</p>", "8284": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm gonna have sex with you right here, right now, on that washing machine.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, you're not.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, please.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> If you want to do something, you can help me fold this sheet.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy.</p>", "8285": "<p><br/><strong><strong>Sheldon:</strong></strong> I'm not asking for me. I'm asking for Hawking.<br/><br/><strong><strong>Wolowitz:</strong></strong> Let me try it gangsta, hellz naw!</p>", "8286": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard, please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, you can't be serious.</p>", "8287": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine you're the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out there's another human being.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hang on, are you saying the rest of us are dogs?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. I can see you're going to take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine you're the sole human being on a planet populated with nothing but chimps.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Get out of my lab.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, now they're much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those bicycles?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Get out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How about dolphins?</p>", "8288": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's a lot of belt buckles.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Funny thing is, I have only one belt. Anyway, I'll get you started. Oh, by the way, the little marks that look like water spots, I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so what you're seeing there is splash back.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You make sissy on your belt buckles? Mee-Maw's forks never had that.</p>", "8289": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I should have sent you to the custom car cover place in Altadena. They have her pattern on file.</p>", "8290": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So, I got the craziest e-mail this morning.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't mean to burst your bubble, dude, but those penile enlargement pills do not work.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Believe me, I know.</p>", "8291": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're kidding.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> He's coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture, and he's looking for an engineer to help maintain the equipment on his wheelchair.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's amazing. You'll be like his pit crew. A word of caution, I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (imitating Stephen Hawking) You're right. I suppose that could be considered offensive.</p>", "8292": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, boy, Sheldon's going to freak out.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, he worships Hawking.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I was actually thinking about bringing him along when I go over there so he can meet the great man.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's really nice of you, Howard.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hmm, it's no big deal.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It'll look so nice next to the ones he's already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.</p>", "8293": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanity's understanding of the Higgs boson particle, and you said, Sheldon, it's two a.m., get out of my bedroom?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I believe I've done it. And I'm only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it.</p>", "8294": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinking Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isn't going to make any sense to you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, good for you, and don't stop working on it.</p>", "8295": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Please, please, please let me meet Hawking.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> I told you, no.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I said I'm sorry.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, you said, would it help if I said I'm sorry?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?</br></p>", "8296": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard, please, I'm begging you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Raj, you're our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade, he begged a deity he doesn't believe in to end his life quickly.</p>", "8297": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you understand how important Hawking is to me? When I was six years old, I dressed up as him for Halloween.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're kidding.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, sir. No, I took my dad's desk chair, attached a Speak &amp; Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy.</p>", "8298": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, look, how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough I've made, he'll reach out to me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What if he doesn't?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He will, he's really smart.</p>", "8299": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You do realize you own his ass right now.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I do.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You can make him do anything you want.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, I know, I'm just trying to figure out how much I want to punish him.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, don't be too mean.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, fellas, I'm thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I wouldn't mind a glass.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I wasn't talking to you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Bring him to his bony knees.</p>", "8300": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'll give your paper to Professor Hawking.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Great, thank you. Oh, that's terrific.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But in exchange, I'd like you to do a few things for me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What kinds of things?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Are you familiar with the 12 labors of Hercules?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You should be so lucky.</p>", "8301": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right. What would you like me to do first?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, I thought I'd start you off by polishing my belt buckles.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maw's silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's nice.</p>", "8302": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Here is a black light to check them. And for your own peace of mind, you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room.</p>", "8303": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, these look great. They're like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. How'd you get them so shiny?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My Mee-Maw must never know of this.</p>", "8304": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Wearing a French maid costume) What are you all staring at? Didn't you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?</p>", "8305": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is not my laundry.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, are these Amy's? Kind of trashy, good for her.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Those are Howard's.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ugh.</p>", "8306": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Why are you washing Howard's man panties?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because if I don't, he won't give my paper to Stephen Hawking. He's a famous physicist.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, yeah, I know. He's the wheelchair dude who invented time.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's close enough.</p>", "8307": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't understand. Why doesn't Howard just introduce you to the guy?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because he's punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. You don't think I'm condescending, do you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well...<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry, condescending means...</p>", "8308": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What's the matter?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Every time I spend the night, your mom slaps me on the behind and says, go get 'im.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's not her fault. She's getting hormone replacement therapy. Makes her crazy horny.</p>", "8309": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why are you doing that? You're being mean to him.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> He's mean to me all the time. You've heard him tease me about not having a doctorate.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> If you don't want to get teased about that, get a doctorate. I have one, they're great.</p>", "8310": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, guys, I just remembered. I got you some Hawking souvenirs.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are these?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Gears and springs from his wheelchair. Pretty cool, huh?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wow, that's amazing.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went.</br></p>", "8311": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong>  Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, for heaven's sake. I did your laundry. I peepee-proofed your belt buckle. I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom.</p>", "8312": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, Sheldon. There's only one thing left I want you to do. Don't worry, it's an easy one.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Give me a compliment.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. You have very tiny hands.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, about my job. I want you to tell me I'm good at what I do.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're obviously good at what you do.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, then why are you always ripping on me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I understand the confusion. I have never said that you are not good at what you do. It's just that what you do is not worth doing.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's nicer than anything he's ever said to me. I'd take it and run.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thank you, Sheldon.</p>", "8313": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Professor Hawking, it's an honor and a privilege to meet you, sir.<br/><strong>Stephen Hawking:</strong> I know.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I want to thank you for taking time to see me.<br/><strong>Stephen Hawking:</strong> My pleasure. I enjoyed reading your paper very much. You clearly have a brilliant mind.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know.</p>", "8314": "<p><strong>Stephen Hawking:</strong> Your thesis that the Higgs boson is a black hole accelerating backwards through time is fascinating.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you. It just came to me one morning in the shower.</p>", "8315": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no, no, no, of course not. Its just, I was thinking Oh, gosh, golly, I made a boo-boo, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking.<br/><strong>Stephen Hawking:</strong> Great, another fainter.</p>", "8316": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hello Mummy, Daddy, how are you?<br/><strong>Mrs. Koothrappali:</strong> Pretty good, can't complain.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Oh I'm sure you can. Just give it a minute.</p>", "8317": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Matchmaking, very smart move son. Much better than marrying for love.<br/><strong>Mrs. Koothrappali:</strong> We married for love.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> And it's been wonderful.</p>", "8318": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Listen, uh, there's something I want to talk to you about. I, I wasn't ready until now, but I think it's time.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> It's finally happening. You're coming out of the closet, aren't you?<br/><strong>Mrs. Koothrappali:</strong> We love you, and we accept your alternate lifestyle.<br/>\nJust, keep it to yourself.</p>", "8319": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend. Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars marathon.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Woo-hoo!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Movies or video games? Or board game? Or trading card games? Or Lego's? Or dress up? Or comic books? Or dramatic readings of novelizations? Yes to all!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We are going to play the online game.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The online game? Bully!</p>", "8320": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> No, hang on. I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement. I made a written record request 72 hours in advance. I checked the tire pressure on the car. I even contacted the Centres For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County. FYI, it's none.</p>", "8321": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You use it to get your way.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I use it to get the right way. The fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence.</p>", "8322": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello Stuart.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hey Sheldon. Help you with anything?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. I'm attending a party this weekend, for a 93-year-old woman. Can you recommend a gift?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Uh, I don't know. Could put a tennis ball on the end of Excalibur. Make a pretty badass cane.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you supply the tennis ball?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> No.</p>", "8323": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What else?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hmm. Oh, have this collectors edition Batman utility belt. Maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, she'd just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume.</p>", "8324": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, Leonard, go ahead and mock. Like my daddy always said, Shelly, women aren't anything but flippin pains in the bottom.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's what your father used to say?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I took out the bad words and the yeehaw, but you get the gist.</p>", "8325": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You can't put a saddle on Leonard Hofstadter. Oh, my, is it getting hot in here? Ay, papi.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ay papi? What is that?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> An acting choice.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh. So you chose that when you become turned on, you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Choo got a problem with that, papi?</br></p>", "8326": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, Penny. I just stopped by to bring you this gift.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Gummy bears? Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now that you're in my debt, please manipulate Amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt's tedious birthday party.</p>", "8327": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right. I thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante. These are Cooper Coupons. These are for various things I can do for you. Um, oh, this one is for one free grammar check. Uh, you could use it for emails, letters, tattoos, what have you. Um, oh, this is fun one. This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center, where I point out their mistakes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Keep an eye on those expiration dates, I've been burned more than once.</p>", "8328": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, come on. It's just a simple favor. Now, when's the last time I asked you to do something for me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When is the last time I asked you to do something that wasn't a medical emergency?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.</p>", "8329": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, then, I have no choice but to go on to plan B.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What's that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold.</p>", "8330": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I think you're really going to enjoy yourself today. Not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my aunt's nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. It's like a vacation for your teeth.</p>", "8331": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You sure you're okay with this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. I decided to find a way that I could have this experience and enjoy it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Thank you. That means a lot to me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, don't thank me. Thank wireless technology. I realized, I can go to your aunt's awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and youre going to be sitting there playing a game? Isn't that a little rude?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I got that covered. Headset. I won't hear a word the old geezers are saying.</p>", "8332": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, if playing that game is more important to you than honoring your commitment to me, and you don't mind me showing up at a party all by myself after I've already told everybody I'll be bringing somebody, then, fine. Go home and play your game.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thanks. Ooh, listen, I wouldn't mind a piece of birthday cake, provided the old gal's candle blow is clean and dry.</p>", "8333": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Here you go. I've got everything well need for the big game. Low fat turkey jerky, low-carb beer, 100-calorie snack packs.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there? You might be short one.</p>", "8334": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Bernadette's going to be playing with us. So, that's pretty cool, huh? Right? Sure it is, yeah.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What, you invited your girlfriend? This is supposed to be our weekend.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I had no choice. Last night, she said, why don't we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum. And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didn't answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she's parking the car right now.</p>", "8335": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Amy, what's wrong?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> My boyfriend's a jerk.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I know he didn't cheat on you, so what happened?</p>", "8336": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I had to go to my aunt's party all by myself, and everybody was like, \"Where's this boyfriend you're always talking about? Is he real, or did you make him up like Armin the miniature horse breeder?\"<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Who's Armin the miniature horse breeder?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back. It unraveled quickly when I couldn't answer the question how'd you two meet?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I would have thought at a miniature horse show.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, that's good.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mm.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I panicked and said Woodstock. I just wanted to show Sheldon off to my family.</p>", "8337": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, Amy, sometimes when you're in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you ever worry about Leonard doing that to you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's hilarious. No.</p>", "8338": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Get that guy! Get that guy! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Dr. Rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isn't as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesn't make the land speeder go.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (aiming at Sheldon) Pew!</p>", "8339": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence, I bet he didn't know how much fun it was killing stuff.</p>", "8340": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, I think we got them all. Let's divide up the loot.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got. You should put on yours and then we'll match.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But I worked hard to get this Armour.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sorry, I just thought it'd be nice if people knew we were a couple.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine, I'll change.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (whip sound app) Ha-ha.</br></p>", "8341": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends. At a certain point, you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting.</p>", "8342": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, then we're gonna have to go with an oldie but goodie, making a scene.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't think I'd be good at that.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's why you're lucky to have me. Back in Omaha, there are two different restaurants I'm not allowed into. Both Chili's.</p>", "8343": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Bernadette, remember, your character's the healer in our group. You're in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I can't help it. My Howie Wowie has an owie.</p>", "8344": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That is the most sickeningly sweet thing I have ever experienced. And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.</p>", "8345": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> (Storming into the apartment) Sheldon Cooper, I've got a bone to pick with you, and I'm about to do it in front of all your friends.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm gonna publicly shame you, and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behavior.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, burn!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> And if you don't start treating me better, I'm leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named Armin.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Armin who?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Armin ... damn it.</p>", "8346": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family, and you stood her up, okay? Look at this adorable, smushy face. Smush, smush, smush, smush.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You're hurting me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, Sheldon hurt you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Before; now it's you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh.</p>", "8347": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think I understand. You're the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you can't lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, she doesn't want your stupid\u2026<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Ooh, Science Center. Redeeming. Let's go.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler. Let me get my coat. (Whip sound) Oh, grow up, Leonard.</p>", "8348": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> And that's how a girl makes a scene. I'm sorry, sweetie. You're right. You deserve your weekend. Come on, Amy, let's go.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What about the Science Center?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'll let you hold my hair while I throw up.</p>", "8349": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, dear. Mr D'Onofrio's in the hospital. Why do these things always happen to me?</p>", "8350": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, it's okay. He can do it. He's a barber.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He's not a barber, he's the nephew. He's an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry. Besides, Mr. D'Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas.</p>", "8351": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When I first moved here, I was nervous about finding a new barber, so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to Mr. D'Onofrio.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> There's no such thing as haircut records.</p>", "8352": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> To paraphrase T.S. Eliot, this is the way the word ends, not with a bang but with a nephew.</p>", "8353": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I feel like a teen heartthrob.</p>", "8354": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What about Supercuts?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I tried once. They do men and women's hair in the same room at the same time. It's like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.</p>", "8355": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, Sheldon, sometimes it's nice not knowing what's coming. I mean, look at me and Leonard. We went out, we broke up, now we're trying again. We don't know what's gonna happen.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, please, everyone knows what's going to happen.</br></p>", "8356": "<p><strong>Althea:</strong> Can I help you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. Do you have something I could use as a cape?<br/><strong>Althea:</strong> Oh, dear. Did we spit out our pills, slip out of the ninth floor, and go on a little adventure?</p>", "8357": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hang on, uh, uh, roommate agreement. Ha! Um, no hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets after 10:00 p.m.</p>", "8358": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sorry, Sheldon, I'll move out of your spot.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why? My spot, your spot; what difference does it make?</p>", "8359": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you gonna do first?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know. I could do anything. All bets are off. The world is my oyster. *slams hand on table* I got it. I'm gonna put on my Tuesday pajamas tonight.</p>", "8360": "<p><strong>Barber:</strong> I can cut it for you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're not Mr. D'Onofrio. I get my hair cut by Mr. D'Onofrio. *to Leonard* Can you believe this guy?</p>", "8361": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship...<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Were not friends.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that's a little hard to hear, but all right.</p>", "8362": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> How about you decide this with Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> What the frig is that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. All hail Sam Kass.</p>", "8363": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey! He did that on purpose,<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, he didn't. Nothing that's happening here is being done on purpose. Okay, uh, forget one-on-one. Let's try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Making it too easy there, Hofstadter.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. No, I'm not.</p>", "8364": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, what a great movie.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I cannot believe you've never seen Grease.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> My mother didn't allow me to watch it. She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.</p>", "8365": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I've got to go. I've got to get up early. My company's testing a new steroid that supposedly doesn't shrink testicles, and the last one there has to do the measuring.</p>", "8366": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah, the spoils. I see why victors love them.</p>", "8367": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm so humiliated. I sat there the whole time that we were watching Grease, thinking you liked the painting.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I was a fool from Summer Lovin' to the very last rama lamma lamma ka dinga da dinga dong.</p>", "8368": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes, too much. Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. I clearly like you more than you like me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't think you can put a number on how much one person likes another.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I bought you a painting, that's 12 square feet in area. There's a number.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Amy, come on...<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> If you don't like feet, you can try dollars. The painting set me back three grand.</p>", "8369": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, look, I didn't want to say this, but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, my goodness, how could I have not seen that? The painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool.</p>", "8370": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Why don't you just turn up the thermostat?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aha! Good question. It turns out the thermostat for my new office isn't in my new office. No. It's next door in Professor Davenport's office, who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause.</br></p>", "8371": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why is there a hole here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why is there a hole in my new office? I've narrowed it down to two possibilities: There was something in the wall that someone outside the wall wanted, or the more disturbing, there was something in the wall that wanted out.</p>", "8372": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, at least you finally got a window that opens. That's nice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is it? Listen.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What, you don't like wind chimes?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I hate them, but it gets worse. There it is.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The bird?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, It's completely out of tune with the wind chimes.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You don't get it, do you? That's a mockingbird. Mockingbirds can change their song, which means he's out of tune on purpose. He's mocking me.</p>", "8373": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The vibration. We are directly underneath the geology lab, and they're running their confounded sieve shakers again. Hey, gravel monkeys, if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!</p>", "8374": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, relax.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes, and birds, and wind, and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If you're not happy, why don't you just let Kripke have the office?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What, and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? </p>", "8375": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We're trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys! </p>", "8376": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, look, there's Rothman's empty office. Sad.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mm, indeed.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So sad.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Dibs.</p>", "8377": "<p>Kripke: What's up, fellas?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What are you doing here, Kripke?<br/>\nKripke: Ah, measuring my new office for drapes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is not your office. It hasn't been assigned yet.<br/>\nKripke: Well, I called dibs at the Christmas party when Professor Rothman tried to have intercourse with the toys for tots collection box.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Dibs? This is a university, not a playground. Offices are not assigned because someone called dibs.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You just called dibs.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Shut it. Offices are assigned by seniority. I arrived at the university first.<br/>\nKripke: I arrived at the office first. I'm the proverbial early bird.</p>", "8378": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (Looking at the painting Amy bought Penny) That is big.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So big.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> And ugly.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So ugly.</p>", "8379": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What am I gonna do?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't know. You can't take it down. You'll break her heart. Look at that face. That enormous, unsettling, crazy face.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Is there any chance I'll learn to love it?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That depends. Do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?</p>", "8380": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, it's got to go.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What will you tell Amy?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> How about I tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you're not in it?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one? I already have a picture of me and Howard's mom getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach. I've suffered enough.</p>", "8381": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Would you look at this? I paid twenty five dollars to some kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand. He sent me a stick. He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's numbered.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ooh, limited edition. Nice.</p>", "8382": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's he doing here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We're going to work this office situation out like gentlemen. And if that doesn't work, I'm going to poison his tea.</p>", "8383": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Cooper.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Kripke, come in. I'm making tea. Would you like a cup?<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Am I weawing a summer frock? No, I don't want tea. Let's get down to brass tacks.</p>", "8384": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Gentlemen, I think I've come up with a fun way to get young people interested in science. Physics Mad-Libs. Now, give me a number.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Five.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh-huh. And an irrational constant.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> E.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And a funny Greek letter.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Gamma.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I said funny.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Upsilon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good one. And an electrical charge.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Positive.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a ... (laughs uncontrollably) ... Okay. No, no. I'll start over. Professor ... (laughs again).</p>", "8385": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I haven't seen him laugh that hard since the day Leonard made that multiplication error.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Oh, Lord, that multiplication error! He thought he carried the one. But he didn't.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not funny. That mistake got published.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Stop! I'm going to wet myself!</br></p>", "8386": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, guys, guys, President Siebert is headed this way.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I wonder what he wants.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Doesn't look happy, so I'm guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon.<br/><strong>President Siebert:</strong> Dr. Cooper?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Told ya.</p>", "8387": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, President Siebert, I assume you'd like to respond to one of the suggestions I put in the box by your office.<br/><strong>President Siebert:</strong> No, and stop installing suggestion boxes everywhere.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You don't like written suggestions. You don't like when I give them to you while we're urinating in the men's room. If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you're one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions.</p>", "8388": "<p><strong>President Siebert:</strong> Dr. Cooper, the physics department chair tells me you're refusing to take your vacation.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't need a vacation.<br/><strong>President Siebert:</strong> You're obligated to take one. And I'd also like you to know the most-often received suggestion in my suggestion box you installed without asking me is can Dr. Cooper take a vacation?</p>", "8389": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm so glad you talked Howard out of having your wedding invitations in Klingon.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Turn it over. I'm hoping my relatives think it's Hebrew.</p>", "8390": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> This is really happening. I'm gonna be a maid of honour. I'm gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle and, finally, I will have my special day.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You mean my special day?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> They're gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody's head.</p>", "8391": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Parental pressure can be daunting. I remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs. Last year, I finally gave in and let her do it.</p>", "8392": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new. In fact, the term wed referred to the money and livestock that the groom paid the bride's father. For example, you're adorable, intelligent and a good earner. I could conservatively see you going for at least two oxen and a goose. (To Penny) You would fetch a unicorn.</p>", "8393": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> How about Florida? They've got Cape Canaveral, they've got Disney, they've got my Aunt Ida and the world's largest collection of diabetic candy. Plus, if you get sweaty enough, her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My family took a trip to Florida when I was a child. A seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach. I got the message.</p>", "8394": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's like I'm living in a dictatorship. You must take a vacation, you must have fun, you must enjoy life.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't think you have a good handle on dictatorships.</p>", "8395": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, everybody takes vacations.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation, but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new. He went to work in his friends biology lab. Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist, part of the Manhattan Project.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now you do, too.</p>", "8396": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh! I have a brilliant idea. Amy's a biologist. I'll go work in her lab.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Isn't that just Feynmans idea?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ten seconds ago, you never heard of him. Now you're an expert.</p>", "8397": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is that your laundry? You only have, like, six things in there.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I didn't have any quarters, so I've been sneaking stuff into other people's loads all day.</p>", "8398": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once in a while, I think about how I didn't leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes.</p>", "8399": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Joke all you want, but you think about it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Good luck catching a man with that attitude.</p>", "8400": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. Screw Beauty and the Beast, that's the love story Disney should tell.</p>", "8401": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where's Howard?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> No hi, Raj? No how are you, Raj? Just straight to where's the other white guy?</br></p>", "8402": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, listen, I heard something about him. Can you keep it between us?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ooh, gossip. When I first got here, I thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler. So I hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler.</p>", "8403": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Bernadette wants to get a pre-nup.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, that's a shame, he's gonna be devastated.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I never know what to do in these situations. Should I give him a heads-up?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hmm. I'm gonna give you the same advice I yell at the TV when the Bachelor's handing out roses. Follow your heart.</p>", "8404": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You know what, it's not a big deal. She makes more money than me. She wants to protect her financial interests. It's completely reasonable.<br/>\nLeonard; Good. That's a healthy attitude.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, actually, it's good for both of us. I have assets to protect, too.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Like what?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I've got some rare comic books. The Vespa's almost paid off. And Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mount Sinai right near the guy who played Mr. Roper on Three's Company.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Mr. Roper's dead? You can't just spring that on a guy.</p>", "8405": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Those are perfectly clean.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis. If it is, in fact, perfectly clean, drink from it.</p>", "8406": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> 366, 367<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> How's it going?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How's counting going? When I was in kindergarten, I recited Pi to a thousand places for the school talent show. I think I got this.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Great.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aw, nuts! One</p>", "8407": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is preposterous. I think you're giving me these tasks because you're afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do, I'll show you up.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Really? Is that what you think?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, that's what I think. And I'm super smart, so it's probably true.</p>", "8408": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, I've been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. You've been here for three hours, and you've spent one of them in the bathroom.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry. It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.</p>", "8409": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I've given you the simplest things to do, and you haven't done one of them right.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Maybe that's because I'm not being challenged. It's the same reason Einstein failed math.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Maybe the math was too bubbly for him.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You think you're doing science by cutting up that brain? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos. And they'd offer to toast it for me, too.</p>", "8410": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, smart guy. I'm about to remove the locus coeruleus, which is incredibly delicate work. Have at it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right. I'm no stranger to a little gray matter. Locus coeruleus. Locus coeruleus.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You're getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain. Hope your hands are steady. It's the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so I'm sure it's no problem for a genius like you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not. I'll have you know, in the field of physics, we work with particles so small, they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus, i.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house, it sits around the house.</p>", "8411": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No. But your thumb does.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, dear. (Faints)</p>", "8412": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What happened to your thumb?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, I have ten fingers and ten toes. If I tell you a story about each one of them, we'll be here all day, let's just move on.</p>", "8413": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah, seeing as I'm on vacation, a pina colada seems appropriate. Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum. Don't let me have too many of those.</p>", "8414": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory. After all, I did book the whole week.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was not myself. I had lost a lot of thumb blood.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's not an apology.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That is your opinion.</p>", "8415": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I want a real apology.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Im sorry that you weren't able to..<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That my genius...<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That the soap was...<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. Sorry.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You're forgiven.</br></p>", "8416": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong>  Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers. They're still dirty from yesterday.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Next year I'm going to Epcot.</p>", "8417": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Emergency drill night last night, huh?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh-huh.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How'd you do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll tell you exactly how he did. Readiness: unsatisfactory. Follows direction: barely. Attitude: a little too much. Overall: not only will he probably die in a fiery inferno, his incessant whining would most certainly spoil everyone else's day.</p>", "8418": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know what, I'm so tired I can't even think straight. I'm going home. Will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You can't go home. You have to take me to the dentist at four o'clock.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, can't you take the bus to the dentist?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course I can. It's coming back under the residual effects of the anesthesia, that's the problem. Two years ago after a deep gum cleaning, I thought I got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> They put you under for a cleaning?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, they have to, I'm a biter.</p>", "8419": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Whatever, Sheldon. I'm exhausted. I'm not taking you to the dentist.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under section 37B of the roommate agreement, miscellaneous duties, you are obligated to take me to the dentist. See? It's right here after providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know what, I am sick of the roommate agreement. It's ridiculous. I'm your roommate, not your chauffeur. You know, I had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena has gotten too big for its britches.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, it has. Ask anybody.</p>", "8420": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howard doesn't make me do his shopping, or take him to the dentist, or pick up his dry cleaning, right?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Absolutely. But when Ma's hips give out, you're up, kid.</p>", "8421": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, if Amy's too busy, that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier, thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs, tentatively entitled \"You're Welcome, Mankind\". All right, then, just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake. Uh, dentist. Okay, we can circle back to that one. Um, well, who wants to take me Wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes? Anyone? Oh. That one had hoot written all over it. Um, all right, uh, dermatologist? Allergist? Podiatrist? Supercuts? Okay, okay, here's a fun one. Um, I need a new picture frame and I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs. Who wants to spend the day with me at IKEA?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Their meatballs are pretty good.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's that?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Nothing, nothing.</p>", "8422": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, Stuart.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, hey, Sheldon. Can I help you find something today?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, no. I was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favorite person.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Ninth?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You moved up one. My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates.</p>", "8423": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> On a cheerier note, I have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon. What do you say you take me over there, buddy boy?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'm sorry, you want me to take you to the dentist?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. And now, I can't make any promises, but that's the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Sheldon, I'm working. I can't take you to the dentist. Also, and I can't stress this enough, I don't want to take you to the dentist.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can't help a friend out in a time of need, huh? I see where your therapist was coming from.</p>", "8424": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not necessary. No. I found a service that'll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning. Mostly they cater to dogs, but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind.</p>", "8425": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you suggesting that you've come to your senses and wish to re-establish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the roommate agreement?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Absolutely. If you admit that you're a 30-year-old man who's incapable of functioning on his own.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ooh, Sock Mouth's got him on the ropes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I will admit nothing of the sort. And now if you'll excuse me, I have to call my dentist and see if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped.</p>", "8426": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, good, your power's out, too.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why is that good?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Because last month, I sent the electric company a Starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra.</p>", "8427": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Power failure. Implementing power-failure protocol.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic. Anyway, it's too bad you\u2019re no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship, because I happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency. Please try not to see anything by this light. It's not for you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's just a blackout, I'm sure the power will be back on soon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And I'm sure some fool in the Donner party said the snow would stop any day now. I like to think they ate him first.</p>", "8428": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Since when don\u2019t you knock? It's like the only good thing about you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Social niceties have been suspended, Leonard. We're in a state of a emergency. The world has descended into darkened turmoil. Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day.</p>", "8429": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fine, what is it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm making s'mores. I wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> S'mores, huh? Good for you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, thanks. I'm good.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? Huh! Okay. In that case, I will have a s'more by myself. And then I'm gonna have s'more. By myself.</p>", "8430": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid. I don't see why we can't be friends. And I'm willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. I just don't want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What are you proposing?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That we go back to the way things were. But when I do something for you, you show a little appreciation.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And how would I do that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You say thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Every time?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not crazy.</br></p>", "8431": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Counter-proposal. We reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum, in the spirit of Mother's Day or Father's Day, once a year, we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life, both actual and imagined by you. We could call it Leonard's Day.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I kind of like the sound of that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course you do. It's about you, like everything else. [lights come back on] Oh, thank goodness. I don't think I had it in me to make another glass of water.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard's Day?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can I sit in your spot?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can I control the thermostat?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do I get a card?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course you get a card. It's Leonard's Day.</p>", "8432": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, guys, the building manager said the reason the power went out is someone went down into the basement and just pulled the main breaker switch.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really. Who do you think did that, Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I don't know. But whoever that mystery man was, you should be eternally grateful, for without him, there would be no Leonard's Day.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard's Day?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no pressure. Just get him a crummy card, you're good.</p>", "8433": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why do you think he asked you out again?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't know.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Maybe he's dying. That would be so romantic.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> He's not dying.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Too bad. If he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines.</p>", "8434": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Do you think you'll sleep with him tonight?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Absolutely not. Look, we're just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> If he were dying, would you sleep with him?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Assuming he were dying of something that couldn't be sexually transmitted. You know, like a spear wound to the head.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, he is not dying.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> How do you know? Are you a doctor?</p>", "8435": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You can make-believe, though. Sometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and I'm a sexy cardiologist. And the naughty part is I'm not in his HMO network.</p>", "8436": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Relax, you know Leonard's always been crazy about you. It's gonna be great.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know, but we've finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. And what if something goes wrong? Then what?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Guess it'll just be Sheldon and me going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sure, we'd love that. (To Penny) Change your clothes, we got a lot riding on this.</p>", "8437": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't understand the laughter. The object of Settlers of Catan is to build roads and settlements. To do so requires wood. Now, I have sheep. I need wood. Who has wood for my sheep?</p>", "8438": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The reason you're fixated on a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that she's the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment, your brilliant yet intimidating mother.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where on earth did you get that from?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's in her book, \"Needy Baby, Greedy Baby\".<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That doesn't make it true.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's called non-fiction for a reason, Leonard.</p>", "8439": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> If they ever make a movie version of that book, you know who should play Leonard's mother? Sandra Bullock.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Because she's great in everything.</p>", "8440": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's a good question. How about awkward?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, that sounds right.</p>", "8441": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, how about if we pretend we're actually on a first date? See how that goes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, Polly, tell me about yourself.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's Penny.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward.</p>", "8442": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, uh, let's see. I'm from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, I've done a hemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. So, you know, dreams do come true.</p>", "8443": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, let's see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I've just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow. Can they?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, God, no. The money's pretty good. And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal.</p>", "8444": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You are so funny.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.</p>", "8445": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You said always. You'll always have feelings for me.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, that sounds more like something you'd say if you didn't want a relationship with someone. This isn't working out, but I'll always have feelings for you. I'm sorry I slept with your best friend, but I'll always have feelings for you. Here's the thing, Lisa, I'm into dudes now, but I'll always have feelings for you.</br></p>", "8446": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You're over-thinking this.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I'm not.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes, you are. You always over-think things.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ah, now there you go. Always made it worse.</p>", "8447": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> See, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I don't know how you have a relationship without talking.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months. We never talked. To this day, I don't even know what TJ stands for.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait, if you guys didn't talk, what did you ... Never mind, stupid question.</p>", "8448": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, that was fun.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You hung in there, though.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, there was a lot at stake.</p>", "8449": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, I just remembered. I still got one of your inhalers.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can't believe you kept this.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn't.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That is so sweet. In 25 to 30 minutes I'm gonna show you how much this means to me.</p>", "8450": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hang on a second, mister.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's customary when using the rest room at a retail establishment to make a small purchase. Did you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Here's two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't want beef jerky.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not about you. It's about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fine.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed.</p>", "8451": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard will be here in a moment. He's looking for a different parking space.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker, and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out, I'd be obligated to do so.</p>", "8452": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm so disappointed it didn't work with him and Penny.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Me, too. Out of deference to them, let's not flaunt our happy relationship.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You have a keen insight into the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler.</p>", "8453": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We are next to a Subaru with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I doubt they'd want to talk about that, so we're fine.</p>", "8454": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> No, that's okay, Bernadette. Sometimes these things just don't work out.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, it's all good. We'll always have feelings for each other.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, that's nice.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> See, she knew what always meant.</p>", "8455": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> People, people, please, before you say something you both regret, I'd like to place my order.</p>", "8456": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know why we can't be together? Because you always have to be right.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, that is not true.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've got to go with Leonard on this. He is wrong more than anyone I know.</p>", "8457": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over, you will not start a complicated on-again, off-again relationship with her, because I am very, very hungry.</p>", "8458": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> If you and Leonard get back together, Sheldon and I will finally have someone to go on double dates with.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What about me and Howard?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Fine, we can double with you, too. So insecure.</p>", "8459": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Look, I made Sheldon disappear. Ta-da.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Next time, you should lead with that.</p>", "8460": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, look who's out on a date. Pasadena's favorite power couple, Shamy.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory.</br></p>", "8461": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, what is wrong with you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I don't know what it is, but when they start munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside.</p>", "8462": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Buy her something.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How does that work?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it.</p>", "8463": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> But don't you think it will be different when the child is ours?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Right, when it's our kid that has ruined my body, and kept me up all night, and I've got no career and no future, and nothing to be happy about for the next twenty years. Sure, that'll be completely different.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, yeah.</p>", "8464": "<p><strong>Shop Assistant:</strong> Are we looking for anything special? Perhaps a ring for the lady?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (Snorts) Trust me, we are not a couple.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me. I don't see why you get to snort derisively and point that out. You'd be lucky to land a fella like me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Fine, go ahead.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Snorts) Trust me, we are not a couple.</p>", "8465": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe me and Bernadette aren't right for each other.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, Howard, I'd say there's a lot of fish in the sea, but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. Do not throw her back.</p>", "8466": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Completely empty box. If you'd like to examine it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Little snarky there, cello lessons.</p>", "8467": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> And we have this completely ordinary cylinder. If you'd like to examine it?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ordinary, yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret.</p>", "8468": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm telling you, dude, there's a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it.</p>", "8469": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is how you're going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> How is this lying?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. You've chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Can't you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats, then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion.</p>", "8470": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Look, I made Sheldon disappear. Ta-da.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Next time, you should open with that.</p>", "8471": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, are we celebrating anything special tonight?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, yes. Our relationship agreement specifies that the second Thursday of every month, or the third Thursday in a month with five Thursdays, is date night.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That is so hot.</p>", "8472": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ooh! Speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That's nice. Anyway, I've been dreaming of this day for a long time.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, me, too. Triple digits, I'm not gonna lie, feels pretty good.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I'm the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ooh, 101! Air's getting a bit thin up here.</p>", "8473": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I see why you're confused. No, her news sounded important, but what you're forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. That's all about yucky, squishy things.</p>", "8474": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Honey, she's upset. You're her boyfriend. You have to at least try to be excited by the things she's excited by.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What if they simply don't excite me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, just smile and think about koalas.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She'd see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference, it's this.</p>", "8475": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, you have a lot of magic stuff.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah. I started when I was a teenager. I thought I could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Did it work?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Ah, let's just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one.</br></p>", "8476": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How come you're not doing a mission? You're just wandering around.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Had a rough night. I thought I'd go for a walk and clear my head.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Some people go outside and do that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's after nine o'clock, at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats.</p>", "8477": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Glad I could help.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again, I'll be glad to return the favor.</p>", "8478": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong>  Ooh, does she like bracelets?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, she's very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. Maybe they have a dressier version of that?</p>", "8479": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it. I always thought I'd be a dad someday.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, me, too. You're so caring. I've often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> There you go, Howard. Sounds like Raj'll have your babies, problem solved.</p>", "8480": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What's your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Huh, it'll kill her. On the other hand, if I don't give her grandchildren, that'll kill her, too. So, either way, on the Mom front, I'm golden.</p>", "8481": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What time did you tell Amy to be here?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Eight o'clock. (Sheldon checks his pocket watch) Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nonsense. I look like a train conductor.</p>", "8482": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Under what pretext did you lure her here?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I said, hey, want to come over and hang out?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good, good, if you had said something clever, she might've gotten suspicious.</p>", "8483": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Congratulations? The Newcomb Medal? Oh, please. That's the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework.</p>", "8484": "<p><strong>Jimmy Speckerman:</strong> Aw, come on, you can figure it out. You're like the smartest guy I've ever know.<br/><br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The smartest? All right, you know, I may not have the firmest grip on sarcasm, but even I know that was a doozey.</p>", "8485": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasn't the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it.</p>", "8486": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay. If you can't get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe that you're capable of great change. Like when I finally got you to stop saying Valentime's Day.</p>", "8487": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You want to hear something weird?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you talking about?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. I thought it was a game.</p>", "8488": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. An e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to Sweet Georgia Brown. Pick.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just do it, 'cause he's not gonna let it go.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Basketball Pope.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And thats how it's done.</p>", "8489": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I told you. That was a different guy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hmm. That's too bad. We could have spent New Year's Eve waiting for the ball to drop.</p>", "8490": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's two a.m. What are you doing up?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.</br></p>", "8491": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look at these men. They've managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose. You should pay attention, Leonard. Someday this could be you up there.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thanks.</p>", "8492": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Its this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can't decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wear loafers.</p>", "8493": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel Prize. What's the matter, Saul? You afraid someone's going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein's cosmological constant?</p>", "8494": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, now Perlmutter's shaking the King's hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf. He might have lifted it.</p>", "8495": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. I'm gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school. You know, \"Pick on someone your own size. You did not have sex with my mother. And yes, I do know why I'm hitting myself.\"</p>", "8496": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I love this dress. How come I never see you wear it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> 'cause when I wear it, it's a shirt.</p>", "8497": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> When Leonard gets back, Id love to check his serotonin levels. Do you think he'd let me draw a syringe full of his blood?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hmm, he's not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, it'll just pour out of his nose.</p>", "8498": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> That's nothing. In ninth grade, the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion. Within six months, the nicknames began to fly. I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow. You poor thing.</p>", "8499": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Who would have thought Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What? I was not a bully.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Kind of sounds like you were. And maybe a felon.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Shh. That's how you wind up in a cornfield.</p>", "8500": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, we're here to support you, buddy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, you're not. You're here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You wore underwear? You fool.</p>", "8501": "<p>Jimmy Speckerman: Wow. Look at you. Little Leonard Hofstadter. I hear you're a big-time scientist now.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And there's the first zinger. Ouch.</p>", "8502": "<p>Jimmy Speckerman: From what I read, it sounded like a big deal.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, good Lord, are we going to stand here and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My point.</p>", "8503": "<p>Jimmy Speckerman: Okay. What do you think about a pair of glasses that makes any movie you want into 3D?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That sounds amazing. First movie I'm watching, Annie.</p>", "8504": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The man Super Glued Hershey's Kisses to your nipples.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's funny because those aren't the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.</p>", "8505": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> (On the phone) Anyway, I'm really sorry I made fun of your stutter in high school.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're doing great.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, God, just finish the sentence. Okay, well, I'm sorry you feel that way. Bye. No one wants to hear my apologies.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I think your mistake is doing it over the phone. If they could look into your eyes, they'd melt.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Penny, it doesn't matter what you did in the past. You're a good person now.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's easy for you to say. You weren't just called a b-b-b-b-bitch.</br></p>", "8506": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism. ... Which word's tripping you up? Assuage or altruism?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Both.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You'll feel better by doing something nice for someone.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I actually knew that.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I never doubted you.</p>", "8507": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Every other week I serve at a soup kitchen downtown.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, I can't do that. If I stand over a steaming pot, my hair just goes boing! What else could I do?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> There's Habitat for Humanity, building houses for the poor.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, come on, I don't even have my own house, I'm going to build one for someone else?</p>", "8508": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How about donating some of your clothes?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, my God, that's perfect. 'cause I have so many clothes I don't wear, and they're just taking up space, and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I have no place to put it. This will totally fix that.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What about helping people?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And helping people.</p>", "8509": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Here's your cocoa.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Heated to precisely 183 degrees?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You got one for good luck. (Knock on door) I'll get it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.</p>", "8510": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> How about that? After all these years, your big bad high school bully finally apologizes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know what would be nice?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Whats that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who've tormented us for years, we open our home to Jimmy and once he's asleep, we kill him. ... I said it would be nice, I didn't say we should do it.</p>", "8511": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Ah, I feel just like Mother Teresa. Except for the virgin part. That ship sailed a long time ago.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I think Mother Teresa would have washed the clothes first.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room wasn't down five flights of stairs. You know, giving really is better than receiving. I used to think it was such a clich\u00e9, but it seems to be the\u2026 oh, look at these cute jeans someone just threw away.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Donated.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut.</p>", "8512": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The Dark Knight has your back. He's scared, but he has your back.</p>", "8513": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, wait, wait, guys, just hang on.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What is it, the fuzz?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Look at us. What are we doing?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I was gleefully following you to a life of crime, looking forward to the day we might be cell mates. I don\u2019t know about Bernadette.</p>", "8514": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, this is wrong. Let's put everything back. Here.<br/>\nBernadette (taking boots and running): It's okay, I serve soup to poor people!</p>", "8515": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. I've got eight pounds of salmon that's about to go bad. Do you know how to cook it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not really.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Damn it. Should have liberated the iffy chicken.</p>", "8516": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I'm going to take myself out to a movie tonight. You want to go?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? Do we do that?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What do you mean?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, we haven't spent time alone together since we broke up.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, it's not a date, Leonard. It's just a man and a woman hanging out, and not having sex at the end of the night.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sounds like most of my dates.</p>", "8517": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> [inside the apartment] Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> [in the hallway] What is that about?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, he's smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster.</p>", "8518": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I'm at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah, I'd like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. I'm sorry, this is Animal Control. I don't understand the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you're frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because you're stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Don't you think I tried making cat noises?</p>", "8519": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, yeah, sure. There's also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston, and she's not building a dam.</p>", "8520": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Does this sound familiar? I'd love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? It's great. It's two a.m., of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldn't?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, we were going out. You were going to get sex anyway.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No. No woman would.</br></p>", "8521": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> See? Now, that's the great thing. We're out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So, let's go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert.</p>", "8522": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I have a Masters degree from M.I.T.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, but you've got a can-do attitude and that's what's important.</p>", "8523": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. Age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. Age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. Need I go on?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes, please. This is way better than the movie.</p>", "8524": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, you enjoyed the movie. I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, I was thinking how come they get to leave and I can't.</p>", "8525": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm going to get some fries. You want anything?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, no, thanks.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I just eat the little crispy ones you don't like.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I love them. I save them for the end, but they're gone because you ate them. And why did I let you eat them?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> To get sex.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Exactly.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, I'd like an order of fries.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Great. That'll be five dollars. I am having the best time. I'm so glad you suggested we do this.</p>", "8526": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You didn't see me telling Kevin that you thought Cold Wars were only fought in Winter</p>", "8527": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren't on a date.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, I'm talking to him because hes cute.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, he's not that cute.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes, he is. With his dorky T-shirt and his little hipster glasses.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes, but when you're tall and have great cheekbones, you're doing it ironically.</p>", "8528": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Then I'll return the favor and I won't tell...<br/><strong>Laura:</strong> Laura-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated.</p>", "8529": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're biologists. Biology is the study of living things. That's a living thing, get cracking.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I specialize in microorganisms, and Amy studies brains.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, come now. Your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class.</p>", "8530": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. Just like you did with the mailman.</p>", "8531": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. I'm not going to be another statistic.</p>", "8532": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> When you were telling Kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?</p>", "8533": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? He's magnificent. Oh, dear. I just realized I haven't offered you a beverage.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, it's just like my grandma with her parrot. And after she lost her marbles with her remote control.</p>", "8534": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay. So, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in all, a pretty magical night.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, I'm not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumb ass.</p>", "8535": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, if you dont mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great.</br></p>", "8536": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Girlfriends, I have the answer to our dress problems.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Twelve years ago, my cousin Irene and her entire family died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before her wedding.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's horrible.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes and no. All those bridesmaids dresses remain unused and available to us for free. So it seems that cloud of odourless deadly gas had a silver lining after all. Check it out, still in the bags. The gowns, not the bridesmaids.</p>", "8537": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I dont know. Dead people's dresses?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, and cap sleeves?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I was hoping you wouldn't notice. Irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes, and sadly as it turned out, space heaters.</p>", "8538": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ladies, please. These four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach. But through no one's fault, Penny, the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined. And again, I'm looking at no one in particular, Penny.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fine. What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> \"What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?\" Why do you hate us?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, that time you looked at me.</p>", "8539": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Topic one. Faster-than-light particles at CERN, paradigm-shifting discovery or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese? And converse.</p>", "8540": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, Amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious, and yet somehow you do it.</p>", "8541": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Can we get that off the table and change the subject?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can we? Stand back while I turn this conversation into a conver-sensation.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> This time, it's your fault.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have 100 alphabetized topics from \"Artichoke, come on, people, it's just a giant thistle\" to \"ZZZ, the onamona-poetry of sleep\".</p>", "8542": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't know, four or five years.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, it's not gonna do it.</p>", "8543": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Leonard's coming down the home stretch. Come on, horsey, you can do this Damn. Come on, thigh muscles, you can do this. Yes, first place! I would have been a great jockey if I weren't too tall. And scared of horses.</p>", "8544": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, what are you doing here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You didn't respond to any of my electronic communications.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I wanted to be alone.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would you like to talk about it? And keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer.</p>", "8545": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Point of order. As you're in distress, it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. But I'm a guest in your home, so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?</p>", "8546": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm thinking about adopting some quirky affectation, like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> For all those girls out there looking for the Indian Monopoly man?</p>", "8547": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Where's Sheldon?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, he was up late last night, so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's so sweet.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, but now he's gonna be up at dawn and want to play.</p>", "8548": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he proposed answering it with \"ahoy\"?</p>", "8549": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You see, I used to be a jackass, but I stopped myself. I became a good guy. See, that's kind of my superpower. I'm like Captain Good Guy!<br/>\n(Alice pushes him out, then slams door)<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's okay. Did the right thing. *tightens his jacket* You idiot!<br/></p>", "8550": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow!</p>", "8551": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And reverse the spin on the anti-proton, and gamma becomes alpha multiplied by a matrix of I comma zero.\n\nAnd there we have it, conclusive proof that I am absolutely useless after nine o'clock.</p>", "8552": "<p>(After Sheldon passes out after the Halloween prank)\n<br><strong>Howard:</strong> who had there money on faint?\n<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I had pee his pants.\n<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hang on, looks like everyone's a winner.</br></p>", "8553": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, they don't have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mm. Tough decision. There's no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just Bilbo Baggins' sword over there.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Two grown men with a hobbit's dagger; wouldn't we look silly?</p>", "8554": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. It's okay, I guess.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay? It's magnificent.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, it's hard to put a price on something thats a copy of something that was on pay cable. But for my friends, let's say 250?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, that's pretty steep.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, it's a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of these bad boys.</p>", "8555": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Only 8,000? We're wasting precious time. Buy it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hang on. Can you do any better?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Are you kidding? I'm already giving you the friends and family discount.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, did you hear that? We're getting the friends and family discount. We are honored and we will take it.</p>", "8556": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Two hundred.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Man, you're killing me!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Killing you? I can't breathe.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Two ten, and I'm losing money.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, now, we can't let him lose money, Leonard. I'm so sorry.</p>", "8557": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Are you crazy? That helmet's signed by Robert Downey Jr.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Okay, if you're going to question the importance of an actor's signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book, then all of our lives have no meaning!</p>", "8558": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Thank you. I can eat meat this week.</p>", "8559": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> You want me to wrap it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, it's okay. I'm gonna stab my friend in the chest.</p>", "8560": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, Wil Wheaton.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not surprised.</p>", "8561": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Here's the Batman 612 with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Awesome. What do I owe you?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Forty bucks.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Good deal.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sucker. Didn't even ask for the friends and family discount.</p>", "8562": "<p>Wil: Hey, I'm having a party at my house on Friday, and I was hoping you would stop by.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Will there be girls there?<br/>\nWil: Yeah, of course.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> 'cause there wasn't last time.<br/>\nWil: There will be girls.</p>", "8563": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I see what you're doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we're going to be there, and when we don't show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I was actually thinking about going.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it.</p>", "8564": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, can you grab me a water?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Possibly.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can you or can't you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not that simple, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It never is, is it?</p>", "8565": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Got it. Can I have my water?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course. (Knocking Leonard's bottle of water away) Now get it yourself, you traitor.</br></p>", "8566": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'd like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard's making that a reality. We're all very proud of you.<br/><strong>Everybody:</strong> Cheers.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That was a lovely toast. Kudos.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clichs. You sicken me.</p>", "8567": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You're really quiet. Is everything okay?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Fine. Just a little tired.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I hope not too tired, because I'm feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I always catch your drift.</p>", "8568": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, well, something's obviously bugging you. What is it?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I just can't believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, I get it. You're worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there's a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Just stop talking, Howard.</p>", "8569": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> This isn't the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What did you think was going to happen?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Honestly? Sex.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howard!</p>", "8570": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honor it is to be chosen to go into space?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We're supposed to be partners. We're supposed to be a team.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm sorry. You're right. Okay, let's try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I'd like to discuss it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I've been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, we're a team. So, what do you think?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No.</p>", "8571": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Pretty cool about Howard, huh?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Dont talk to me as if nothing's happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> For God's sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You never stop talking, do you?</p>", "8572": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?<br/><strong>Everybody:</strong> Oh!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton's character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares.<br/>\nOh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list.</p>", "8573": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, what's gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. If we're going to get back together, she's going to have to apologize and accept that I'm a grown man who can make his own decisions.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Then she's going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Obviously.</p>", "8574": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, that, that's good. I'm glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I do, with all my heart.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Got it. Just had to check.</p>", "8575": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, Sheldon, we're going to Wil's. This is your last chance.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you're going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers.</p>", "8576": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Brent Spiner?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't care.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I did, but I think I've kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.</p>", "8577": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> If you're gonna love me, you're gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I know.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, don't say it if you're not gonna mean it, 'cause I'm not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I want to go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars. I want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Really? You got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, those big kids were rocking it.</p>", "8578": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I just did what I did because I love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're my soul mate. This is where you kiss me.</p>", "8579": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you doing here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be, you're still my little buddy. I'm not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, let's meet Brent Spiner and go home.</p>", "8580": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Hey, Sheldon, I'm so glad you made it. I found something I think you might like.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What I'd like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely.</br></p>", "8581": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> This is for you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> I remembered your story about the time you went to a convention when you were a kid to get one signed, and I didn't show up.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Look at what I wrote.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> It's my last one. I want you to have it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!</p>", "8582": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can we get autographed dolls?<br/><strong>Brent Spiner:</strong> Sure. Twenty bucks.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ten.<br/><strong>Brent Spiner:</strong> Eighteen.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Twelve.<br/><strong>Brent Spiner:</strong> Sixteen.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.<br/><strong>Brent Spiner:</strong> Done.</p>", "8583": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's from Game of Thrones. What do you think?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know. If we're going to start a fantasy sworld collection, and I've long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What did you have in mind?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, off the top of my head, I'd have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It would be a replica of a movie prop.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fair enough. It'd give you the right to rule a replica of England.</p>", "8584": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist and guess who that someone is.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mohammed Lee.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Who's Mohammed Lee?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mohammed is the most common first name in the world. Lee, the most common surname. As I didn't know the answer, I thought it gave me the mathematical edge.</p>", "8585": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You're not only our first astronaut, you're also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You're like a rockstar.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Little bit.</p>", "8586": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I had no choice. I had to tell his mother. He can't go to space. He's like a baby bird. Do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?</p>", "8587": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, God, you're right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother.</p>", "8588": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, Mummy, Daddy. What a nice surprise.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> No, it's not a nice surprise, it's a bad surprise.</p>", "8589": "<p><strong>Mrs. Koothrappali:</strong> She told us you're spending all our money on your new girlfriend.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I just got her a couple of things. She gives me things, too.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Yeah, yeah, I'm a gynecologist. I know exactly what she gives you.</p>", "8590": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I choose love.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Hah! You're an idiot. Love doesn't last.<br/>\nWell, he's going to find out eventually.<br/>\nThink about it.</p>", "8591": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> He likes your eyes.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You're making me sound like a caveman.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She says, \"thank you, and you have nice eyes, too.\"<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really? Ask her how many children she wants, and whatever number she says, say me too.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No.</p>", "8592": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, how go the wedding plans, Howard?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Great. We spent five hours last night at Macy's registering for gifts. Looks like I'm finally going to have that darling little earthenware asparagus dish I've always wanted.</p>", "8593": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> See, this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away. I can spend my nights doing whatever I want.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You mean like playing nerd games with us and then taking a suspiciously long shower?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe.</p>", "8594": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We enter the dungeon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You see a dragon.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really? So we're playing Dungeons and Dragons, and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon? Isn't that a little on the nose?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When you play Chutes and Ladders, do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders?</p>", "8595": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you gonna eat that whole pie?<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Maybe. Why not? Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, its just that everybody's got someone. Sheldon's with Amy, Howard's getting married, you're dating my sister.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Now that Howard's getting married, maybe he'll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you.</br></p>", "8596": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know who I blame for my loneliness? The United States of America. Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved with beautiful blond women with big bazongas.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Eat another pie, youll have your own bazongas.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips.</p>", "8597": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, Bernadette, how's the wedding planning going? And I'm not asking as a prospective bridesmaid. Pick me! Pick me!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We went cake-tasting yesterday. Raj came along. He cried and ate half the samples.</p>", "8598": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You know, I met a really cute girl at work. She's married to a guy in one of our drug trials.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, hello? She's married.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, but her husband is in serious congestive heart failure, and a little birdie told me he's in the placebo group.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, so future grief-stricken widow is the one to beat.</p>", "8599": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let's see what I'll be washing that succotash down with. A pitcher of margaritas.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you really want that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's the great thing. It doesn't matter. My mind is freed up to think about more important things.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What's it thinking about now?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hamburgers and lemonade.</p>", "8600": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> She says it's nice to meet you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Does she really mean that or was she signing it sarcastically?</p>", "8601": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And now for dessert, come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae. Bam! That's what I'm talking about!</p>", "8602": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, as soon as she gets here, so she knows I'm cool with it, I'm going to make a joke about her being deaf. I was thinking, hey, did you hear the one about..? Oh, no, I bet you didn't.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.</p>", "8603": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really? That's the first thing you want to say?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I worked on it all night. Use it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Look, I don't know the sign for opalescent.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Then spell it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know how to spell it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You're blowing this for me!</p>", "8604": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> He likes your eyes.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You're making me sound like a caveman.</p>", "8605": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Let's see, what else can I tell you about me that would make you like me? Ooh, I love music. Do you love music?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You really want to ask her that?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You're right. Everyone loves music.</p>", "8606": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> She says, do you play an instrument?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, but when I was six years old, I tried to start a boy band called Frankie Goes to Bollywood. But I couldn't get any other boys to join, so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers. Wait, when you sign servants, don't sign it like I'm bragging. Sign it in a way that I sound humble with just a hint of, that's right, I had servants.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Do you hear yourself?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes, but she doesn't. So get signing, hand monkey.</p>", "8607": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> This is her car. She hopes she can see you again sometime.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Good, good. Oh, boy, help me out here. Does she want me to kiss her or not?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I speak sign language, I don't read minds.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> If you were me, would you kiss her?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, but I'm a make out king.</p>", "8608": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Mustache is looking good there, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't thank me. Thank the dice. They told me what percentage of my face to shave.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why are you still doing this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because it's working. In the past few weeks, unburdened by trivial decisions, I've co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals, and I'm close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants.</p>", "8609": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Here's some other fun news on the Raj/Emily front. He gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're kidding.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You think she's taking advantage of him?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, of course not. She wouldn't do something like that. She's deaf.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Deaf women can't be gold diggers?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Handicapped people are nice, Leonard. Everyone knows that.</p>", "8610": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Could you tell us?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let's see. (Rolls dice) Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, hang on. Doubles. Roll again.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, get this. It doesn't matter if he's showering her with gifts, because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What do you mean, vastly wealthy?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, wealthy means a lot of money, and vastly means even more. I'm not sure what's tripping you up.</br></p>", "8611": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Listen, guys, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but I need to go call Raj's sister, who I love so much. So vastly much.</p>", "8612": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, so he's got money, and it's a few gifts and a car.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And she got him to pay off all her credit cards.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What? He paid off her credit cards? Damn it, I could've dated Raj for a couple months. But I, I wouldn't have, because I'm not that kind of girl.</p>", "8613": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> How dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We didn't mean for it to be an ambush. Just, it's kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people.</p>", "8614": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I'm so sorry. I wish I could make you feel better.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Seriously? I'm heartbroken and you\u2019re hitting on me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What? No!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Look, Penny, you're great, but I had a long talk with my parents, and they said if I date an Indian girl, I get a Maserati.</p>", "8615": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aren't you going with Sheldon?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele.</p>", "8616": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Should I go? I have been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What? Who told you that?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, most recently my gynaecologist.</p>", "8617": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother's house.</p>", "8618": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustafson this Friday. They're kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wouldn't you rather bring Sheldon?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not my fault. You said there'd be other scientists there my age.</p>", "8619": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You're a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Not without cutting his head open, no.</p>", "8620": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Who wants the last dumpling?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thank you all for this high honor.</p>", "8621": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, honey, if were gonna make the movie, we should go. (Raj stands up) This may be hard for you to hear, but when I say honey, I mean my fiance. (Raj whispers to Howard) Yeah, well, now it means her.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's okay if he wants to come.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine. But next time, we get a sitter.</p>", "8622": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theater or the Cheesecake Factory?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Neither of them are close.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, well, then I guess it doesn't matter which one of you drives me.</p>", "8623": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let's play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a printer's type size or a compulsion to eat dirt.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, Im not driving him.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, Penny, dont give up, you can get this.</p>", "8624": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I'm not buying anything. They're having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Which side do you come down on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people, I'm going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know it's O-gauge or no gauge.</p>", "8625": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> First of all, they're not tricks, they're illusions. And, secondly, when we get married, they're all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Why would I keep clothes at your mother's house?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, don't think of it that way. Once we move in, it'll be our house.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Is she moving out?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why would she move out? It's her house.</br></p>", "8626": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hang on. You seriously think I'm going to live with your mother?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that's exactly what he thinks.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why not? It's a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom's there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not ever.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues.</p>", "8627": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Raj, take me home.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't listen to her. Go to the movie theater.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Take me home now.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Movie theater.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Mmmmmm.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I don't care what you people do.</p>", "8628": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How was your shower?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, I'm up all night. I'm like a possum.</p>", "8629": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not really. Is that my yearbook?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, you're really good at science. Maybe one day you'll come up with a cure for being a dork.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, it wasn't spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that.</p>", "8630": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, you can add Jerry's Junction to the list of train stores Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in again.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Rough night, Casey Jones?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You don't know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's in the bag?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't want to talk about it. But it's not a spine,I'll tell you that.</p>", "8631": "<p>Mrs. <strong>Wolowitz:</strong> I don't know who you're talking to, but in or out! We don't need bugs!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The bugs only come here because you're their queen!</p>", "8632": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You're a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Not without cutting his head open, no.</p>", "8633": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? For a wedding?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Perhaps you're right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.</p>", "8634": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ready.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aww, so handsome. Like James Bond.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Better than James Bond, because he's tinier!</p>", "8635": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So, dinner went nice.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your meat for you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Only when it's fatty. Well, don't be jealous, babe. Someday you'll get to cut it for me.</p>", "8636": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Would you like to dance?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, thank you. I'm really not much of a dancer.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You're not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either.</p>", "8637": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why shouldn't they be? They have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. In some cultures, we'd stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so...</p>", "8638": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Ready for bed?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother's been in the bathroom for, like, an hour.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on. Ma, give up! Tonight's not your night!<br/>\nMrs. <strong>Wolowitz:</strong> You don't know that! I just sat down!</p>", "8639": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Come on, take a break! Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!<br/>\nMrs. <strong>Wolowitz:</strong> She can come in and brush her teeth! I'm not embarrassed!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Problem solved.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, it's not. I'm not going in there.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, come on, honey. She's just sitting in there reading a magazine. You can't see anything. I go in all the time.</p>", "8640": "<p>Mrs. <strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Ha! The eagle has landed!<br><strong>Howard:</strong> And we have splashdown. Wait here, I'm gonna go light a candle. And then we make passionate love.</br></p>", "8641": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it's okay to have fun once in a while.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You're welcome.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely.</p>", "8642": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, God, did he make a move on you?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, but it's only a matter of time. How could I have not seen this coming? Now I'm gonna have to break the little sad sack\u2019s heart.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I'm sure he'll be okay.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, Leonard just doesn't get my motor running.</p>", "8643": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No. I'll let him have tonight. Then in the morning, I'll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland. I mean, frankly, you've got a better shot than he does.</p>", "8644": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Hello, Leonard, if I may also say your name.</p>", "8645": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You need to remove that chair from the building. It\u2019s a health hazard.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. It's cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical smell. That's reassuring.</p>", "8646": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's like living with a Chihuahua.</p>", "8647": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centers for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned. (Penny tries to close the door) As a man with a keen sense of style, I must tell you, that chair does not work with the room.</p>", "8648": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You\u2019re good friends with Penny, right?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share traveling pants. Go on.</p>", "8649": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Cholera is water-borne. You're mocking me.</p>", "8650": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Will you listen to me play my harp now?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I'm going to experience an episode from my past.</p>", "8651": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'll try it. Like this?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Like this?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Close. Really French it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Better?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, you got it, you got it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm impressed. This is very lifelike.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Whoa! You just bit my tongue!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I, I nibbled. I was being playful.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why do you have to make everything weird?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sorry. Better?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, yeah.</p>", "8652": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Pretty cool, huh? Probably would cost, like, two hundred bucks in a store.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I do appreciate a bargain. This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're kidding.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Everything except bra and panties. And they're a leopard-spotted secret I share with Victoria.</p>", "8653": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, some people might say that it's great that we're trying to make things work long distance. They'd say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.</p>", "8654": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.</p>", "8655": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What are you doing?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, uh, Priya's calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It\u2019s eight o'clock in the morning in Mumbai. How can she have dinner?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, so technically it's not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you'd open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, \"Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That doesn't sound like mocking.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You didn't let me finish. Dinfast (rolls eyes).</br></p>", "8656": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are those soy-based candles?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. Why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast (rolls eyes).</p>", "8657": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Listen, I don't want to be rude, but Priya's gonna be calling any minute, so...<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, I've always admired that about you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As well you should. But I'm going to make an exception here.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, good.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> A hobby?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money.</p>", "8658": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't you like Amy?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Of course I like Amy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, there's the difference.</p>", "8659": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, it's no problem. It's actually kind of nice. You reading, me reading. We're like an old married couple.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't have iced tea and snickerdoodles.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A good wife would go to the store.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I want a divorce.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies.</p>", "8660": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I must say, I am enjoying your new chair.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's great, isn't it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What name?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Chair.</p>", "8661": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> This is fun. I've never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Pretty sweet, huh? This little baby set the university back 175 grand.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's three minutes. Should we see what we got?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hang on.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, yeah. This is one good-looking panini.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hand me the tuna melt.</p>", "8662": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now, knowing Penny, the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus. But, since that's what it looked like, we can rule that out. Let's put on our thinking cap, shall we? (Mimes doing so) Raj is from India, a tropical country. Third World hygiene. Parasitic infections are common, such as pinworms. he procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait until the subject is asleep, and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air. (Leonard spits out his food) Yes, just like that. Penny could have been inspecting Raj's anal region for parasites. Oh, boy. That's a true blue friend.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> They slept together, Sherlock.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, you weren't listening. She said, it's not what it looks like.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She lied.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Well don't I look silly sitting here wearing this?</p>", "8663": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That sounds like sarcasm, but I'm going to disregard it, because I have an agenda. Paintball. Specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. Now, in order to function better as a fighting unit, I thought we should establish a chain of command. Now, it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you, but the question remains, by how much? Now, I don't see me as some four-star general, back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defense. But I also can't be Sergeant Cooper, because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe. This might take some thought. As you were.</p>", "8664": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You're just jealous because it turns out I'm Penny's number two choice after Leonard.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, if I wasn't engaged to Bernadette, that totally could have been me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Please. Sheldon would have been before you, and he might not even have genitals.</p>", "8665": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You're not in love with Penny.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes, I am. The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Who?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> He's the Hindu version of Cupid, but way better, because he rides a giant parrot.</p>", "8666": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiancee.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm sorry. What?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Rubbish. He's talking rubbish.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That could have been about anyone. Besides, you have nothing to worry about, because now I'm the dusky half of Koothrapenny.</p>", "8667": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, my God, I screwed up everything. I hurt Leonard, I hurt Raj, I mean, what is wrong with me? I feel like two totally different people, Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore.</p>", "8668": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, I've done this before. In kindergarten, I was supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess, but by the time my class got out there, he was already engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb. So what did I do? Hung upside down from the monkey bars, let all the boys see my underpants.</p>", "8669": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know what? Let's get out of here.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Where are we going?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Somewhere where no one's seen me naked. We may have to drive awhile.</p>", "8670": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who said that? Leonard, I can hear your voice, but I can't see you.</br></p>", "8671": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> If you need any more help from me, my books are available on Amazon. Logging off.</p>", "8672": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, I don't even know what the point of me staying in L.A. is. I haven't gotten a single acting job since I moved out here. The closest I came was last month, I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, I could so see you being the face of hemorrhoids.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know, right?</p>", "8673": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, I can't let you do that.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> For the first time ever, I have a thriving social life. And no pressure, but it kind of lives and dies with you.</p>", "8674": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, uh, as your friend, you might like to know that, um, we didn't have sex in the conventional sense.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, God. Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?</p>", "8675": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> After we got undressed and jumped in bed, you, you asked if I had protection.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, you did, didn't you?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Of course. I'm always packing. Anyway, um, I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and, that was all she wrote.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So, we didn't actually<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I did. It was beautiful.</p>", "8676": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, here we go. This is us here. To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department. According to their Twitter feed, they're out of sunblock, which means they'll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma. That's our edge. All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge, the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won't know what hit them. All right, let's move out.</p>", "8677": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hang on, Sheldon. How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe he was too busy writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiancee.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Screw you. That was a beautifully written penis metaphor.</p>", "8678": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know what, guys, I'm not in the mood for paintball. What do you say we just bag it?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine with me.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sure, whatever.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You can't quit. That\u2019s a court-martial offense. That's punishable by \u2026 You can't quit.</p>", "8679": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'd like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory, Captain Sheldon Cooper.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Here, here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me. It's Major Sheldon Cooper. With my last breath, I awarded myself a battlefield promotion. It's kind of a big deal.</p>", "8680": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I already talked to Raj, but I wanted to apologize to the rest of you for, you know, everything.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Please, Penny, let me. We've decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you're feeling blue or you're in the shower. (places a hand on Penny's shoulder)<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, what you doing, Quick Draw?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sorry. Go on.</p>", "8681": "<p><strong>Mrs. Koothrappali:</strong> I'll sleep so much better when you move back here next month.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're moving back to India?<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Who's that?<br/><strong>Mrs. Koothrappali:</strong> Oh my God! There's someone in your apartment. Call the police in America!</p>", "8682": "<p><strong>Priya:</strong> Oh, hello, Leonard. What a pleasant surprise! Mummy, Daddy, you remember Rajesh's friend Leonard.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> I thought you said Rajesh was out with his friends.<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> He has many friends.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Rajesh has many friends?<br/><strong>Mrs. Koothrappali:</strong> Why are you lying to us?</p>", "8683": "<p><strong>Priya:</strong> Nice of you to come for Howard.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, he's my friend. It's what you do. (Laughs)<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> I'm sorry, did I miss something?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's just so weird. Howard Wolowitz is my friend. You know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and I broke his nose.<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> That's a little easier to believe than he's your friend.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, tell me about it.</p>", "8684": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's nice that they're getting along.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together? Oh, yeah, that can only be good for you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you talking about?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> One of them broke up with you. Do you really want her telling the other one why?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't care. I don't have anything to hide.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Good, good. Then you have nothing to worry about.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I do not. You are a mean little man.</p>", "8685": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You'd think it'd be because my parents didn't love me, but actually they loved me a great deal.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Bernie, it's not you. She's just set in her ways.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's the circle of life, sweetie. One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you.</br></p>", "8686": "<p><strong>Doctor:</strong> Mr. Wolowitz?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Is she okay?<br/><strong>Doctor:</strong> It wasn't a heart attack. She's awake, she's resting comfortably. We're still running a few tests.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Can I see her?<br/><strong>Doctor:</strong> Actually, she said, and I quote, she'd like to see the little Catholic girl first.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Me? Why me?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Jews have been asking that for centuries. There's no real good answer.</p>", "8687": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay, well, wish me luck.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Dont worry, you'll be fine. Let's just hide Mr. Cross. If it touches her, it burns.</p>", "8688": "<p><strong>Doctor:</strong> You brought a Catholic girl home to your mother?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Doctor:</strong> Why don't I write you a prescription for Xanax.</p>", "8689": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You want to talk about crazy mothers, Leonard's mom wouldn't give him any sort of approval growing up.<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> Oh, the poor thing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It makes him desperate to please women. That's why the foreplay goes on and on.<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> It does, doesn't it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's like he's trying to win a prize. A word of advice, don't doze off. You will never hear the end of it.</p>", "8690": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Every once in a while, before we'd go to bed, I'd put on a little show for her.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What do you mean, a show?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Like, to music?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'd look pretty stupid if there was no music.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> So you'd do a striptease?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I wasn't swinging around a pole.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Good, good.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> There was one time I put body glitter on.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I don't think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, she wouldn't.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Your big problem is me telling her.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You really are a mean little man.</p>", "8691": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> She thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure I was okay.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And are you?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, because I'm engaged to a putz! You let me believe I was the reason she had a heart attack.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, based on the available evid-<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Shut up! She said I'm a wonderful girl and that you're lucky to have me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Where are you going?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (sounding like Mrs. Wolowitz) To the toilet! Is that okay with you?</p>", "8692": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Is it just me, or does she sound sexy when she's angry?</p>", "8693": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Zandor, Wizard of the North. Ha! I win.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> If you skip the part about being under a two-week quarantine because you were exposed to a deadly disease, absolutely.</p>", "8694": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, do me a favor and take table seven.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You mean the one with my one hundred and eighteen-pound rock-hard stud of a fianc who's prone to canker sores and pinkeye?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Nah, I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend, who makes me feel like a toothless Okie.</p>", "8695": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Do you want me to spill hot soup on her?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, please, you're not that kind of person.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I know. But if she orders something low-fat I'll totally give her the full-fat version.</p>", "8696": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, that's my water.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> My water. You're drinking it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Dear Lord! Have you been drinking it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes. It's my water.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that's it then. I'm dead.</p>", "8697": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Here we go.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you? The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend.</p>", "8698": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey! That's my sister and my country you're talking about. Leonard may have defiled one, but I won't have you talking smack about the other.</p>", "8699": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You guys ready to order?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, Id like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting, and a mint.</p>", "8700": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's actually my napkin.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, this is a nightmare!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Where are you going?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> To the bar, to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. Gangway, dead man walking!</br></p>", "8701": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> All right. Here you go. Two lemonades, one iced tea and a root beer for Priya.<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> Is it diet?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's what you ordered.</p>", "8702": "<p><strong>Priya:</strong> Hey, have you and Howard started planning your wedding yet?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah. Were thinking of having it on a cliff overlooking the ocean.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters like the thought of falling and drowning.</p>", "8703": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> He hasn't told her yet. He's waiting for the right time.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.</p>", "8704": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fire demon.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ooh, fire demon. Sheldon's turning up the heat.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Troll master.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Check it! Howard pulls one out from under the bridge. Nice!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Water nymph.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, yeah, she's got puddles in all the right places.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Could you please play the game without commenting on every card?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sorry. Walking tree.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Last one.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm taking a stroll and I'm sporting wood.</p>", "8705": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, the Eagle has landed.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's going on?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Bernadette and my mother are having a get-to-know-you lunch at the Old Town Deli.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, that sounds lovely.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hope so. Of course, if history is any indication, my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl.</p>", "8706": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Have you met Bernadette's parents?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You mean Adolf and Eva? Not yet. One goose step at a time.</p>", "8707": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Ma, I'm home! Where are you?<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> I'm in the toilet.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So, how'd it go?<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> Too soon to say. I'm not done yet.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, I mean lunch, today, with Bernadette.<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> Oh! I had a pastrami sandwich. She had eggplant lasagna. Like that's what a person orders in a Jewish deli.</p>", "8708": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Besides food, did you get along? Did you talk?<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> Oh, sure. Did you know she's going to school to become a microbiologist?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, she never mentioned it.<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> I bet she did and you didn't listen.</p>", "8709": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So, what do you think? Do you like her? She's great, huh?<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> She's a lovely girl. Cute as a button.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's good to hear, 'cause I've got some news.<br/><strong>Mrs. Wolowitz:</strong> I hope it's good news, because I've got nothing but disappointment in here!</p>", "8710": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Haven't seen you in a while. How's it going?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my micro-villi into my circulatory system, hunky-dory. (Penny laughs) Did I say something amusing?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't know. Maybe, I have no idea what you said.</p>", "8711": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> My mirth. Classic.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's not a big deal, Sheldon. It's just, ever since Leonard's been dating Raj's sister, I've had to keep my distance. I don't get to hear all your jibber-jabber.</p>", "8712": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Howard and his mother are at the hospital. Come on, we gotta go.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, my God! What happened?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, let's go!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> To a hospital? Full of sick people? Oh, I don't think so.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there, we're going.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, don't tell me you're afraid of germs.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not all germs. Just the ones that will kill me. It's the same way I'm not afraid of all steak knives, just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Right, fine. I'll tell Howard you didn't come because you're more concerned about your own well-being than his.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I would think he would know that.</p>", "8713": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable. You buy all these superhero T-shirts, but when it's time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine, I'll go. Just for the record, my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital. She went in to visit my Uncle Roger, caught something and bit the dust a week later. The two of them now share a coffee can on my mother's mantel.</p>", "8714": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So I knocked down the bathroom door, picked up my poor unconscious mother, carried her to the car, and drove like a madman to the emergency room.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You're a real hero, Howard.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, I did what any son would do.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hang on a second, you picked up your mother? Her own legs are barely able to do that.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I was filled with adrenaline. It happens to be how women lift cars off babies.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I'm saying, it'd be easier to lift a car.</p>", "8715": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What can I tell you? After I found the courage to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable.</p>", "8716": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, how is she?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> They're running tests. I don't know. It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What's the difference?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A heart-attack-like event is an event that's like a heart attack.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thanks for clearing that up.</br></p>", "8717": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Regardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable. What's more likely going to kill Howard's mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, you're not helping.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Disagree.</p>", "8718": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So it's probably genetic.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, maybe. Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's not important.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Come on, Howard, I'm going to be your wife. You can share anything with me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You'd think that. But no.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You told her we were going to get married and she had a heart attack?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You can't take that personally.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> How else is she supposed to take it?</p>", "8719": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What you've got to keep in mind is that ever since my dad left, I've been the whole world to my mother. I mean, she'd be threatened by any woman who can give me what she can't.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You mean sexual intercourse?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy.</p>", "8720": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I must say, Penny, this is great fun.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Glad you're enjoying yourself.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination. Now they have a delightful social aspect.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Amy, you must've been in the bathroom with other women before.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Of course I have. But they were strangers and seemed off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit chat.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Some women don't like to get chummy when their panties are down.</p>", "8721": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You okay in there, bestie?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm fine.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I said I'm fine. Stop talking to me.</p>", "8722": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's nice.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, it's not. It's a strategic maneuver. Leonard's new girlfriend is testing Bernadette's loyalty to you and the group. That bitch is crafty.</p>", "8723": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It doesn't matter. I'm going to tell her we can't make it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, no. You have to go.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't understand. I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You are, with hair that smells like strawberries. And we're going to use that to our advantage.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait. What are you talking about?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp. She could ferret out Priya's tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as, Leonard's no stranger to back-alley cockfights.</p>", "8724": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't want anything in my ample bosom.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team.</p>", "8725": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced center combat-area problem? Five words, transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's brilliant.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's what I do. But wait, there's more. I also invented two new chess pieces. The serpent and the old woman.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When the serpent slithers to an opposing player's piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. Ugh.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Elegant.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's because it's simple.</p>", "8726": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And...<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And what?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And a third person. It's three-person chess. I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge. You should reflect on that.</p>", "8727": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> The lonely guy and the two happy couples? I'd rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.</p>", "8728": "<p>Priya: Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I have to feel sorry for myself. I'm the only one who cares. Just like I'm the only one who'll have sex with me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? In front of your sister?<br/>\nPriya: We shared a room growing up. This is not news to me.</p>", "8729": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No. Once these puppies touch the ground they're mine, and I'll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off. Pretty, pretty, pretty.</p>", "8730": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Good news, the wildebeest is in the curry.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> The what?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard. Message received. Commence Operation \"Priya Wouldn't Wanna Be-ya.\"</br></p>", "8731": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey. Seriously? Didn't you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I wish. A clique requires friends. I didn't have any.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> None?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop.</p>", "8732": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hang on. It's the wildebeest. Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What the hell did she say?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> She thinks it's cool you're following your dream, no matter what.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That bitch!</p>", "8733": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How do you want to handle it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I'm on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Got it. Is it going to be in 3-D?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What? I don't know. It doesn't matter.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm gonna say 3-D. That'll let her know the studio has faith in it.</p>", "8734": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're kidding. 3-D?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's what I hear.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Then the studio must have real faith in it.</p>", "8735": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I need a hug.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sorry, I have company.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Come on, Sheldon, open the door.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't want to hug you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't want to hug you, either. I was just feeling blue.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Blue, as in depressed?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, not so much depressed as lonely.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know what color lonely is.</p>", "8736": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, thank you. I'm fine.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not optional. We're out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.</p>", "8737": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon, listen to me. I have a big decision to make, and I'm scared.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yellow. Go ahead.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they're testing. He says it's the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fascinating. What's in it?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I like cows.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's not the point.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It was its own point. Go on.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm a scientist. My ability to think is my bread and butter. I'm afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Rajesh, I've had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.</p>", "8738": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, I'm still trying to work this out. How did Penny meet an astronaut?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't know. The regular way people meet astronauts.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Most of those guys live in Texas.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Obviously, this one doesn't.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Leonard lives here. Priya's from India. People meet, Howard. God!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You've met lots of astronauts, and I've never grilled you about that. I'd thank you to extend me the same courtesy.</p>", "8739": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I still can't get over the fact that she got a big movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend's up to, 'cause I don't.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Maybe that's where she met the astronaut, all right?<br/>\nPriya: I'm sorry. What would an astronaut be doing working on a movie?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> He's a consultant.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> He can't have a hobby? Excuse me, I have to pee. Or is that implausible, as well?</p>", "8740": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> (on the phone) I think they're on to me. The story's starting to fall apart.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> (on the phone) Calm down. Everything's going to be okay. (To Penny) We may have to kill her.</p>", "8741": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy's stupid astronaut story!<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What astronaut story?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You texted me \"Penny's dating an astronaut.\"<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I texted architect. That's amusing. Auto-correct must've changed it.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, it's hysterical.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?</p>", "8742": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'd like to buy a scone.<br/><strong>Waitress:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry, we're out. We have muffins.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones.</p>", "8743": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Nice to see that the gals are getting along.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Gals? Who are you, Fred Flintstone?</p>", "8744": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My catapult flings my bishop to Howard's Queen's Gorilla two.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Nice. Okay, rook to transporter pad. And he comes out at Leonard's Queen's Bishop five-and-a-third. Check on Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When it's done charging. Or you land on the time machine. Obviously.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I knew I should have given my Pope the jet pack.</p>", "8745": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> She always this crabby when she urinates?<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We're really not that close.</br></p>", "8746": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? By going after its weakest member.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well what makes me the weakest member?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn't last a minute on the Serengeti.</p>", "8747": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm not a very good liar. They kind of whip that out of  you in Catholic school.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Don't worry. I'll teach you. I did two years of Cub Scouts before they found out I was a girl.</p>", "8748": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Didn't you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I wish. A clique requires friends. I didn't have any.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> None?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop.</p>", "8749": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, cool. I've got a lawyer. And I've seen her naked.</p>", "8750": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> No offense, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that's happened today.</p>", "8751": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Mmm, Greek food on pizza night? This is the most delightfully cruel thing we've done to Sheldon since we left that fake message from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail.</p>", "8752": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> How come if we're the smart people, we don't do this every night?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's sixteen times 14?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> My burps taste like cranberry juice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And there's your answer.</p>", "8753": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a poison dart. No jury would convict us 'cause people love monkeys.</p>", "8754": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Now, hold on. If she is dating an American, that's not a bad way to go. He's Jewish. Those chaps are very successful, and they don't drink a lot.</p>", "8755": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Ah, here's the alcohol and drug peer pressure Mother warned me about. I was starting to think it was never going to happen. Yes, please.</p>", "8756": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You guys should've seen Leonard when I first met him. There was no eye contact. He was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm drunk.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, for the first couple of months, whenever I would take off my bra, he would giggle and say, oh boy, my breast friends.</p>", "8757": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'm never speaking to Priya again.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, don't do that. No reason to be mean to her.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> This may be the alcohol talking, but I believe there is. Are you familiar with the recent study of Tanzanian chimpanzees by Nishida and Hosaka out of Kyoto University?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, but I can name all the Kardashians.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop. Bernadette's urge to shun, scowl or fling her waste at Priya is hard-wired into her DNA.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I don't have an urge to fling my waste.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Believe me, it's there, we all have it. Hit me with some more booze, and I'll show you.</p>", "8758": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, here we are, this is the tavern where all the black-market weapon trades go down.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't think my character should be in a place like this. Everyone's undressing her with their eyes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up.</p>", "8759": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So, how do you guys want to play this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Be ruthless. You tell him if he doesn't start talking, we'll register a complaint with his Internet service provider.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet from his cable company? He could lose his HBO and all their delightful original programming.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't care! I'm losin' it, man!</p>", "8760": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why don't we play this smart? Try a little good goblin, bad goblin.<br><strong>Priya:</strong> Oh, dear Lord.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Nah, I think we have to be more subtle.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, I see where this is going. Fine, I'll have sex with him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's not where it was going.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Good, because I would hate that.</br></p>", "8761": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hi. We're just heading out for a drink.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Because I do that now.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Count your blessings you're not a Tanzanian chimp.<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Don't listen to her, she's had a lot of ice cream.</p>", "8762": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Do you want to join us?<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> Oh, thank you, but I have work to do.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Four women walk down the stairs, how many reach the lobby?</p>", "8763": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, no, don't put me in the middle of this. I'm not going to be your go-between.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, help me out. Am I in trouble?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> There's no reason to worry.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's a relief.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights Skyping with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.</p>", "8764": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Our culprit is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711 Ocean View Road, Carlsbad, California.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The name and the address drip with evil.</p>", "8765": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know if you've been following the news, Leonard, but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No one's getting tortured.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine, we'll abide by the Geneva Convention.</p>", "8766": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But ask yourself this, in the course of our lives, how much lunch money has been taken from us? How many kites? How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I totally had one of those.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course you did. It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. But the bullies took it from us. Well, no more. Tonight, we take back our dignity, our birthright and our pride.</p>", "8767": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I have a hip-hop aerobics class at five, could we go after?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Also, tonight's the Sabbath and my mother and I have a tradition of lighting the candles and watching Wheel of Fortune, so If we could leave at eight, we'd still be able to regain our birthright at ten, ten thirty latest.</p>", "8768": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, I thought this delay was so you could watch Wheel of Fortune with your mother.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I am. She's just bleaching her mustache. Check it out. Hey, Ma! Before and After! Four words, 17 letters, two N's, one V.<br/>\nMrs. <strong>Wolowitz:</strong> (offscreen) Fanny pack of wolves.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's incredible.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, she's kind of a Wheel savant.</p>", "8769": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> New puzzle, Ma. Same name. One N, two D's, three O's.<br/>\nMrs. <strong>Wolowitz:</strong> (offscreen) Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's uncanny.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I know. It's her superpower. Well, that and jiggling her arm fat.</p>", "8770": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I almost feel sorry for the poor fool, sitting in his split-level suburban ranch, unaware that a vengeful horde is barreling down the San Diego Freeway at 71 miles an hour. Ease up there, lead foot. You trying to get us killed?</p>", "8771": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's a re-writable CD. Just put it in.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Beyonce? Really?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> She's curvy and she owns it. I like that.</p>", "8772": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Next time we go to kick someone's ass, we take the train.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I always prefer the train.</p>", "8773": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, let's get clear on something. We're just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one's batlething anybody.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So my blade shall not taste blood tonight?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, now I just feel silly holding it.</p>", "8774": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can I at least kick down the door?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're welcome to try, but the other day, it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box.</p>", "8775": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you Todd Zarnecki?<br><strong>Todd Zarnecki:</strong> Yeah. Who are you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am Sheldor of Azeroth. I want my things back.<br/><strong>Todd Zarnecki:</strong> I don't think so. Let me see that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Careful. That's a collectible.<br/><strong>Todd Zarnecki:</strong> I know. I've always wanted one. (Closes door, taking Sheldon's bat'leth)<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, he's even more cunning than we thought.</br></p>", "8776": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, the joke's on him. Without the certificate of authenticity, that bat'leth is worthless.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, he walked right into our trap.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Legoland seems like a hollow dream now.</p>", "8777": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh-oh.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What's the matter?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Something's wrong, I'm not getting any gas. Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Very basic.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> 19th-century technology.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, not a clue.</p>", "8778": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, we'd better call somebody to come pick us up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It'd be swell if they had a train.</p>", "8779": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you, Penny.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No problem. So, Leonard, I think it's interesting you didn't call your girlfriend to come get you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, I kind of told her I was working.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So you lied to her. Also interesting.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, she doesn't really understand the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, doesn't matter if she gets it, as long as she's pretty.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> This one's funny, Leonard. How come you couldn't make it work with her?</p>", "8780": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait a minute! You're not going to do anything?<br/><strong>Police Officer:</strong> Mr. Cooper, theres nothing-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Doctor Cooper.<br/><strong>Police Officer:</strong> Seriously?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not the kind with access to drugs.<br/><strong>Police Officer:</strong> Fine. Dr. Cooper. I'm sorry for your loss, but the Pasadena Police Department doesn't have jurisdiction in Pandora.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's from Avatar. World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth. Goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun?</p>", "8781": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?<br/><strong>Police Officer:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules, and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?<br/><strong>Police Officer:</strong> No.</p>", "8782": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's all gone. All gone.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm really sorry, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What kind of world do we live in, where a man would take another man's battle ostrich?</p>", "8783": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm on it. (On phone) Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there? Okay, thanks. (To Sheldon) That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> See if Raj is done with Pilates.</p>", "8784": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Three thousand hours. Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse, collecting weapons and gold. It's almost as if it was a huge waste of time.</p>", "8785": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh! There isn't enough chamomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart.</p>", "8786": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hold on. I'm talking to an orc under the bridge in Thunder Bluff who says if we pay him, he'll help us track down your things.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can we trust him?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I should say so, he appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family.</p>", "8787": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Whoa! Somebody's auctioning off a jewelled ostrich bridle!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. Glenn's was leather. He was a simple ostrich. Is! Is, I haven't given up hope.</p>", "8788": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, well, anyways, I brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Stale pastry is hollow succor to a man who is bereft of ostrich.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Just say thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I thought I just did.</p>", "8789": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, hi! I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon. He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that's useful in a make-believe place.<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> I don't know what that means.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, well, sadly, I do.</p>", "8790": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Did you know last weekend Priya took Leonard rollerblading at the beach? Can you believe that?<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I feel like I'm supposed to say that bitch, but I don't have enough information.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste, I had to carry him to the water.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I took Howard to the beach once. He almost burst into flames like a vampire.</br></p>", "8791": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So what's the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material? I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I think you're on.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh. That bitch!</p>", "8792": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not cool. It's a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. How'd you do it?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> A magician never reveals his secrets. But surely a future Nobel prize winner can figure it out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine. Give me a second.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You ever notice when he thinks real hard, it smells like bacon?</p>", "8793": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> That's your card, right?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Seven of clubs! That is amazing!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not amazing. All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, really? So how did I do it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I don't care how you did it. I have more important things to think about. Clearly, the cards are marked.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I thought you had more important things to think about.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I do. You just happen to have caught me on a break.</p>", "8794": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm not going out with him. He can sleep with whoever he wants.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, I was talking to Raj.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oopsy.</p>", "8795": "<p>Priya: How many Star Trek uniforms do you have?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just two. Everyday and dress.</p>", "8796": "<p>Priya: You need to cut the cord with Penny.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh. Okay.<br/>\nPriya: You don't sound very confident.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, no, I'm confident. It's not like I'm unfamiliar with the get lost conversation. Although, this will be the first time Illl be the one saying it.</p>", "8797": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> And was your card the jack of diamonds?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, unbelievable! Know how he did it yet?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Umm...<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Aww, he has the same look my little nephew gets when he can't figure out how I got his nose.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, I have some remedial magic tricks that might be more your speed. Like, ooh, look! The pencil's rubber!</p>", "8798": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, I think I know how you did the card trick.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Oh, please. If I don't know, you don't know. That's axiomatic.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Come here. (Whispers theory to Howard)<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're right.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Not too bad for someone who doesn't know what axiomatic means.</p>", "8799": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, hi.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, you. What happened with the contacts?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> One of them's upstairs. The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.</p>", "8800": "<p>Priya: So did you get to talk to Penny?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, yes. Indeed, I did.<br/>\nPriya: And?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She completely understood everything I said. Case closed.<br/>\nPriya: Was she upset?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe, but that's not my problem. She's not my girlfriend, you are.<br/>\nPriya: I hope you weren't cruel to her.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is that just nature's way?</p>", "8801": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Holy crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. I'm using their Cray Supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, that computer is used for national defense. Hacking into it is a federal crime.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Relax, we're not under attack right now.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, I'm leaving before the black helicopters get here.</p>", "8802": "<p>Priya: Why didn't you wear your contacts? Don't you like them?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, no, I do. Its just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time.</p>", "8803": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> It's okay, I like Indian food.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Or as you probably call it back home, food.</p>", "8804": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> I'm Zack and I'm, uh ... could you come back to me?</p>", "8805": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Big fight with my mother.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Still arguing over which CSI is the best?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, we agreed they all have their merits. This was about Bernadette.</br></p>", "8806": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Penny, you became disenchanted with Leonard as a lover. Would you please tell my sister why?</p>", "8807": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Leonard, I swear to God, if you sister ever comes to town, I shall have my way with her.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> my sister's thirty-eight and married.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.</p>", "8808": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's remarkable. If pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace German shepherds at our nation's airports.</p>", "8809": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm sorry. I didn't know you had company. I don't want to impose.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, no. It's not an imposition. At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please, fly into our open maw and have at it.</p>", "8810": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be for porn.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did you get the part?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I didn't do the audition.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?</p>", "8811": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What's so funny?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Nothing. Just thinking about the noises people make during sex.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I do sometimes get a bit carried away, don't I?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It's cute. You sound a little like a drunken monkey. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know it's meant as a compliment.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's how I take it.</p>", "8812": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, gotta go.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh! Already? Why don't you stay over?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, I'd love to, but you know my mother needs me in the morning.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Please, I think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's not just the wig. It's pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows. It's a two-person job.</p>", "8813": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howard, have you ever considered us living together?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Boy, I don't know. You, me, Ma living under the same roof?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, I mean just you and me. You can move in here, or we can find a place.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I've got a better solution.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We wait for my mom's heart to explode from all the salt she eats. Then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom.</p>", "8814": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Point of inquiry. Given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend, why didn't you seek refuge under his roof?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> There's no room. His sister is staying with him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait, wait. What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Cocoa, Leonard. Focus. I'm down in the dumps here.</p>", "8815": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It's completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch! All right, you may talk in the bedroom, but I want this door to remain open! All right, just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind I'll be right out here monitoring the situation! (Makes a phone call) Oh, damn it. Leonard, when you get this message, call me. (Makes another call) Priya, this is your brother. When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail.</p>", "8816": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.<br/>\nPriya: Rajesh, you know Leonard and I spent the night together.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, but you were just sleeping, because I forboded you to have sex.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The word is forbade.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.</p>", "8817": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Listen, my mom's going to Palm Springs to visit her sister. That's two whole nights in a row I can sleep over with you all the way to morning. Unless the desert air dries out her sinuses, in which case I'll have to schlep out there with the big humidifier.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> That's it? That's your big solution to all of our problems? If your mom's nose holds up, we get two nights together?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Isn't that great?</p>", "8818": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, what is all that stuff?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> This is a portable electroencephalogram. I'm doing research on emotions and brain activity. So when you start crying, I can see which region of the brain is activated. Then I'm going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries. Cool, huh?</p>", "8819": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I choose you.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yep. I moved out of my mother's house. Cord is cut. I'm all yours.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What did she say when you told her?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. She hasn't responded to my email yet.</p>", "8820": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I can't believe we're finally living together.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah. You know what would make this moment perfect?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> A little snack. You got any string cheese?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No. I, I might have some cheddar.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Not as good. You can't make strings with it. Remind me to put it on your shopping list.</br></p>", "8821": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You have hypo-allergenic detergent?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Better put it on the list. If you wash my underwear with regular soap, I get little red bumps on my tuchus.</p>", "8822": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Wait a second. I'm doing your laundry?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, honey, it's not gonna do itself. Oh, before I forget. Tomorrow morning, you're driving me to the dentist.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I have to take you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You don't have to take me. You get to take me.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Wait a minute. Are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's not weird. There's lots of kids there with their moms.</p>", "8823": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I can't believe this.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What? It's fun. If I have no cavities, afterwards, we go out for a treat.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> All right, Howard, let's get something straight right now. I'm not going to be your mother.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where did that come from?</p>", "8824": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I smell Chinese food.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's actually Thai. You're slipping.</p>", "8825": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Are Leonard and Priya here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They went to Catalina for the weekend.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. Where's Raj?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> At home, forbidding it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> How about Howard?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.</p>", "8826": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Here's what I wonder about zombies. What happens if they can't get any human flesh to eat? They can't starve to death, they're already dead.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You take this one. I spent an hour last night on how do vampires shave when they can't see themselves in the mirror?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other. Case closed.</p>", "8827": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, okay, so, zombies.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj. Are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies? Like, in 28 Days, if those zombies didn't eat, they starved.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're thinking of 28 Days Later. 28 Days is where Sandra Bullock goes to rehab and puts the audience into an un-dead state<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, don't bag on Sandra Bullock! You think it makes you look cultured, but you just come off as bitter.</p>", "8828": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, Dr. Siebert, twelve o'clock.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why's the president of the university slumming in the cafeteria?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perhaps he's emulating Shakespeare's Henry V, who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them, to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects. Course, if he'd have read any of the thirteen hundred e-mails I've sent him on the subject of his administration, he could have saved himself the trouble.</p>", "8829": "<p><strong>President Siebert:</strong> So, listen, fellas, who's up for a little party this Saturday night? Open bar, good eats, might even be a few pretty girls.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sounds great!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm in!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hold on. Just because the nice man is offering you candy, doesn't mean you should jump into his windowless van. What's the occasion?<br/><strong>President Siebert:</strong> Just a little fund-raiser for the university.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aha! The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van.</p>", "8830": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, Howard, I can't believe Bernadette let you go to a fancy party wearing a dickey.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Excuse me, my girlfriend doesn't pick out my clothes. My mother does.</p>", "8831": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you sure this is right?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, just tuck that part in your pants;  you'll be fine.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, let's go smooch some rich, wrinkled tuckus.</p>", "8832": "<p><strong>President Siebert:</strong> Ah. There's my band of brainiacs. Where's Dr. Cooper?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He's tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of God.</p>", "8833": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Nice place. Reminds me of my parents' house back in New Delhi.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're kidding.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No. We are very wealthy. But the only difference is, we have more servants.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> More than this?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> More than we can use. You see, in India, we don't make the mistake of letting our poor people have dreams.</p>", "8834": "<p><strong>President Siebert:</strong> Mrs. Latham, I'd like you to meet three of our outstanding young researchers. This is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali and Howard Wolowitz.<br/><strong>Mrs. Latham:</strong> Well, what happened to you, Wolowitz, couldn't stick with it long enough to get your PhD?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm an engineer. Most engineers don't bother with a PhD. But you may be interested to know I designed the zero-gravity waste-disposal system for NASA.<br/><strong>Mrs. Latham:</strong> Got it. You're a space plumber.</p>", "8835": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, you're an expert on trading sexual favors for material gain, walk him through this.</p>", "8836": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And so, instead of bowing to pressure, and going to that pointless soire, I stayed right here and did a load of whites.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> (On webcam) Well, normally I respect your macho rebellious attitude toward The Man, but, in this case, I think you'vee made a foolish mistake.</br></p>", "8837": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just a few things you may need tonight. There's baby oil, condoms, and a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology. They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green M&amp;M.</p>", "8838": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> On the bright side, I don't think President Siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It was so much easier at my bar mitzvah. The old people just came up to you, pinched your cheek and handed you a savings bond.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, don't be such gloomy gusses. Look at the size of these shrimp! At what point do we start calling them lobsters?</p>", "8839": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Face it, Raj, we crashed and burned tonight.<br/><strong>Mrs. Latham:</strong> Oh, you didn't do that badly.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mrs. Latham, the first machine I turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser, 'cause it needs to warm up.<br/><strong>Mrs. Latham:</strong>: I no longer care, dear.</p>", "8840": "<p><strong>Mrs. Latham:</strong> I no longer care, dear. But don't worry, I really enjoyed meeting you this evening.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're kidding. That was good for you? 'cause I was sweating through my T-shirt.<br/><strong>Mrs. Latham:</strong> Excellent! There's nothing I like better than making smart people feel ill at ease.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Mrs. Latham:</strong> Oh, I don't know, it's one of the fun things you get to do when you have lots of money. Watch. (To Raj) Hey! Who said you could eat that shrimp? See? Fun.</p>", "8841": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, no, no, I'm just here for your money. I don't want to shake anyone's germy hands. Explain it to them, Siebert.</p>", "8842": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I must confess I don't understand you, President Siebert. First you say you want me to appear at your fund-raisers, but now you say you never want me to go anywhere near your fund-raisers. Forgive me, but that sounds like a mixed message. Here we go again. If there's simply no talking to me, why did you call? I'm sorry, someone's on the other line. Why don't you see if you can organize your thoughts, and we'll try again later.</p>", "8843": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong>  Cooper-Hofstadter residence. Go for Cooper. Good morning, Mrs. Latham. Well, yes, of course I remember you. A woman well past her prime seeking to augment her social status by doling out her late husband's ill-gotten gains.<br/>\nSo, how much money are you going to give me? I'm not crazy, my mother had me tested. Well, if you're not going to give me money, then why are you calling? She wants to talk to you. Who's crazy now?</p>", "8844": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, I see what's happening.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My stature intimidates her, so she's using you to get to me. Crafty old gal.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment. I've been published in peer-reviewed journals, I received a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, that can't be it.</p>", "8845": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, so, eventually, zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, it's a shame, all that work she's doing to get sober, only to be torn apart and eaten alive.</p>", "8846": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey. How was dinner?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Swell. I need a drink. Do we have any alcohol?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. But we have potatoes, I could make you vodka. It'll take two weeks.</p>", "8847": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, wow!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, we can't keep explaining everything. Read that book we got you.</p>", "8848": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Are you telling us that old lady wanted to have sex with you in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I think so.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You lucky duck.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're really a broken toy, aren't you?</p>", "8849": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What was all that about me trading sexual favors for material gain?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It was a compliment. I believe in giving credit where credit is due.</p>", "8850": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I am not going to have sex with her.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Maybe this will overcome your reluctance. I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming. Check out those saddle shoes. Rar!</br></p>", "8851": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm so proud of you! You sold yourself out like a common streetwalker!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I didn't do it for the money.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She stiffed you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I believe that's what your roommate did to her.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Again, read the book we gave you.</p>", "8852": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Apparently, if you're Sheldon, all you need to do is turn your back.</p>", "8853": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you realize that teaching is the first thing I've failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?</p>", "8854": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, just to be clear. You are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn't.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I suppose that's one way to look at it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I think it's the only way to look at it.</p>", "8855": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon's lecture. Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. Plus, he looks like a giant insect.</p>", "8856": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Look. Listen to this one. Does Einstein's theory explain why time flies when you're having fun, but when you're listening to Dr. Cooper, it falls out of the sky, dead?</p>", "8857": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, Leonard, is your wi-fi down? I can't get on.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, Sheldon changed the password. It's now Penny is a freeloader. No spaces.</p>", "8858": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What are you guys doing?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. We're reading the reviews.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. How'd he do?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl meets Three Mile Island meets Tron 2.</p>", "8859": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good evening, Leonard, Howard, Raj, freeloader.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So, how'd the lecture go?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In a word, triumphant.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? Triumphant?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, yes, you should have seen those young people. Thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom. I may have changed a few lives today.</p>", "8860": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, tweets about my lecture. Hmm. That's rather unfair. That's downright cruel. Plus, insects have six legs. Yeah, I'm not familiar with the acronym KMN.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now.</p>", "8861": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> And just for the record, labradoodles are hypo-allergenic, which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander.</p>", "8862": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Have you considered improving your socialization skills, thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Isn't that their burden? I'm the one with something interesting to say.</p>", "8863": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Acting lessons. Interesting. It might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn.</p>", "8864": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're an (air quotes) actress, correct?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm not an (air quotes)actress. I'm an actress.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right. You're an actress. I need you to teach me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You want an acting lesson?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perhaps two. I'd like to master the craft.</p>", "8865": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, where is this coming from?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed, I suck the big one.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put 'em on my fridge.</br></p>", "8866": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, when could we start?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, just to be clear. You are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn't.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I suppose that's one way to look at it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I think it's the only way to look at it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you going to help me or not?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Probably. I'm just enjoying the foreplay. Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry, I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one's career had reached the end of the road.</p>", "8867": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You were acting?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. In preparation for today's studies, I read Stanislavski's An Actor Prepares, Stella Adler's The Technique of Acting, Uta Hagen's Respect for Acting, and Henry Winkler's Ey!, I'm an Actor.</p>", "8868": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How shall we begin?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I thought we'd start with some basic movement exercises. You know, get our bodies warmed up a little.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. You know, just do whatever feels natural. Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (standing still) You said to do whatever feels natural. This feels natural. Certainly more natural than what you're doing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on, you got to work with me. We need to get connected with our bodies.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, my body and I have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other.</p>", "8869": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay. Uh, no, the shipment has not arrived, and I really need those shoes. They are my biggest seller. Yes, ladies sizes six through ten. Thank you. Oh, sorry, I have to go, I have a customer. Bye-bye. Hi. Can I help you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'd like a frozen yogurt, please.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yogurt?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Um, okay, sure. Luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You do?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes. Look up at the sign. And remember, improv is always about saying yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right. Yes. I see a sign. It says Camarillo State Mental Hospital.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.</p>", "8870": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What would you rather do as a scene study?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm glad you asked. I took the liberty of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And you think it's better than Tennessee Williams?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why don't we leave that for future generations to decide?</p>", "8871": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> \"Where No Sheldon Has Gone Before.\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas to the 23rd Century, where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> KMN.</p>", "8872": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so I'm thinking you'll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry. You'll be Spock?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's only logical.</p>", "8873": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Very well. I'll set the scene.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All right.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> East Texas. A warm summer night. A woman, Mary, stands on a porch. In the distance, we hear a lonesome train whistle. Woo-woo. The droning buzz of cicadas. Zzzzzzzzz. A coyote howls at the moon, frightening sensitive young boys everywhere. Ow-ow-ow! Out in the woods, an owl screeches.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, okay. We get it. You set the scene.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hoot!</p>", "8874": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Now just read your mother's line.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Shelly! Shelly, how many times have I told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? Goodness, I'll never understand that boy. But then again, I'm a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. Spock to Enterprise. Transport successful.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Glory be to Heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. George, put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ain't foolin' no one, and get your shotgun!</p>", "8875": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Shelly? A man's here to take you away to the future. Be sure to pack clean underwear.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's good. That's good. That's good.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mommy, why are you crying? 'cause I'm gonna miss you, Shelly-bean, even though you creep the bejeezus out of me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, I guess we're improvising now.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well I'm sorry. It's not my fault. I'm just incredibly smart, and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks. Oh, now, don\u2019t you start crying. You get in that spaceship. Mommy's late for Indian bingo.</p>", "8876": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey. So you guys ready to order?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o'clock and order the same exact thing, and it's now 6:08, I believe your question not only answers itself, but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as \"Who let the dogs out?\" and, uh, \"How are they hanging?\"</p>", "8877": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay. So, the usual, with extra spit on Sheldon's hamburger.</p>", "8878": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Penny, a moment? Do you have plans this weekend?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, gee, Amy, I'm sorry. I'm actually pretty busy this weekend.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Probably serving food that was ordered today.</p>", "8879": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Shame. Since you're my best friend, I thought it would be a good bonding opportunity.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm your best friend?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Don't you read my blog?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, don't feel bad. I never read Leonard's, and I used to sleep with him.</p>", "8880": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you know anybody else who would appreciate an all-expense-paid spa weekend at a four-star resort in Big Sur?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> No, I really - Im sorry, free what? Sorry, what, what?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I think her weekend just opened up.</br></p>", "8881": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, it is going to be difficult, but I'm going to cancel my plans so I can do this for my bestie.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Please don't touch my breasts.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I- I wasn't going to.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> All right. I just want to establish boundaries.</p>", "8882": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Boy, this is great. I haven't had a vacation in ages.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In order to take a vacation, one first has to work.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, for a smart guy, you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept, don't piss off the people who handle the things you eat.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That does seem to be a valid principle.</p>", "8883": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good morning. If I could have everyone's attention, please? I know we're all eager to get on the road to Big Sur, so if we focus, I'm sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour. Then it's just Q&amp;A, quiz, safety drills, pose for commemorative group photo, and we're off.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (To Penny) Don't worry. Just sit next to me during the quiz, and you can copy my answers.</p>", "8884": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We have seven people and two cars. In the lead car, driven by Leonard, will be myself, Amy Farrah Fowler and Penny.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes! He had you in the other car, but I got you upgraded.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yay.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere, your Nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Brawny?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> They're bigger than mine.</p>", "8885": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Who elected you Road Trip God?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard...<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It was a late-night vote. We were all exhausted and he was threatening to filibuster. It's not technically Road Trip God, it's Travel Supervisor.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Although Road Trip God does have a certain ring to it.</p>", "8886": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I can't believe you let him kick me out of the car.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What could we do? He's the Travel Supervisor.</p>", "8887": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, Bernie?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Please tell me he's your gay cousin.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No. He was one of my professors in college.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh! That's a relief.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Then we went out for a year.</p>", "8888": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> That green bag is Dr. Cooper's. Here's an extra five. Make him wait.</p>", "8889": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm just thinking. If you had sex with that guy, I mean, there's nothing I can do here that will make any kind of ... impact.</p>", "8890": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Wait a minute, \"a girl like me\"? What's that mean?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm-I'm--<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Are you saying you don't think I'm hot enough to go out with a guy like Glenn?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No! No, I'm saying exactly the opposite.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm too hot to go out with a guy like Glenn?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, let's go with that.</p>", "8891": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, girl talk?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Um, sure. What do you- what do you got in mind?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you subscribe to the Freudian theory of penis envy?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Um, I never really thought about it. Why?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sometimes I think it might be nice to have one.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Not for sex, for convenience. You can't deny that, by comparison, our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Again, I've never given it much thought.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> We have time now. Think about it.</p>", "8892": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Can I stay here tonight?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. Why, what happened?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howard's a complete and total ass.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, yeah, that. Come on in.</p>", "8893": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Thanks. I'll sleep on the floor.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Not necessary. Penny and I are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We are?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Of course, we're best friends.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, right, right, the blog.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Word of warning, though. I'm prone to night terrors, so if I wake up kicking and screaming, don't panic. Just pin me down and stroke my hair, and I'll be fine.</p>", "8894": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Please tell me you're not having coitus.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We are not having coitus.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can you guarantee that it won't happen at any time during the night?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.</p>", "8895": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure, no problem.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know it's kinda weird.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> True dat.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> True dat?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I've gotten a lot more street since we broke up.</br></p>", "8896": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Still mad at me about that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. No, I understand. I got too intense, you had to back off.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I've gotten a lot better at that, you know. I've dated four different women since we broke up and I didn't tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Good for you.</p>", "8897": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sure. I think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days. It's not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. As a microbiologist, I can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Interesting. I think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of interest  is tiny organisms, she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I think Mr. Wolowitz needs to keep in mind that the past is the past. But he should know that I am the kind of girl who could get all the giant missiles she wants.</p>", "8898": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Are we talking about women wanting penises? Because I'd like to weigh in.</p>", "8899": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I did. You said no Bridget Jones.</p>", "8900": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, wait, just to be clear, when you guys say spa, does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Pretty much. Except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.</p>", "8901": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, Amy, I've been wondering, are you and Sheldon going to be sharing a room?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, we discussed it. We decided we didn't want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone's toilet routine.</p>", "8902": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, can I stay here tonight?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Shh, Sheldon's asleep. What's going on?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, Howard's a complete and total ass, Bernadette's in my bed, and no matter how much you stroke Amy's hair, she bites.</p>", "8903": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sweetie, let me put this in a way you'll understand. From the waist down, my shields are up.</p>", "8904": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I think we should take a picture to capture this moment.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah! (Fart noise)<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Was that the best 99 cents I ever spent, or what!</p>", "8905": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, how about this? You know how you're always trying to learn about sarcasm?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was being sarcastic.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. Good for you.</p>", "8906": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, now that you're back on the team, let's get you caught up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Before you begin, let me say again how deeply sorry I am for my earlier behavior, and how much I respect and admire your leadership.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you. So as you can see, not only can you store your favorite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I must say, I am impressed.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thanks.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We have.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As a result, you have taken the most important step on the road to success, learning what not to do. Now, let's start fresh. Howard, we're going to need some tea.</p>", "8907": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, these are Uggs. These are Crocs. These are knockoff Manolo Blahniks.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Bored.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, you said it yourself, we have to create a database before you can write an alga-thingy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Algorithm. You see, Penny, Alan Turing defined an algorithm...<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Bored.</p>", "8908": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Ma, Ma, calm down. Listen to me. I know it says click with the mouse, but on a laptop, the trackpad is the mouse. Now, put your finger on it. Doesn't matter which finger. Good choice. Now move it down to your e-mail icon. Yeah, the little envelope. What do you mean, what does it look like? It looks like an envelope! Fine, you don't like the computer, don't use it! Sure, we can exchange it for a salad spinner. Goodbye!</p>", "8909": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, Leonard, that's actually a valid idea. Very good.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can you say that and not make it sound like I'm a cat who learned how to use the toilet?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. The two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable. Though if pressed, I'd have to give a slight edge to the cat.</p>", "8910": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer. I agree to be part of your project. Congratulations.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, yay for me.</br></p>", "8911": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, if I made more money, I could take time off from work and give pretty girls submarine rides.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What's that? Some weird sex thing?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No. You take pretty girls underwater in your private submarine, and you show them fish. Why does everything have to be dirty with you?</p>", "8912": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I checked the App Store. No one is doing handwriting recognition differential equation solving.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, dear Lord, shush.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You have so few good ideas, Leonard. And you're just going to spill the beans in front of an outsider?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Who, me?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, I don't think Penny cares about handwriting recognition-based differential...<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (singing over them) The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas.</p>", "8913": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> She's not going to steal our idea.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What idea?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We're gonna write an application...<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (singing) The prairie sky is wide and high, deep in the heart...<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, stop, stop!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Meekly) Of Texas.</p>", "8914": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Whatever your secret is, I'm sure it's boring, so I'm not interested.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not boring at all. You see, in higher order mathematics, there are certain sets of equations that...<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Bored.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Satisfied?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hardly. Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. A young woman alone in the big city, her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, wait a minute.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, hang on. Let's see where he's going.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Then it hits her. How is she going to survive? I mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills. And then one day, she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey...<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hang on. Let's see where he's going.</p>", "8915": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right. All right, I'm not going to argue with you. Sheldon Cooper is nothing if not a team player. Dr. Hofstadter, you have the conn.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you. I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, dear Lord, we're doomed.</p>", "8916": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So this button here will allow you to scan a new equation, but over here, you can press this and just substitute new values for the coefficients.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good one, boss.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This diagram. I assume you were opening with a joke. It certainly buoyed up this employee's esprit de corps.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not a joke. It's the real design.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In that case, may I offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing?</p>", "8917": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We're not wasting time with names right now.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I see. Is that decision open for discussion?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.</p>", "8918": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, Sheldon, stop it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together...</p>", "8919": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's enough, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, let's get right to the vote. Show of hands all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, that's it. You're fired.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? Why?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because you're impossible to work with.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I see. And is that open for discussion?</p>", "8920": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Good morning, shoemaker. I think you'll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But I fired you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I know. I'm now an independent contractor.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I made it better.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't want it better. I want it my way.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that speaks volumes, doesn't it?</p>", "8921": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, I'm still happy to drive you to work. Nothing's changed in that regard. We're still roommates. We're still friends.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Except you identified me, your best friend, as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away. The desperate act of a little man with a big Napoleon complex.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know what? Go put on your bus pants.</p>", "8922": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good morning, friend Howard, friend Raj. I see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages. Perhaps they would taste better out of these.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> \"World's Greatest Astrophysicist\"?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't thank me. You earned it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> \"Howard Wolowitz\". Why not \"World's Greatest Engineer\"?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry. I typed that into the label maker, but I just couldn't press enter.</p>", "8923": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> A few extra bucks would be nice. I could finally move out of my mother's house.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Where would you go?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I always dreamed about building a little place of my own over the garage.</p>", "8924": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now, down to business. What would it take for you to abandon Leonard and join me in a rival company? Unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient, in which case, welcome aboard.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We're not quitting on Leonard.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I understand. And your loyalty is admirable. But what if I were to up the ante?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What are you talking about?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Monogrammed key chains with a built-in laser pointer. No? How about can cosies emblazoned with our university mascot? Go Beavers!<br/>\nI'll be back.</p>", "8925": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She befriends them and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea, which she steals and sells to the highest bidder.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's ridiculous.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, is it? Well, let's see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, great. You know what? I've already mooched dinner off you guys. I don't need to listen to this.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> There's your answer: free food.</br></p>", "8926": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, let's try this one. Spherical Hankel function.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hold on. That's it!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Eureka!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, we agreed when it was Eureka time, we were all gonna say it together.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine. Let's say it together.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No. The moment has passed.</p>", "8927": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, why am I in charge of phone support? Seems a bit racist.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A customer service representative with an Indian accent will create the impression that we're a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centers.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, very clever. But still racist.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Duly noted, Steve from Wichita.</p>", "8928": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Greetings, gentlemen. How goes your little project?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You mean, Project Leonwoloppali?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah, a combination of all your names. Very clever. I assume Koothranardowitz was taken?</p>", "8929": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Why am I listed as your executive assistant?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because the word secretary has fallen into disrepute. FYI, my mother's birthday is coming up. I'm going to need you to pick up a present.</p>", "8930": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look at the organizational chart. You're clearly listed as founder.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, yes, and you're listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You missed Chief Science Officer, Chairman of the Board, and Head of the Secret Santa Committee.</p>", "8931": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, I suppose I'll go put on my bus pants.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What the hell are bus pants?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They are pants one wears over one's regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on. But perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder, you've lost touch with the struggles of the common man.</p>", "8932": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What you doing? Trying to contact your home planet?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm practicing my theremin.</p>", "8933": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, you don't need Leonard and his app. You can make one with me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> With you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Seriously, I have a great idea for one.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles and become a famous actress?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, look. When you see someone wearing shoes you like, you just snap a picture of them, and the app goes on the Internet to find out where you can buy them.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's your app idea?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, you don't like it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I didn't say that. But no, I don't.</p>", "8934": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Penny, where do I begin? The simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> And Leonard didn't want to work with you? Imagine that.</p>", "8935": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, I'm gonna make some cocoa. Do you want some?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you make it with milk or water?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Milk.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Real cocoa?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's what it says on the packet.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you have those little marshmallows?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, sorry.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I suppose it's appropriate.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What does that mean?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A disappointing drink for a disappointing day.</p>", "8936": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, look at this. Twenty people from the university have already signed up for our private beta.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm telling you, the Lenwoloppali Differential Equation Scanner meets a real need. We've got a hit.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What do you think we should sell it for?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, based on the fact that our potential market is about seventy or eighty guys, and you want a submarine, I'd say about a million dollars a pop.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, what if we put out a lite version for half a million? You know, get the word of mouth going.</p>", "8937": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hi. I'm sorry to bother you guys, but you've got to come take your Sheldon back.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's he doing in your apartment?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, he was moping down in the lobby, so I invited him over and now I regret it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why do you regret - Uh, never mind, stupid question.</p>", "8938": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, can't you just let him play with you until bedtime?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We're not playing. This is real work.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We're going to be hundred-aires.</p>", "8939": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn't want to eat with us tonight?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, I get it now.</p>", "8940": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> He just didn't really challenge me on an intellectual level.<br><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Couldn't you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wouldn't help. Zack couldn't even spell NPR.</br></p>", "8941": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> First of all, if we had superpowers, I wouldn't be the sidekick. You'd be the sidekick.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Rat-Man is nobody's sidekick.</p>", "8942": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What were the symptoms?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Localized to what region?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Ears and genitalia.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up.</p>", "8943": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Let me ask you a question. What are you afraid of?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know. Um, nuclear war. Accidentally being buried alive. Any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you're going to die, and then you do.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No. Something very specific that we both know you, Rajesh Koothrappali, are terrified of.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, type two diabetes runs in my family. The thought of losing a toe-<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Spiders! You're afraid of spiders.</p>", "8944": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, I am not going through menopause.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you sure? You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.</p>", "8945": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Isn't tomorrow your usual laundry night?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens, I'll need time to make things right.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's thinking ahead.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The alternative would be to think backwards. And that's just remembering.</p>", "8946": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night. None come to mind.</p>", "8947": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Excuse me, Zack? I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night. I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. And yet here I stand before you, one hundred and thirty pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make Shakespeare's metaphorical beast with two backs.<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> My gluteus what?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> On the other hand, as I look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face, I have decided to adopt the Vulcan practice of Kolinar. Goodbye, Zack.</p>", "8948": "<p><strong>Agent Page:</strong> I just want to ask you a few questions about Howard Wolowitz.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, all right. I doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved Oedipal complex.</p>", "8949": "<p><strong>Agent Page:</strong> Would you characterize him as responsible?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm going to answer this with a visual aid. This my nine-disc complete Lord of the Rings trilogy Blu-ray box-set. Mr Wolowitz borrowed it, damaged plastic retention hub number three, and then returned it to me hoping I wouldn't notice. Would you characterize that as responsible?<br/><strong>Agent Page:</strong> That's really not the kind of thing we're interested in.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You heard me say Blu-ray, right?</p>", "8950": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sleep eludes me, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? Maybe sleep has met you before.</p>", "8951": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, seriously, I think I've finally figured out my problem with women.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The capybara is the largest member of the rodent family.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What does that have to do with me and women?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nothing. It was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.</p>", "8952": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don\u2019t be ridiculous, Raj. You\u2019re here legally.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Nobody cares. Do you know how long it's been since I got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy?</p>", "8953": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, I try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative, but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, you squandered your time with me, and the moment has now passed. Feast on your disappointment, much as the capybara feasts on its own waste.</p>", "8954": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, when Howard said the FBI would be contacting me, I was expecting Mulder. Glad to see I got Scully.<br/><strong>Agent Page:</strong> Who?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mulder and Scully. X-Files. The truth is out there. Never mind.</p>", "8955": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Want to get that?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not particularly.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Could you get that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I suppose I could if I were asked.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Would you please get that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course. Why do you have to make things so complicated?</br></p>", "8956": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would you be interested in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck onto my World of Warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level-80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor?<br/><strong>Agent Page:</strong> I'm afraid not. Is there anything else?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is there anything else? Where would you like to start? He refuses to pay fines when he's overdue with books I lend him. He crashed the Mars Rover while attempting to impress a woman. He recommended that I go see the third Matrix movie because it was, and I quote, just as good as the first one. If that's not irresponsible, I don't know what is.<br/><strong>Agent Page:</strong> The Mars Rover?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did I say Mars Rover?<br/><strong>Agent Page:</strong> You did.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That was actually a poorly chosen example, as it had nothing to do with me.</p>", "8957": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why can't you sleep?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who knows? I haven't watched any scary movies recently. I'm no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe. And it's been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.</p>", "8958": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you for agreeing to see me, Agent Page.<br/><strong>Agent Page:</strong> Thank you for filing a complaint with my superior, Dr. Cooper. I understand you want to recant your statement about Howard Wolowitz.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Agent Page:</strong> Was your statement untrue?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Agent Page:</strong> Then I'm afraid you can't withdraw it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry. I don't recall you saying no backsies.</p>", "8959": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't understand why you people are picking on my friend, Howard, when there are much more serious security threats to pursue. For instance, when I first met Leonard, he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a North Korean spy, and not one agent ever investigated that.<br/><strong>Agent Page:</strong> This is Leonard Hofstadter?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, it's a different Leonard. He's Chinese, red hair, six fingers. Good-bye.</p>", "8960": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm sorry, honey, I don't know milliliters.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah. Blame President James \u201cJimmy\u201d Carter. He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. He wonders why he was a one-term president.</p>", "8961": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let\u2019s see. Harvey Wallbanger. Eh. Sex on the Beach. I hardly think so. Rob Roy, Silk Slipper, Mad Hatter. Ooh! I'll have a Rosewater Ricky.</p>", "8962": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, sometimes stuff just happens, and there's nothing you can do about it. For example, Lisa Peterson hasn't talked to me since the 11th grade, because no matter how much you apologize, you can't go back and un-dry-hump someone's boyfriend.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I see. You're saying I'm facing Starfleet Academy's unwinnable command scenario, the Kobayashi Maru.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Exactly. Sometimes you can't win.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Captain Kirk won.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Kirk cheated.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Impressive that you know that. It's hard to believe I'm actually having this conversation with you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Right there with you.</p>", "8963": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard, you're feeling better about me today, aren't you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Not really.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, you are. I'm using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. Go away, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's a nine-ninety-five e-book down the drain.</p>", "8964": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I have a girlfriend now.<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> Hey, good for you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, I just wanna put it out there in case I inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction.</p>", "8965": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? You're going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your themodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.</p>", "8966": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sorry.<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> For what?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. When I'm in bed with a girl, it's just it's my go to response.</p>", "8967": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> \"Leonard, call me if you're interested in coitus. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary.\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And if anyone were to actually call that number, they will hear this: \"Top of the mornin' to you. You've reached Maggie McGeary. Leave a message after the wee little beep.\"</p>", "8968": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And here is the clincher, a lock of Maggie's flaming auburn hair.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where did you get that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> From an orangutan in the primate lab.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> An orangutan?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, no one's going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard. Honestly, you over think everything.</p>", "8969": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey guys, guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me. I object. You propose a guessing game, yet you don't give me enough time to guess. For the record, I was going to say your sister Priya.</p>", "8970": "<p><strong>Priya:</strong> Oh, Sheldon. You haven't changed a bit, have you?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why would I change?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The hope has been that you'd eventually bend to public opinion.</br></p>", "8971": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, Priya, what brings you back to LA?<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> I have a one day layover on my way to Toronto. Corporate merger.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Can you believe it? Little Priya's one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, it's actually extremely plausible.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And your poll numbers just keep dropping.</p>", "8972": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, I've got a girlfriend now.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh please. My sister's much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Let's just agree theyre both hot.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Dude, that's my sister you're talking about.</p>", "8973": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, forget who's hotter. The first time Priya came to LA, Leonard and I made a pact out of respect to our friendship, and to you, that neither of us would hit on her.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Did you pinky swear?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay then.</p>", "8974": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, what are talking about?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, my plans with Priya.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He rejected train day.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did you make it clear that it's two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Abundantly.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I guess he just hates fun.</p>", "8975": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You are in a forest. There is quicksand to the west, a path leads to the east. Go east. An iron gate blocks your way. Open gate. It's locked. Hmm, well, so much for that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's getting pretty late, how come you're still up?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's pretty cool.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh yes. It runs on the world's most powerful graphics chip, imagination.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You've really got to get out more.</p>", "8976": "<p><strong>Priya:</strong> Can't you get rid of him?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If the past is any indication, no.</p>", "8977": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, I'm trapped in quicksand. The axe is dragging me down.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Drop axe.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Drop axe. Brilliant!</p>", "8978": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who was at the door?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, uh, building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's unacceptable. We're supposed to be given written notice.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, no, it doesn't matter, we'll be at work.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change, only to find there's no water for an enzyme soak.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.</p>", "8979": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I wish you could stay in LA a while longer.<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> Mmm. Me too.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, I was thinking, there are some great research facilities in India.<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> Where are you going with this, Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I'm just saying, I don't have any real ties here, so if I were to move to New Delhi we could, you know, go out.<br/><strong>Priya:</strong> Leonard, didn't we have this conversation five years ago.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, yes, but, things have changed. You know, you're older, I'm older. Look, no more superhero bedsheets.</p>", "8980": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I heard a woman laughing.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, uh, yeah, I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Well, good job, quite convincing. I smell perfume.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Air freshener.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, rash, that's a bad rash.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My sympathies. I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Very well, I'm sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch.</p>", "8981": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you prefer ointment or cream?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, cream.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> With or without a numbing agent?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Without.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? Leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fine. With.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Prescription or non-prescription strength.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Use your best judgment.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC. It's usually indicated for acutely inflamed hemorrhoids, but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sounds great.<br/><br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excellent choice.</p>", "8982": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Making pretty good time, huh?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is that really what you want to talk about, Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What do you want to talk about?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Please don't tell anyone I spent the night with Raj's sister.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There it is. What if someone asks?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No-one's going to ask if I spent the night with Raj's sister.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perhaps. But they might ask me something else.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Like what?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Like, has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?</p>", "8983": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Priya and I are both adults. We didn't betray Raj.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In fact, you did, but I was referring to Howard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you talking about?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> April 12th, 2005, Bobs Big Boy, Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob's Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship, you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And Raj.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Alright, and Raj.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause.</p>", "8984": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> My point is, Priya's gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You mean, you want me to keep a secret?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know I can't keep a secret.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You can if you try. Think about it this way, if I were Batman and you were Alfred, you'd keep that secret. Right?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why do you get to be Batman?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because, well, Batman has the secret.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well Alfred has secrets too.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Like what?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Which I've now just told to Batman. See, I can't keep a secret.</p>", "8985": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ta-da!<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> What.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ta-da. It's short for da-da-da-da!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Kind of busy here, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know, that's why I shortened it.</br></p>", "8986": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I came to go over your alibi for last night.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What alibi?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You've asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so I've provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldn't have spent last night with Priya, because you were with another woman.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I'm so sure I'm going to regret this, but, who was I with?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The fun loving, and morally loose, Miss Maggie McGeary.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, God.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You met her at Pasadena's most popular Irish watering hole, Lucky Baldwin's, where Maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (reading a napkin that Sheldon gave to him) Leonard, call me if you're interested in coitus. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this. (Robotic voice with an Irish accent from Sheldon's phone) Top of the morning to you. You've reached Maggie McGeary. Leave a message after the wee little beep.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's pretty convincing, huh? And it wasn't even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggie's flaming auburn hair.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where did you get that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> An orang-u-tan?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, no-one's going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard, honestly you over-think everything.</p>", "8987": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, Leonard, will you please tell Howard my sister's never been attracted to him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> C'mon Raj, how am I supposed to know who she's attracted to? Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya's preferences in male companionship. And with that, I will re-zip my lip.</p>", "8988": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, so what did you guys think of the new episode of Caprica last night?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I didn't see it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Didn't see it? What were you doing?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, I was out.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> On Caprica night?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, I, uh, went for a drink.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really, you, and where, where did you go?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> To, uh, Lucky Baldwin's.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I've heard of that place. Isn't that Pasadena's favorite Irish watering hole?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> As a matter of fact I-I-I can't. I can't. I can't do it.</p>", "8989": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, I'm sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't listen to him, he's still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system.</p>", "8990": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What were you doing with Priya?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?</p>", "8991": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> May I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying Maggie McGeary, she sounds lovely.</p>", "8992": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't believe it. This is a terrible betrayal of my trust.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, no, no, would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How hard did she stomp?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Very hard.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, I'm good.</p>", "8993": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, well, Raj, I just want to say that I'd never betray your trust. Unlike Leonard, I respect you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Mmm.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Was it out of respect that you didn't tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Dude! I put that thing on my face!</p>", "8994": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think a more amusing violation of Rajs trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, I didn't see you giving back your Snoopy snowcone maker.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That was all a lie? This year's gifts are already wrapped!</p>", "8995": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> And as long as we're talking about betraying our friends, how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonards food.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, excuse me. That was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You put moths in my food?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For science.</p>", "8996": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> As long as we're apologising, Sheldon, I-I'm sorry I used your toothbrush.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And I'm sorry. But that behavior is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated. We are no longer friends.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> With real puffing smoke?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Alright. But I'm watching you.</p>", "8997": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, you got Snoopy out. Can I have a snowcone?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, sure.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> These are pretty god, what flavor is this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Guess.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Papaya?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Guava?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're so close.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I give up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mango, caterpillar. (Leonard spits it out) What are you doing? You said you liked it!</p>", "8998": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So you're still just texting and emailing? You don't feel any need to hang out with her, you know, be in the same room?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, you are my best friend. I've known you for seven years, and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler.</p>", "8999": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I sense judgment on your part.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, no. Maybe a little.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female. You have none.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, right. That.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster, not unlike the Hulk, who, by the way, also has a girlfriend. In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly, whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, a feel-good romp if there ever was one.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm not jealous.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hurgh! Leonard not jealous.</p>", "9000": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What makes you chuckle, Leonard?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hmm, recently? Not much.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman, and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Um, shut up.</br></p>", "9001": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, when my grandfather died, and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a center three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. It's very nice. They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That sounds lovely.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It is if you like bridge. Do you like bridge, Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, I'm just not dating someone right now. I don't need to go to a senior center.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Fine. If I don't meet someone soon, you can put me in a home.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not a home. It's a senior center.  We'd never put Meemaw in a home!</p>", "9002": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> (Cell phone rings) Excuse me. That's my girlfriend, Bernadette. I assigned her her own ringtone, Bernadette by The Four Tops. Hello, Bernadette.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> When I call him, his phone plays Brown Eyed Girl. Which, now that I think about it, is not so good.</p>", "9003": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard? Are you sleeping?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you ill?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you still depressed because you're alone, and no one loves you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. Maybe.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I want you to know that I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're welcome. But it's still no reason to have your feet in my spot.</p>", "9004": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> (via a webcam) May I offer an observation?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What the hell? How long has she been here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Since we got home from the comic bookstore.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That was two hours ago.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As per your suggestion, we're hanging out. Quite frankly, I don't see what all the hoopla's about.</p>", "9005": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> From a neurobiological standpoint, Leonard, you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation.</p>", "9006": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I understand that some people find mates in social gathering places such as bars or taverns. Have you tried a bar or tavern?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I'm not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wise decision. You see, Amy, success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height, strength, attractiveness, the ability to hold one's liquor and throw darts, separately or together. Leonard has none of these attributes, right, Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Right.</p>", "9007": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> That was rude.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He does it all the time. He's a cornucopia of social awkwardness.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Cornucopia. What a mellifluous word.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let's make that our word of the day.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Agreed. And we'll use mellifluous tomorrow.</p>", "9008": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't want the next level. I like this level. Fix it for me!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Me? Well, how am I supposed to fix it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Simple! You want a girlfriend, Amy wants to be someone's girlfriend. Take her off my hands. I give you my blessing.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That is insane.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're right. It would never work. Amy finds you tedious.</p>", "9009": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What's with the T-shirt? You working at the Apple store now?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, it's just something I threw on.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I know all your shirts. That's not one of them. You were pretending to work at the Genius Bar to pick up women, weren't you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. Turns out, they guard the iPods, but they don't guard the shirts.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So, how'd it go?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in the mall.</p>", "9010": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Just FYI, don't try to go back with a fake moustache. I mean, they may not really be geniuses, but they see right through that.</p>", "9011": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I'm off to meet Bernadette's friend. How do I look?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd amount of hair gel.</p>", "9012": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you working on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler can't find me and compel me to meet her mother.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ah, you're going off the grid.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Exactly.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.</p>", "9013": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, I take pacts very seriously. One time at my lab, a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing. That day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed Ebola with the common cold.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why the hell would you cross Ebola with the common cold?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We never did. That would be a terrible, terrible thing.</p>", "9014": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when I asked you to meet my mother.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No misunderstanding. I've learned what that request actually means, and I don't want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> In what way are you screwed?</p>", "9015": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I trust this clarification allows us to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course. Would you like to join me for Chinese food?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, please, you're suffocating me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My apologies. Good night, Amy.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Good night, Sheldon.</br></p>", "9016": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, it's like if Alien and Predator decided to go partners in a Jamba Juice.</p>", "9017": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They do some of their best work at night.</p>", "9018": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.</p>", "9019": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, I see what's going on. This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. Well titted.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong>Stand by for my upcoming tat.</p>", "9020": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I think I'm gonna take her to miniature golf.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ah, well, I guess for you guys that's like regular golf.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Short jokes? Really? You're like a quarter of an inch taller than me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, and don't you forget it.</p>", "9021": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light, then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, well, if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light, then you'd be correct. Also, pigs would fly, my derrire would produce cotton candy, and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic.</p>", "9022": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I'd ask you guys if you want dessert, but I know Sheldon doesn't eat dessert on Tuesdays. And even if Raj wanted something, he couldn't tell me. Howard won't order anything, but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. And Leonard's lactose intolerant, so he can't eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hang on a second. I could have the fruit platter.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You want the fruit platter?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Does it have melon on it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I can't eat melon.</p>", "9023": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, Howard, heads up. Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> When was the last time you saw her?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, not since we broke up. Wow. How am I going to play this? Sophisticated and relaxed? Friendly, noncommittal? Cold and distant? (Hides under the table)</p>", "9024": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello. I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's one of his best moves.</p>", "9025": "<p>Mrs. <strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Howard, have you seen my girdle?!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, Ma!<br/>\nMrs. <strong>Wolowitz:</strong> I can't find it, and I'm late for my Weight Watchers meeting!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Maybe it committed suicide!</p>", "9026": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So you want to get back together with her, but you're too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> In a nutshell.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay. Well, how about this? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn't know it's you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Now, you see, I don't know if you're kidding or not.</p>", "9027": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You're being unreasonable. Why can't I have a desk?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Our collaboration is a work of the mind. We don't need desks.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You have a desk.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Correct.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> But I can't have one.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're two for two.</p>", "9028": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why can't he have a desk, Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Lord, will this day never end? As I've explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it's convenient, there's absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, but there's money for a drawer full of Red Vines, a marshmallow shooting rifle, and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.</p>", "9029": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, all right. He can buy his own desk.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And I can put it in your office?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, you really want to dot the Is and cross the Ts, don't you?</p>", "9030": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I just have a question. Does Bernadette ever talk about me?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, absolutely.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She does?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, sure. Just yesterday, she asked, why is Howard hiding under the table?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She saw that, huh?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, no, not at first. Right after I pointed it out.</br></p>", "9031": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, while we're on the subject, why did you guys break up anyway?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, I'd rather not say.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Howard, if you want my help, I've got to know what happened.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But it's embarrassing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, that's what I'm counting on.</p>", "9032": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, you know World of Warcraft?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Um, the online game? Sure.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, God. I think I see where this is going.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Her name was Glacinda the Troll. Bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the Bridge of Souls.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, you're right. That is so embarrassing.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Would you talk to her?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Bernadette or the troll?</p>", "9033": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Will you talk to her, see if there's any chance at all we could get back together?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, gee, Howard, I really don't want to get in the middle of this.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No. Why would you? I'm just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can. You know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, I will think about it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, I've always blamed myself for him leaving. I always thought it was because I wasn't the son he wanted.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I said I'd think about it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I wasn't athletic, yeah, I was kind of sickly.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, fine. Look, look, I'm calling her now! See?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thank you.</p>", "9034": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This isn't a desk. This is a Brobdingnagian monstrosity.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Is that the American idiom for giant, big-ass desk?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's actually British.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Can you say it again for me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Brobdingnagian.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> One more time?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Brobdingnagian.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Now three times fast?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna-</p>", "9035": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How did you even get it in here?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's for me, Ramon, Julio, Jesus and Rodrigo to know and you to find out.</p>", "9036": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> How have you been?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Okay. You know, busy, school, work. You?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Same. I took a scuba-diving course over the summer, but it turns out I'm terrified of the ocean.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Too bad.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You wouldn't know anybody who wants to buy a wet suit, boy's large? Yeah, forget it. Not important.</p>", "9037": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, fine. I'll admit, there are dark, sordid little corners of the Internet where the name Wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones. But the only reason I go there, the only reason I've ever gone there is because I don't have a real woman in my life. You happy?</p>", "9038": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, this is a little awkward, but my manager says I can't actually give nachos away. So, just take that [bill] when you're ready.</p>", "9039": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, we had a really great talk, and we're gonna start seeing each other again.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, congratulations. Have you broken it to the troll yet?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Did Penny tell you about that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. Steve Patterson told me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The greasy old fat guy in Facilities Management?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> How\u2019d he know about it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He's Glacinda the troll.</p>", "9040": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you doing in there?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas. Just a little experiment in pest control.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's not gonna work, dude. I grew up in India, an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street, and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, we'll just see how long you can hold out.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, we'll just see how your noxious gas fares against my cinnamon-apple-scented aroma therapy candles.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Didn't you say you're making hydrogen sulphide gas?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Isn't that flammable?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Highly. Oh, dear. [explosion]</p>", "9041": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Penny, dear, why don't you shoot another silver bullet my way?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Get one yourself.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ooh, somebody's been taking bitchy pills.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> God, he's an ass when he drinks.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, he's an ass when he doesn't. You just don't hear it.</p>", "9042": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I brought Amy here to show her some of the work I'm doing.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's very impressive, for theoretical work.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do I detect a hint of condescension?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm sorry, was I being too subtle? I meant compared to the real-world applications of neurobiology, theoretical physics is - what's the word I'm looking for? Hmm, cute.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clerk Maxwell or Dirac?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm stating it outright. Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast and defecates Clerk Maxwell.</p>", "9043": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You slipped and fell into a robot hand?<br/><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Yes<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Penis first?<br/><strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Yes!</p>", "9044": "<p><strong>Althea:</strong> Why is it hooked up to a computer?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, it's what controls the arm.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But it's frozen.<br/><strong>Althea:</strong> Did you try turning it off and back on again?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, you see, it's more complicated than that. (Althea switches off computer) No, wait! (The robot hand lets go) Winnie the Pooh is out of the honey tree.</p>", "9045": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, next question. Kirk or Picard?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, uh, well, that's tricky. Um, well, uh, Original Series over Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Correct. You've passed the first barrier to roommate-hood. You may enter.</br></p>", "9046": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, this is pretty nice. Uh, the bedrooms are back there?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That depends.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't understand, their, their existence is conditional?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional on you passing the second and third barriers.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> There's three?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Each more daunting than the last. Have a seat.</p>", "9047": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's correct. FYI, I would have accepted any answer other than procreating. Come, I'll show you the rest of the apartment.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, good. I passed the barriers.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The second barrier. Don't get cocky.</p>", "9048": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Third barrier passed. You have won the right to see your room. Huzzah!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is this it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, this is my room. People don't go in my room.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So where do you sleep?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't understand.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If people don't go in there, and you're people, and\u2026 You are people, aren't you? Making a joke.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you do this often?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> On occasion.</p>", "9049": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved for watching Joss Whedon's brilliant new series Firefly.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Does that really need to be in the agreement?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We might as well settle it now, it's going to be on for years.</p>", "9050": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Section nine, miscellany. The apartment's flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We have a flag?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Never fly it upside down unless the apartment's in distress.</p>", "9051": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And next, if either of us ever invents time travel, we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay. [They look around, nothing happens]<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well that's disappointing.</p>", "9052": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Why on earth did you agree to all that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It was the best apartment I'd seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you've passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I'm sorry, Leonard, it's very hard to feel sympathy for you.</p>", "9053": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Knock * 3) Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Shh. Just pretend we're not here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Knock * 3) Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sure he'll go away.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm just going to keep knocking till you answer. (Knock * 3) Leonard? (Knock * 3) Leonard? (Knock * 3) Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you want? I didn't say come in!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You asked what I wanted. I wanted to come in. I'm here because you violated our roommate agreement. Specifically, section eight, visitors, subsection C, females, paragraph four, coitus. Roommates shall give each other 12 hours notice of impending coitus.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I didn't even know her 12 hours ago.<br/><strong>Joyce Kim:</strong> That's it! I'm out of here!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But, Joyce, come on.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> 12 hours? [Looking judgmentally]</p>", "9054": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do I get some sympathy now?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> A little bit. Okay. Let me get this straight. You move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while you're doing this Joyce Kim, and you still stay?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Actually, I couldn't get too mad at him about Joyce Kim.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. It's kind of secret.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What does that have to do with Joyce Kim?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I'm not saying I would have.</p>", "9055": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> There you go, three against one.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They don't get a vote. It's one against one. And according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But I said no to that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And I said yes. And I settle all ties.</p>", "9056": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not only did Sheldon save my life, he didn't rat me out to the landlord. Or the police. Or Homeland Security.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, so, basically, you're the reason I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?</p>", "9057": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, if we lived in a tea kettle.</p>", "9058": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So Sheldon's last roommate tried to warn you off?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> For all I knew, he was the crazy one. He had this really deranged look.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, yeah. He'd been living with Sheldon.</p>", "9059": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's where I sit.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's the difference?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer. It also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation. As a result, I've placed it in a state of eternal dibs.</p>", "9060": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Cathedra mea, regulae meae. That's Latin for my chair, my rules.</p>", "9061": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Last question. In a post-apocalyptic world, which task would you assign the highest priority? Locating a sustainable food source, re-establishing a functioning government, procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, I'm gonna go with preserving the knowledge.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's correct. FYI, I would have accepted any answer other than procreating.</br></p>", "9062": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I did notify you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, you did, did you? Oh, drat. Hoisted by my own spam filter.</p>", "9063": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, let me get my jacket.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're not going with us.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You're the guy we're trying to get away from.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh. Well, in that case, I don't need my jacket. And for the record, the correct syntax is I'm the guy from whom you're trying to get away.</p>", "9064": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Leonard, I have something for you. Per our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course. Pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, cybernetically enhanced helper monkeys.</p>", "9065": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, she doesn't care for hotels. And who can blame here? Windows that don't open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one's wallet.</p>", "9066": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A word of warning. My guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology, so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Female jibber jabber?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks, gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, they're not my friends.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not surprised, considering the way you talk about them behind their backs.</p>", "9067": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In here you'll find emergency provisions. An eight-day supply of food and water, a crossbow, season two of Star Trek: The Original Series on a high-density flash drive.<br/><strong>Elizabeth:</strong> What if there's a disaster that destroys all the USB ports?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Then there's really no reason to live, is there?</p>", "9068": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Go away. She wants New Delhi, not Kosher deli.</p>", "9069": "<p>*Raj sneezes*<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hold.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Explain your sneeze.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm sorry?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you have allergies?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is there too much pepper on your salad?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't put pepper on salads.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've heard enough. Sit over there.</p>", "9070": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Guys, help me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, come on.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, it's just one sneeze. (Raj sneezes again) You're on your own.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> See you, buddy.</p>", "9071": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> The cosmological physicist from Princeton?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. And until you acquire a surgical mask, please address your comments to me through a napkin.</p>", "9072": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why didn't you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton? I am a huge fan of hers!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I didn't realize I was obligated to share my connection with things you're a fan of, but very well. You enjoy Canadian bacon. I've been to Toronto.</p>", "9073": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> When can I sit with you again?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When I've seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart. You know the drill. All right, if you'll excuse me, I am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics.</p>", "9074": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Penny, excellent. I have a question about these maxi pads. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What? What are you doing with, what?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject.</p>", "9075": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I want her to feel at home. I also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, wait, hold on, back up. You're having a woman stay with you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm not flabbergasted. I'm puzzled. Yeah, let's go with puzzled.</br></p>", "9076": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hi-lo. Oops. I started to say hi and then I switched to hello in the middle. It came out hi-lo. Duh. Uh, it's nice to meet you. I've read both your books and most of your papers. I'm Leonard, I live here. You're brilliant.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I apologize. He's only an experimental physicist.<br/>\nElizabeth: No need to apologize. Some of my best friends are experimental physicists. Well, not my best friends, but I know them. My best friend is a molecular chemist named Wendy. I'm sorry, I'm rambling. Hi-lo.</p>", "9077": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> (To Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton) I think any university would want you. Except, of course, any university that had already had you. Because they would've already wanted you before they, you know, got you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> From the mind that brought you hi-lo.</p>", "9078": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, let me show you some of the features of the room. First, windows. Conventional. Open, closed, open, closed. Halfway open or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent. Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse. There's a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand.</p>", "9079": "<p>Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton: Can I ask a question about your roommate?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He's an odd duck, isn't he?<br/>\nDr. Elizabeth Plimpton: What's his relationship status?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. It ended as inexplicably as it began. They had very little in common, except for carnal activity. That's why I acquired these noise-canceling headphones. If you decide to use them, please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes you'll find in the bathroom. They're in the drawer labeled Wet Wipes.</p>", "9080": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Vocal test. Morning vocal test. Second vocal test. Second morning vocal test.</p>", "9081": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours. The seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection.<br/>\nDr. Elizabeth Plimpton: That's very thoughtful, but I think I'll finish my coffee first.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Ah, so the yogurt didn't work. I'll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer.</p>", "9082": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, good, you're up. Look, my car won't start. I need a ride to work.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did you once again ignore your check engine light?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, Mr. Smarty Pants. I ignored the fill gas tank light.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work.</p>", "9083": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know what? I'm just gonna take the bus to work.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny, I can still drive you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, no, no, it's okay. You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant.</p>", "9084": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I must say, I'm shocked by this betrayal.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I didn't betray Penny.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not Penny, me!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How am I betraying you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Elizabeth's my friend, and you're playing with her!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, I guess I did.</p>", "9085": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What the hell are you doing?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Relax, it's Nyquil.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You still have a cold?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Maybe, but I don't care. That's the great thing about Nyquil, it's like ten-percent booze. I call it the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing, so you can talk to girls medicine.</p>", "9086": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, here\u2019s the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.</p>", "9087": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm glad we're still friends.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I'd hate for that effort to have been in vain.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Right.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Everyone.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Harsh terms. But all right, I'll just substitute intercourse.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Great.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I'll hold that in reserve.</p>", "9088": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> How's Leonard doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'll pretend I didn't hear it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'd rather you pretend I didn't say it.</p>", "9089": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yep.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that's what the Romans made Jesus eat.</p>", "9090": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Why don't you give me an hour and come over?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't have hot dogs.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, it's all right, I do. Oh. You're in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat.</br></p>", "9091": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You're either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Which one picks last?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, usually I'm on the team that picks last. Unless there's a kid in a wheelchair.</p>", "9092": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you're hungry.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, of course I'm hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. Why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just making dinner conversation.</p>", "9093": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Certainly. It's not like I have to moderate my food intake because I'm planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!</p>", "9094": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What about you, Raj?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, there it is. Now that you don't have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I never stopped hanging out with you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, please, we all know I'm the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I'd be Aquaman.</p>", "9095": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So what, you're just gonna walk up and down the stairs?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.</p>", "9096": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Do I smell hot dogs?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I definitely smell raw hot dog.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perhaps you're getting a brain tumor.</p>", "9097": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't worry. You'll meet a girl someday.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, I won't.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, you will, and she'll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You really think so?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I do, and you'll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she'll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> But we'll have sex first, right?</p>", "9098": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I'm fine, I don't care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, good.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm also pleased to report that he's all cried out over you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> He's been crying?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn't supposed to mention.</p>", "9099": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, God, I feel terrible.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you have a stomach ache, too?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No. Why, do you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why did you ask if I had one, too?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.</p>", "9100": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right. So, what's new in your life?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, my new shoes are not made for running.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Have you been running?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. It's just a suspicion I have.</p>", "9101": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mmm, mmm, mmm.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm so glad you like it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I do. Leonard never cooks for me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, maybe that's 'cause Leonard can't cook.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You can't cook and you made me this.</p>", "9102": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, I'm gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Lord, I'm in Jewish hell.</p>", "9103": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I got lost.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Satellites are down. Solar flares.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> There are no solar flares right now.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, there are.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Dude, I'm an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I'd be all up in it.</p>", "9104": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, just come in!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you want, Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Maybe this isn't a good time.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.</p>", "9105": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And now, as promised, the tangent. \"Sheldon and the Hell Hound\", or \"How I Lost My Hot Dogs\".</p>", "9106": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Is there anything else?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, don't let Goofy near him. He'll have nightmares and I'll have to deal with it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What's the problem with Goofy?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wish I knew. He's fine with Pluto.</br></p>", "9107": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, that's it. We're officially out of things to talk about.</p>", "9108": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> He's such an angel when he's asleep.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I think we can do it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn't that be wrong?</p>", "9109": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was going to get my mail.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay. Are you hoping to get it telepathically?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasn't sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.</p>", "9110": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm glad we're still friends.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I'd hate for that effort to have been in vain.</p>", "9111": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You're just coitusing with me, aren't you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Bazinga!</p>", "9112": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, since when do you take walks?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increase serotonin. And you know me, if there's one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it's serotonin. Bye-bye.</p>", "9113": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So what, you're just gonna walk up and down the stairs?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.</p>", "9114": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Look at this. Do you think she's really doing that or is it PhotoShop?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japense guys.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You don't know that. Prison changes people.</p>", "9115": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug. Time to bowl! Yes, I was eavesdropping. There's a lot at stake here.</p>", "9116": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> I, um, I want you to know that even though we're on opposite sides, I, I bear you no ill will.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thank you, Stuart. It's nice to know.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> People from opposite sides often have good relationships. You know, Romeo and Juliet, Tony and Maria from West Side Story, what's-his-name and the big blue chick in Avatar. ... I'm gonna bowl now.</p>", "9117": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What are you talking about?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He's evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you his grandmother died?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, if he does, don't believe it. He's not above playing the dead meemaw card.</p>", "9118": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, my God. I'm lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda. I love you, Penny.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. Oh. Thank you.</p>", "9119": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, Leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a Batmobile.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant.</p>", "9120": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Seriously? You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?<br><strong>Howard:</strong> What's with him?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perhaps he's at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Are you saying he's man-struating?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men's hormone levels.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Interesting. That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. You know what I'm talking about.</br></p>", "9121": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I honestly don't care.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really? Because every time we've talked about unusual animal genitals, you've always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions.</p>", "9122": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you want from me? I just don't give a rat's ass.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Would that be a giant rat's ass?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For the record, giant rats are possible.</p>", "9123": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, how about this for a topic, why is Leonard being a giant douche? Assuming giant douches are possible.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course they are. Leonard's being one.</p>", "9124": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Maybe he's having a lover's spat with Penny.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, there was no spat.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, but something happened.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't want to talk about it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I sense you're going to and I don't want to hear about it. Excuse me.</p>", "9125": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What'd you do, Romeo? You pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around, but it wound up just creeping her out?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What? No.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm just asking, dude. It happens.</p>", "9126": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> You guys still on for bowling tonight?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, yes. In fact, I've prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh. Ouch.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That is what is referred to as a burn on you.</p>", "9127": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Did you ask her to start waxing?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Did you start waxing?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> While making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out Mommy?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm walking away from you now.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That wasn't a no.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, I think we're getting close.</p>", "9128": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Did you take a Benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her? Because you can die that way.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, that would be a good way to go.</p>", "9129": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven o'clock.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, right. Bowling.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You don't have to come if you don't want to.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, no, it's okay. I mean, let's face it, you guys would get creamed without me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We would indeed. In this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It's always nice chatting with you, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sarcasm?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thinly veiled contempt.</p>", "9130": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Remember, seven o'clock.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Got it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Pacific Daylight time!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Bite me!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.</p>", "9131": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> These are my own bowling shoes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Then what's with the disinfectant?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know where my feet have been.</p>", "9132": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how its really done.</p>", "9133": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Ah, the premature \"I love you\".<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I guessed premature. Does that count?</p>", "9134": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is for you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ice cream?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she's upset, she says Ack! and eats ice cream.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Um, Ack!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna.</p>", "9135": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Did Leonard send you over here?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, we haven't spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I'm sorry about that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.</br></p>", "9136": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're kidding.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.</p>", "9137": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We don't have to talk 'cause there's nothing to talk about. Everything's good.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? So, you didn't get all snarky 'cause I said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?</p>", "9138": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, maybe I overreacted. So we're in two different places emotionally. So what? And maybe I'm a little ahead of you. That's fine. You know. In fact, it makes sense, 'cause let's face it, I've been in this relationship two years longer than you.</p>", "9139": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We think we can help you with your stage fright.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I doubt that. I haven't figured out a way, and I'm much smarter than all of you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes, but you're not smarter than all of us put together.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry, that is what I meant.</p>", "9140": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, it's about time. I'm starving.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, well, we didn't actually get Chinese food.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't panic, this is better.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, no, you didn't trade the food for magic beans, did you?</p>", "9141": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course not. And, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, sometimes I dont listen, sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down.</p>", "9142": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> We got this whole box for sixty bucks.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We didn't even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> There a new girlfriend in there? 'cause you might need one.</p>", "9143": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains! (Raj whispers to Leonard) Oh, you're right, it's Ghostbusters 2. Never mind.</p>", "9144": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, I'm just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony.</p>", "9145": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Anyway, he said this isn't a replica. It's the real deal.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you're suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom, I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement.</p>", "9146": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Mine!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, yes, but I found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How is this maritime salvage?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Other than the lack of water, how is it not?</p>", "9147": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, that's a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why do you want a jet ski?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That can't just be a coincidence.</p>", "9148": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We can't sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's sad how great that sounds.</p>", "9149": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Guys, it's stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine. He can have it back as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> There are no Jewish hobbits.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Clearly, you've never been to my house for dinner on Rosh Hashanah.</p>", "9150": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, where's the ring?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You mean my ring?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did.</br></p>", "9151": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, guys. Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, it's delicious. The sarcasm's a little stale, though.</p>", "9152": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's a prop from a movie, and were kind of fighting over it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewelery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and I don't even get to keep it?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> If you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, youd have my great Aunt Ida's brooch that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat.</p>", "9153": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So, Sheldon, how's it feel to get beaten up by a girl?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong>  It's not the first time. I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero. If only I'd had the presence of mind to reabsorb her, then I'd have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter.</p>", "9154": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.</p>", "9155": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You want to talk about endless patience? Penny made me watch all five seasons of Sex and the City.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> There are six seasons, dude.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, crap!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, no, no, the sixth season is great. We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken, and then Mr. Big shows up, we don't know if we can trust him again. It's a wild ride.</p>", "9156": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I think it's lovely you call your mommy and let her know you're going to be late for dinner. From what I know about these things, if a woman doesn't breast-feed on time, it's very uncomfortable for her boobies.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't you talk about my mother\u2019s boobies!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> If you're offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mother's boobies.</p>", "9157": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why don't you go after Raj's mother?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why don't we go after your mother?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything you'd like to add?</p>", "9158": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Waterfalls!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Subliminal messaging. I'm going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's not working, dude.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh-ho-ho, it's working all right. I have to pee.</p>", "9159": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've decided that I'm going to have Mr. Lee sign my copy of this month's Batman.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's crazy. Stan Lee had nothing to do with Batman.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and I will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artefact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom</p>", "9160": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because most of the things I'm planning to buy haven't been invented yet.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But there must be thousands of dollars here. Why don't you put it in the bank?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't trust banks. I believe that when the robots rise up, ATMs will lead the charge.</p>", "9161": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, look, they sent me the ticket. I told them I wasn't driving and they were all, if it wasn't you, who was it?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So you betrayed me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, it wasn't a betrayal. It was more of a can't afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.</p>", "9162": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I can't wait to ask Stan Lee why he insists on giving all his characters first and last names that start with the same letter.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, come on, why would you do that?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Bruce Banner, Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Stephen Strange, Otto Octavius, Silver Surfer, Peter Parker. Oh, and worst of all, J. Jonah Jameson, Jr.</p>", "9163": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look at that. To my friend, Leonard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Awesome. Mine says, \"To my friend, Howard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!\"<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Mine says, \"To Raj, from Stan Lee.\"<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's 'cause you pissed him off about his character names.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, I didn't even mention Dum Dum Dugan, or Green Goblin, Matt Murdock, Pepper Potts, Victor von Doom. Oh, and worst of all, Millie the Model.</p>", "9164": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Invincible Iron Man, Happy Hogan, Curt Connors.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Would you just let it go?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And worst of all, Fin Fang Foom.</p>", "9165": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, Stuart, what's going on?<br><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, you might want to mark your Google calendars. Stan Lee is coming to do a signing on Thursday.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography? I'm sure ages 79 through 87 were just action-packed.</br></p>", "9166": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> No, just a regular comic signing. My uncle is his dermatologist and Stan's doing him a favor.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I don't want to know that! How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, look who thinks he's Stuart's uncle now.</p>", "9167": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why don't you keep that stuff in the bathroom?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine.</p>", "9168": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, who's Stan Lee?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Um, he was on Star Trek.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Nope.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Star Wars?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Um, uh, Stan Lee, oh, he was in those goofy kung fu movies you love so much?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's Bruce Lee.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. So, is this Bruce Lee's nerdy brother, Stan?</p>", "9169": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You've also got something from the Pasadena Municipal Court.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right, it's supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm sorry. You sent more than one letter about that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It bothers me.</p>", "9170": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, that's right. Thursday is Stan Lee Day.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now you see what you've done? Because of you, we're all going to miss Stan Lee.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Whoa! What do you mean all?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, you're my friends. You'll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when I'm victorious.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, okay. No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thats what I'm saying.</p>", "9171": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Wow. Uh, Stan Lee, or you in court? Uh, if this was Sophie's Choice it would've been a much shorter movie. No.</p>", "9172": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, then, my so-called friends have forsaken me. So, I guess it'll just be me and my eyewitness.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, balls.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Please try to wear something appropriate. It won't help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word Juicy scrawled across your buttocks.</p>", "9173": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now, sit down. I call your attention to the events of November 16. Do you remember that date?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (reading the transcript Sheldon prepared) Darn tootin', I do, if the court will excuse my homespun, corn-fed Nebraskan turn of phrase.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excellent. Go on.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> The reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I've ever seen in, like, ever.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And who performed that heroic act?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's no need for compliments, this court is only interested in the facts.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> But it is a fact that it's a privilege to know you. Totally. A teardrop rolls down my cheek?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Only a suggestion. A catch in your throat would work just as well.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (feigning sadness) But it is a fact that it's a privilege to know you. Totally.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again.</p>", "9174": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal. But first, I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. I'm unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera. So, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete.</p>", "9175": "<p><strong>Judge:</strong> Impressive.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Judge:</strong> Guilty. Pay the cashier.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I object. You're completely ignoring the law.<br/><strong>Judge:</strong> No, I'm following the law. I'm ignoring you.</p>", "9176": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am a scientist. I never apologize for the truth.</p>", "9177": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> We're home.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, hey, buddy. How'd it go?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know very well how it went.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, but we all want to hear it from you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was found guilty and fined $533.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm going to write you a check for that. As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others.</p>", "9178": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I also now have three points on a driver's license I do not yet possess, and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because I refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Plus, you didn't get to meet Stan Lee.</p>", "9179": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, that's enough, Howard. The poor guy's had a tough time. He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You're right, so it would be cruel to mention that after he finished signing autographs, Stan Lee took Stuart and us out for gelato.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You had gelato with Stan Lee?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> He said we could call him Stan.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Except for Raj.</p>", "9180": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I hope you're satisfied, Penny. You are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, I realize that-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not finished. It is because of you that I now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that I missed out on having gelato with Stan Lee.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, maybe youll have another chance to have-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, no. I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime. The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!</br></p>", "9181": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, Stuart.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, hey, Penny. Wow. Hi.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What's going on?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Nothing. I'm just getting ready to close up and head out.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ah. Cool. Got any fun plans?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, yeah. Big night tonight. Gonna share a can of tuna with the cat.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, nice.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Not even my cat. I just feed it. Some nights it doesn't even show up.</p>", "9182": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is Stan Lee's front door. We were on Stan Lee's curb, then we were on Stan Lee's walk, and now we're at Stan Lee's front door.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yup.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Lord, you just rang Stan Lee's doorbell. At Stan Lee's house. We're about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, sweetie, I don't know if we're gonna have cookies, or he's just gonna say hi, or really what's gonna happen, so just let me talk...</p>", "9183": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I understand your point, but given a choice Jews always go with Chinese food.</p>", "9184": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine's Day.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, wow. Okay. Let's see. We've got milk chocolate, Swiss cheese, fondue.<br/>\nMy lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this, then I'm going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?</p>", "9185": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We're going to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider. And ski. We'll also go skiing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We're going skiing in Switzerland?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, you'll ski, I'll fall. But yeah, we will be in Switzerland for Valentine's Day.</p>", "9186": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You actually put that in an agreement?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He can't kill me, even if I turn.</p>", "9187": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> That's not true. My happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Although, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a little bit of a perk.</p>", "9188": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Who's miserable and alone?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener.</p>", "9189": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, you got a minute?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says aprs supercollider?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, I'm not taking you to Switzerland.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What? That's absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, but it'll be Valentine's Day. We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.</p>", "9190": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> But it does involve air travel. Okay, um, let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife, and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, I'm starting to think Swiss is key here.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh-huh.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We're going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How does that involve air travel?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We're going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn?</p>", "9191": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not so fast. You might want to hold off on lighting your Rbeliechtli, Penny.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> My Rabi-what-lee?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Rbeliechtli. It means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain Swiss festivals. Which you will not be celebrating because, a. these festivals occur in the fall, and b. you will not be going to Switzerland.</p>", "9192": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, that seemed a little far-fetched.</p>", "9193": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply don't care. I no longer stage spontaneous bio-hazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing.</p>", "9194": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, Sheldon, I know its in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you. In fact, Ill even let you eat my brains. But I am taking Penny to Switzerland.</p>", "9195": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, I know what'll cheer you up, let's play one of your driving games.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right. This game is called Traitors. I will name three historical figures, you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal. Benedict Arnold, Judas, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're right. Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.</br></p>", "9196": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Round two. Leonard Hofstadter, Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Rupert Murdoch?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He owns FOX and they canceled Firefly. Hint, he and Darth Vader are tied for number two.</p>", "9197": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm sorry I couldn't hang with you last night. I had a date with Bernadette.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I know. I saw the tweet.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So, what did you end up doing?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Not much. Nuked a burrito. Prayed to the Hindu god Urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.</p>", "9198": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've made you breakfast. Juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See, here's Frodo.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You made Frodo pancakes?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why are you doing this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. I've had some time to reflect and I've come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. It's a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. Butterscotch scone?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thanks. It's good.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What you're tasting is respect and affection. And about a pound of Crisco. After you've finished breakfast, I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You hate Babylon 5.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I do. It fails as drama, science fiction, and it's hopelessly derivative. But you like it, and you're my friend.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, great. Still not taking you to Switzerland.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Drat. No Frodo for you.</p>", "9199": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief PowerPoint presentation. Lights. \"Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD, should go to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider\", a PowerPoint presentation by Sheldon Cooper, PhD.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, for God's sake.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind's understanding of the universe, a.k.a. me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger, a.k.a. you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm sorry. Is this supposed to be buttering me up?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. It is a Mecca for physicists the world over. This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard. They sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. Now, let's see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, show's over.</p>", "9200": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know what? Even though I don't have a girlfriend, I can still have a good time on Valentine's Day.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Trust me, you can't. I've tried.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, no, no, I\u2019m going to have a me day. First I\u2019m going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown, take a steam and get a massage. Then I\u2019m going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies.</p>", "9201": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, I need to talk to you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, my friend. Would you like some cholermues?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Some what?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Cholermues. It's a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I'm preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're not going to Switzerland!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, but I am. Didn't Penny tell you the good news?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, that good news.</p>", "9202": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> With the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gates\u2019 house should I be invited.</p>", "9203": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just think, this time tomorrow we'll be in Geneva, Switzerland for our first Valentine's Day.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know! I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thermal? 'cause it's gonna be cold.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Think it through, Leonard.</p>", "9204": "<p>*Penny sneezes*<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Gesundheit. Or as they say in Switzerland, gesundheit. You getting a cold?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, no, it's probably just allergies.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you want an allergy pill? 'cause I have 'em all. Prescription, nonprescription, foreign, domestic, experimental.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Do any of them work?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not really. I'm just an enthusiast.</p>", "9205": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, my goodness, look at this room! Champagne! Roses! Oh and little chocolates! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, I forgot about all this.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> But I never will.</p>", "9206": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Great. It's not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You can come with us.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, it's okay. I don't have to go. I'm happy to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. I'm a walking, brown Yelp.com</p>", "9207": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, that's a crazy thing.</p>", "9208": "<p><strong>Employment adviser: </strong> So, Mr. Cooper, you're looking for a job?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A menial job. Like yours.<br/><strong>Employment adviser: </strong> Why thank you for noticing. I'm Menial Employee of the Month.</p>", "9209": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon took our order.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon doesn't work here.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn't either.</p>", "9210": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When does the C.S.I. team get here?\n<strong>Policeman:</strong> What?\n<strong>Sheldon:</strong> In anticipation of their arrival, I've bagged some evidence. One of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home. You should be able to pull some good prints off this. And now, here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect.\n<strong>Leonard:</strong> What about me?\n<strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, Leonard. It's too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job.\n</p>", "9211": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Would I be completely out of line to ask for you to shoot him?<br><strong>Police Officer:</strong> I'd be happy to put him under a 72-hour psychiatric hold.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not crazy. My mother had me tested.<br/></br></p>", "9212": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I can't believe it. if I hadn't been working the dinner shift, I would've run right into the robbers.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, there's no reason for you to be scared.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm not scared. I would've gone all Nebraska on their asses.</p>", "9213": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'll send them a basket of muffins.</p>", "9214": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> is he quitting his job at the university?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh no, he's going to telecommute. Everybody's really excited about it.</p>", "9215": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In the meantime, please forward my mail.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Any place specific or just the Bozeman, Montana Loony Bin?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I sense you're making a joke, but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin, so do not forward my mail there.</p>", "9216": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm going to be a Bozite.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> They call themselves Bozites?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They should. It's one of the first thing I plan to bring up upon arrival.</p>", "9217": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Boy, seems like forever since the four of us have been out to eat, you know? Just the guys.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, God. Yes, we get it. You have a girlfriend now.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> A little jealous, are we?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, I'm not jealous. All right, I'd kill a hobo if it'll get me laid. Now, can we order?</p>", "9218": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, dear Lord, they re-did the menu.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So what? It's the same food.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, is it? Look at this. General Tso's Chicken is no longer listed under specialties. It's now under chicken.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, General Tso.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Not Tso the chicken, so the question. So?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, why is it no longer a specialty? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself?</p>", "9219": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know what? Let's just get a pizza.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good idea. We'll go to Corleone's.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sure, no mobsters there.</p>", "9220": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (To a policeman) They took our TV, two laptops, four external hard-drives, our PS2, our PS3, our X-Box, our X-Box 360, our classic Nintendo, our Super Nintendo, our Nintendo 64 and our Wii.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We like games.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Right, games. They took Halo 1, Halo 2, Halo 3, Call of Duty 1, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3, Rock Band, Rock Band 2, Final Fantasy 1 thru 9, The Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Galaxy, Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics and Ms. Pacman.<br/><strong>Policeman:</strong> (Writing down) Assorted video games.</p>", "9221": "<p>Policeman: We're done here. Call this number, and w'll fax you a copy of the report so you can submit it to your insurance company.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, that's the end of your inquiry?<br/>\nPoliceman: Do you have any more information that might be relevant?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance, my laptop contained four out of the five Gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How is that going to help them?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop.</p>", "9222": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are we supposed to do now?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The only thing we can do. Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Does that mean you've ruled me out as a suspect?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, how I wish I could.</p>", "9223": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, as small as Leonard is, I don't think the two of youd be comfortable on the couch.</p>", "9224": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you want?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's not what I want, it's what evolution wants. Human beings are primates. Primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> But you don't like other people.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I do tonight. It's scary over there.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's getting scary here, too.</p>", "9225": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Umm. Three little kittens? Three little pigs? God, I don't know. Star Wars?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did we win? Can we go to bed?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good Lord, I could not have made this easier. Hydrogen atom, H. Plus, pigs minus pea, Higgs. Bow, General Zod trapped in the Phantom Zone. Bow-zone. Pear. Tickle. Pear-tickle. Higgs Boson Particle. How could you not get that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He's right, Penny. It's all there.</br></p>", "9226": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Look, Sheldon, sweetie, I know you're feeling insecure, but we've really got to go to sleep.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right. I'll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Great. Good night.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, wait, what's 0400?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> 4 am.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's, like, in 45 minutes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just keep walking.</p>", "9227": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Now, inside, we've got motion detectors, infrared sensors, and cameras connected to a server running state-of-the-art facial recognition software.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where did you get all this stuff?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I got a buddy over at the Department of Defense.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He just gave it to you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm sure he would have if I had asked. Ironically, their security isn't all that good.</p>", "9228": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wonderful security system if we're attacked by a school of tuna.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't worry, the net's going to be electrified. Picture her on the floor, spasming uncontrollably.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Better.</p>", "9229": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> God, Sheldon. What the hell are you doing out there?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I heard a noise.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It was us. We knocked over a lamp.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why would you knock over a lamp?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We were going to have...<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> He doesn't need to know what we were doing, Leonard.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh! No, she's right, I don't need to know what you were doing. Carry on.</p>", "9230": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Our apartment was broken into, our security system tried to kill me, and as a result, I'm leaving Pasadena forever. Tell me how that's overreacting.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on, Sheldon, you can't move. Don't you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, if that were only true. Unfortunately, as I'm earthbound for the foreseeable future, I need to find a location that's more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena.</p>", "9231": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Like Enid, Oklahoma. Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity, but no model train shops. Sorry, Enid.</p>", "9232": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, Boone, North Carolina. Every summer since 1952, Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, Dan\u2019l Boone. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd.</p>", "9233": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, come on. So you were the victim of a crime. That's part of life. When my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York. You know what happened? Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. But, those people moved on, and so should you.</p>", "9234": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, look who's back!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Interesting. The acquaintance is the first to greet me.</p>", "9235": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> They get girlfriends and they just abandon us?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It is great, isn't it? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us.</p>", "9236": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Come on, Sheldon, the world is filled with people doing things outside. Let's go outside. Outside is good.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?</p>", "9237": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I would like a root beer float.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon, they don't have ice cream.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They don't? Well, apparently these people and I differ greatly on the definition of party.</p>", "9238": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> He'll have a Shirley Temple.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And don't be chintzy with the Shirley.</p>", "9239": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sorry, but facts are facts.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Right, and if you can't understand it, it's not a fact.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, if it's not a fact, it's not a fact.</p>", "9240": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't like to kiss and tell, but somebody made it to eighth base.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> What the hell is eighth base?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Seventh base with shirt off. Well, my shirt.</br></p>", "9241": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Let me show you another way to look at this. Here we have the universe of all women. These are the ones you want to sleep with. These are the women who believe exactly what you believe. These are the women who would be willing to sleep with you. And right there in the little triple intersection is your ideal mate. Odds are she's a short physicist with low self-esteem who lives in a government research facility in China.</p>", "9242": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, that's all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included Howard Wolowitz?</p>", "9243": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look at us. Getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they're our girlfriends.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes, actual women are the best.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't understand. What other kind of women are there?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Howard, artificial women are your department. You want to take this?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, it would just freak him out.</p>", "9244": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Listen, before we leave, I should warn you, I'm a passionate man and I tend towards public displays of affection.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you trying to tell me, Howard?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> There might be some making out in the car or the restaurant, and I don't want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable, so it would help if you and Penny made out, too.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't worry. We're planning to have sex right on the salad bar.</p>", "9245": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Namaste, white people. Good news! I rented us the four-hour edition of Watchmen.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Got it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Seen it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Detailed analysis posted online.</p>", "9246": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What about me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I understand there are several types of artificial women. Maybe you should look into that.</p>", "9247": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Dude, there's so many cool things we could be doing tonight. Look. At the Glendale Galleria, \"Put on your best zoot suit, it's a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macy's. 5pm to 9pm\", huh, huh? A salute to zoot. Sounds like a hoot.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that's linked to race riots in the 1940s.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Race riots?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The zoot suit riots.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale.</p>", "9248": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, then why don't we just go to the Galleria and walk around?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No. We would just walk around and see what's what.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's a semantically null sentence.</p>", "9249": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, well, how about this? From the university Web site, 7pm to 10pm, Norton Hall Multipurpose Room, mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, that's certainly amusing, but I have no interest.</p>", "9250": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Please, Sheldon, I'm a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let me offer you a compromise. Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery, I use my imagination.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, boy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> One of my favorite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott's mathematical fantasy, Flatland.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't want to go to Flatland.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're only saying that because you haven't been there. I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is that you, Raj? I don't recognize your edge.</p>", "9251": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon, I'm begging you. I want to go to this mixer, and I don't want to go alone.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, you're in luck. There's a mixer here in Flatland. Oh, look, there's a sexually attractive line segment, you should chat her up.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Tell her you're a circle. Flatland gals are all hot for circles.</p>", "9252": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I hope you're hungry, Bernadette. We're going to a terrific restaurant.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, yeah, I'm starved. When you spend all day in a bio-lab, watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents it really works up an appetite.</p>", "9253": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Flesh-eating bacteria. And yet, I still want to kiss this woman, what does that tell you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That you'd be willing to die a horrible death on the off-chance you'd get to second base?</p>", "9254": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> How's your work going, Penny? Any acting jobs?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, the last big thing I did was this production of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. But I think things might be turning around pretty soon.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Great. How come?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, promise you won't make fun of me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Of course, I would never make fun of you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay. Well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair, I'm going to get a national commercial.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (Laughing) Seriously? You're getting career advice from a psychic?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Good job not making fun of her.</p>", "9255": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> She's not one of those phonies, okay. She wrote a book and has her own Web site.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, gee, why didn't you say so? They don't let just anyone have a Web site.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why are you being such a jerk?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're surprised? Your psychic didn't tell you I was going to be a jerk?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ha-ha, bite me.</br></p>", "9256": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Thanks for coming with me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thanks for giving me your limited edition Green Lantern lantern.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Did you really have to bring it in with you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?</p>", "9257": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Come on, let's get a drink.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't drink.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, well I do. And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot. I'll have a screwdriver, please. Don't be chintzy with the screw.</p>", "9258": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, let's check out the females.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right. There's a female.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's Professor Wilkinson's wife. She's like 80 years old.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But she's female. Isn't that the game?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No. I'm looking for a hookup.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Not so loud, but ideally, yes. Thanks.</p>", "9259": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you. And what is my function as wingman?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You help me run my game.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. What is your game?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree.</p>", "9260": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So, what should we talk about?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots. Leonard?</p>", "9261": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Thank you for educating me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're welcome. How's your fish?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Amazing. Would you like to try some?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, sure.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, the fact is, you can't.</p>", "9262": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, Howard, Bernadette, you're both scientists. Help me out here.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What do you think? Want to jump right into the middle of another couple's argument?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> No, thank you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sorry.</p>", "9263": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe we should just stop talking about this.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.<br/>\nWaiter: How is everything tonight?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Really uncomfortable.</p>", "9264": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent Cylons?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not just Cylons. Superman's next.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, I was going to try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch, but I can come back later when you don't have a high-powered weapon.</p>", "9265": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The dog - koira. The roof - katto. Grapes - viinirypleet. One minute. Sisn!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What was that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It means come in. It's taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now I thought I'd learn Finnish.</p>", "9266": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> \u091c\u0939\u093e\u0902 \u0906\u092a\u0915\u0940 \u092e\u0930\u094d\u091c\u0940 \u0939\u094b. That's Hindi for whatever floats your boat.</p>", "9267": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, listen, I got a text from that girl Abby, and she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again. What do you say?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't say anything. I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you've gone insane.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't get it. You had a great time.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, exactly, I had a great time. That's done. I've moved on to other things. For example, after I learn Finnish, I'm not going to learn Finnish again.</p>", "9268": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Please, Sheldon, I'm a lost Indian boy far from home, and I want a girlfriend and I want her to be Abby, and she'll only come over if she can bring Martha.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Raj, I highly doubt there is any argument you can make, threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation, supplication, or \"vetoomus\" that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, my. I've admired these for years.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> So does that mean we can go with the girls again?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!</p>", "9269": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey. Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh? Not only is it courteous, it's safety smart. Every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. Now you're supposed to say, wow, what an interesting fact. Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy. I could never be mad at you.</p>", "9270": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I'm sorry. I really am. It's not right to mock what a person believes in.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Thank you. Would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it's all about?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I would not.</br></p>", "9271": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oh, did I thank you for the flowers?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You did.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I don't really like flowers.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Me neither, but it's the social convention.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> It is, isn't it?</p>", "9272": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I heard that.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Then what was all that \"wait, wait, wait\" about?</p>", "9273": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> One day, I hold a great ball for the President of France, but the rabbits, they hate me and don't come. I'm embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce in the world and make them watch.</p>", "9274": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, five. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, wow, look at that, my Department of Defense research grant is renewed.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yay.</p>", "9275": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't want to play a game, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's called Scientists. Now, I will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay, ready to have some fun?</p>", "9276": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard! Stop the car!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't listen to the two of you fight anymore.</p>", "9277": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Come on, come on, we're late.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Calm down, we'll make the movie.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we'll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and pre-show urination.</p>", "9278": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey. We're, uh, going to the movies.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, we're not. We're standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hang on. They're showing a new digital print of Time Bandits, you wouldn't want to come, would you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Not really, no.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, invitation pointlessly offered, invitation declined as expected, everyone's civil, nobody's fighting. Have a nice evening.</p>", "9279": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You mean like when a guy's upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn't show up because he's doing a juice fast with his mother?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I didn't know you were upset about that.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, \"Howard, I am upset\".<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, sorry.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Maybe it means something different in this country. Back in India, it means you're upset with a guy named Howard!</p>", "9280": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, thank you very much. Come back soon. With the other half of my tip.</p>", "9281": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, fine, it's soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course not. I'll have my usual.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Great.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aren't you going to ask me if I want a beverage?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Don't you usually get lemonade?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Do you want lemonade?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.</p>", "9282": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I am not going to apologize. I've done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn't about you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't follow.</p>", "9283": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you, you're making a little check sign in the air, I got it, just hold your horses. What does Leonard complain about?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> My singing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn't agree with it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn't he just said so?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because, according to him, you're oversensitive and have a temper.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, really? Well, then, do me a favor and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And she wonders why she's constantly under-tipped.</p>", "9284": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, good, you're home. I need you to do me a favor.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Go apologize to Penny.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Right now would be good.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (knocking) Leonard!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Although, a few minutes ago would have been better.</p>", "9285": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong>  Sheldon! (whistles)<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you doing? He's not a lost dog.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, why don't you just let me find him while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn't.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What stop sign?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!</br></p>", "9286": "<p>Mrs. <strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Howard, answer the door! I'm busy!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm busy too. You answer it.<br/>\nMrs. <strong>Wolowitz:</strong> I can't! I'm on the toilet!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> For God's sake, I don't need to hear that! Can't you just say, \"I'm busy\"?<br/>\nMrs. <strong>Wolowitz:</strong> I said I'm busy, but that wasn't good enough for you!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know what? I hope it's one of those home invasion deals, and they shoot me in the head.<br/>\nMrs. <strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Well, if it's a home invader, don't tell them I'm on the toilet!</p>", "9287": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm not leaving until you talk to me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, what's going on?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he's in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we're in, but he can't perceive us.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't flatter yourself. I'm just ignoring you.</p>", "9288": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on, Sheldon, let's go home. Look, we're done fighting.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've heard that before, but then, the next thing you know I'm hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad's meatloaf, and my dad's on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, there's going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting.</p>", "9289": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, how about we buy you this robot, and then we all go home?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I want that one.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, you can have that one.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, come on, he's just going to play with it twice, and then it'll end up in his closet with all the other junk.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Buy him the robot, Leonard.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can I get this comic book, too?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes, you can.</p>", "9290": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who you're now platonic with but still might have a thing for your friend?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, he's definitely not gay.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend's couch. Yippee!</p>", "9291": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh and FYI, you never even heard of The Black Eyed Peas until you met me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'd heard of them. Didn't know they were a band.</p>", "9292": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, there it is again. You think I'm stupid.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, there's a difference between being stupid and acting stupid.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, yeah? Well, there's a difference between being a jerk and being an ass.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, there isn't. They're synonyms.</p>", "9293": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't care! And why don't you think I can find a woman for myself?<br/><strong>Mrs. <strong>Koothrappali:</strong></strong> Because you're twenty-seven, and the closest thing we have to a daughter-in-law is that Jewish boy Howard.</p>", "9294": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, guys. What you doing? Going out to discover electricity?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you're referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. Kites, ho.</p>", "9295": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, I've got some friends coming over. Not a big thing, we're just gonna watch the Nebraska game.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh. Football, sure.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Good guess.</p>", "9296": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, this sucks.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, I got bored and drifted off. Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Leonard just realized that Penny's been hiding him from her friends because he's a tiny, little man who flies kites.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that certainly would suck.</p>", "9297": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, Penny doesn't want me around her friends. I embarrass her. What else could it be?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she's excluded you from these gatherings because she's scouting for a new mate and doesn't want to do it in front of you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, how kind of her.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Agreed. Most primates don't show that sort of discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do.</p>", "9298": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, my god, no. Why would you ask that?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, you know, I just noticed I haven't really met any of them.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sure you have.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller, yet still larger than me, ex-boyfriend.</p>", "9299": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard, look, if you want to meet my friends, that would be great. I just, you know, I didn't want you to be bored.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I wouldn't be bored. Why would I be bored?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, 'cause they're not genius scientists.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my best friends aren't geniuses.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Like who?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren't geniuses.</p>", "9300": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong>  Well, then why don't you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Another football game?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> They have them every week.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did not know that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure, sure, just I don't know much about football.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that's okay. A lot of the guys' girlfriends don't know football. They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Great.</br></p>", "9301": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> All I know about Saks is, my mother shops there.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (Thumbing through a guide book) Sacks, sacks<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Huh. (Searching the book again) Scrimmage<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offense from the defense.</p>", "9302": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you're interested, I also know all about frying meat that isn't chicken as if it were chicken.</p>", "9303": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Please, I'm asking you as a friend.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you making this a tier one friendship request?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine.</p>", "9304": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sorry?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's how my father always began our football conversations. And if you'd like, after the game, I'll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a raccoon that it craps itself.</p>", "9305": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica.</p>", "9306": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is that what you're wearing to watch football at Penny's?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's wrong with a football jersey?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress.</p>", "9307": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, no, I'm trying to fit in, not get laughed at.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's funny about Cylon toast?</p>", "9308": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I brought you a little gift. New kite.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang, an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is Hello Kitty.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. Does a Patang?</p>", "9309": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Go! Go! Go! Go, go, go, go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sweetie, that's a highlight from the '98 championship game.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh. Did not know that.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> How much beer have you had?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> None. Why?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now we're back live.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, yeah. I can see the difference.</p>", "9310": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, come in.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you. I'd like to make a sandwich, but I'm out of bread.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> There's some in the fridge.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You shouldn't keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> On Earth, we say thank you.</p>", "9311": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Mimesis?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What the hell are you talking about?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.</p>", "9312": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Kite fighting?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, yeah. It's an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-present danger.</p>", "9313": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe Koothrappali's right. Maybe I embarrass her.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're embarrassing me right now. A grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites.</p>", "9314": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I would have caught up to her if I hadn't pulled a hammy.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds. You don't have a hammy.</p>", "9315": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> We won.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, that's excellent. It's a weird figure of speech, isn't it? We won, when you weren't actually playing. When we watch Star Wars, we don't say we defeated the empire.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm glad to hear it.</br></p>", "9316": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help.</p>", "9317": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's exactly what my father said. Come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life.</p>", "9318": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Then I'll just cut your vines with my Ruby Sword. (Playing card, making gesture to Howard) That's right, I did it, I cut them.</p>", "9319": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This movie baffles me every time we watch it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you mean?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, the instructions are very clear. Don't feed the gremlins after midnight. Don't get the gremlins wet. How hard is that?</p>", "9320": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, what are you guys doing?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Celebrating Columbus Day.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We're watching Goonies, Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes. ... They were all written by Chris Columbus.</p>", "9321": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, you know, that reminds me. I usually go back to Nebraska for Thanksgiving, but this year they're calling it off on account of my brother's trial.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's he on trial for?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, just a big misunderstanding. You know, you'd actually like my brother. He's kind of a chemist.</p>", "9322": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Tur-briska-fil?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. It's not as good as it sounds.</p>", "9323": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, what's going on with Raj?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother's tur-brka-fil.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hard to believe, but go on.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The bad news is, he says he's getting deported.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What do you mean, he's getting deported?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that's willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally, I'd choose pirate.</p>", "9324": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ugh, fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today, I understand that's an all-male profession.</p>", "9325": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, she's gone.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sorry. I lost my cool.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, what's going on?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, here's the deal .Six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> So, my visa's only good as long as I'm employed at the university. And when they find out I've got squat, theyre going to cut me off. By the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat.</p>", "9326": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And you've continued to take the university's money under false pretenses? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate.</p>", "9327": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, guys, think, how do we keep Raj in the country?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (from outside) Why doesnt he just get another job?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (Raj whispers to Howard) What are you asking me for? I don't know if you can talk now or not.</p>", "9328": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, beef, Im going to miss you so much. Do you know, at the Mumbai McDonald's, you can't get a Big Mac? All you can get is a Chicken Maharaja Mac. And the special sauce is curry, which in India, believe you me, is really not that special.</p>", "9329": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Don't worry. You'll find another job.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, let me start practicing for it. \"Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?\"</p>", "9330": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> Hello Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Forgive me .As you know, I'm not adept at reading facial cues, but I'm going to take a stab here, you're either sad or nauseated.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm sad.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was going to say sad. I don't know why I hedged.</br></p>", "9331": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What are you eating?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, beefaroni. I think I'll miss you most of all.</p>", "9332": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Me, too. I'm just, I'm a little on edge.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Understandable. Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And you're wrong about Hinduism and cows.</p>", "9333": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, Raj, guess what. Professor Laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution research team.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You-you're kidding. That's fantastic!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Come on, what are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm on it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's happy, right?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nailed it.</p>", "9334": "<p><strong>Professor Laughlin:</strong> Dr. Koothrappali, come on in. I was surprised to hear you were interested In joining our little team. Giving up on those trans-Neptunian objects, are we?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, no, it's a very promising area. In a perfect world I'd spend several more years on it. But I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.</p>", "9335": "<p><strong>Professor Laughlin:</strong> Splendid. Uh, please sit down. Can I offer you a sherry?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's a little early, isn't it?<br/><strong>Professor Laughlin:</strong> Not on Proxima Centauri.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That's very good. Jolly amusing, but if you don't mind, I'll hold off until sunset on titan.<br/><strong>Professor Laughlin:</strong> Oh, well done. I have a feeling you're going to fit in just fine, Dr. Koothrappali.</p>", "9336": "<p><strong>Professor Laughlin:</strong> Dr. Koothrappali, may I present Dr. Millstone from MIT. She'll be heading up our data analysis team.<br/><strong>Dr. Millstone:</strong> It's nice to meet you, Dr. Koothrappali. I read your paper on Kuiper belt object size distribution. I really enjoyed it. How did you correct for the selection bias?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (After drinking a large sherry) Well, I ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency.<br/><strong>Dr. Millstone:</strong> That's just fascinating.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you. Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? ... So, when do I start?</p>", "9337": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm really going to miss you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Will you come visit me in India?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Gee, that's, like, a 17-hour flight. How about I meet you halfway?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Tell you what, we'll Skype.</p>", "9338": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Anyway, I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that I could benefit-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Excuse me, Sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry. If you didn't cheer at my entrance, it's too late to buy into the premise. Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and Raj can come work for me.</p>", "9339": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I've reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For me.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes, for you. I do, however, have a few conditions. First, at all times, I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second, my contributions shall be noted in all published material. And third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm impressed, Raj. Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I reject them all.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.</p>", "9340": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, I believe you've misunderstood. I'm not giving you the job. I'm simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, we'll get started with the interview.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Wha... you're kidding!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Please.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> All right.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, that's what you wear to an interview?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Come on, dude, we've been friends for years.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, pulling strings, are we?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon, for God's sakes, don't make me beg.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Bazinga! You've fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I'm your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.</p>", "9341": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Ah, it's nice having the place to ourselves, isn't it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I don't have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mm-hmm. Hey, want to get a little crazy?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you thinking?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Let's slide over to Sheldon's spot a make out.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You are a dirty girl.</p>", "9342": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while. So what are we watching? Sex and the City. Yikes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, I happen to love this movie.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine, let's watch it. Maybe all our periods will synchronize.</p>", "9343": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you doing here?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but he's still working with Sheldon, so I thought I'd come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. It's the perfect meal for apres l'amour.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, kill me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> By the way, I couldn't help overhearing your big finish. Bravo, Leonard.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> See, if you had killed me when I said kill me, I wouldn't have had to hear that.</p>", "9344": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> No, no, no, no! That rate is much too low for what we'd expect from this collision. Do you understand that we're talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm the astrophysicist. Astro means space.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Astro means star.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, I'd be kicking your butt.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> English is your native language.</p>", "9345": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> My god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well, let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Caca?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It means doo-doo.</br></p>", "9346": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait, you have to drive me home.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How did you get here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I walked.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> So walk home.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can't. There's a big dog outside.</p>", "9347": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> All right, want some French toast?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's Oatmeal Day.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Tell you what, next French Toast Day, I will make you oatmeal.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?</p>", "9348": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sorry. I haven't given her your schedule yet.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's an iCal download, she can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that you'd have your conjugal visits in her apartment.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We did, but there were extenuating circumstances.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?</p>", "9349": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, her bed kind of ... broke.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That doesn't seem likely. Her bed's of sturdy construction. Even the addition<br/>\nof a second normal size human being wouldn't cause a structural failure, much less a homunculus such as yourself.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> A homunculus?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Perfectly formed miniature human being.</p>", "9350": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, so Kim, the night manager, went on maternity leave, and her husband's name is Sandy, right? So get this, her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband's name is Kim.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wow!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know. What are the odds?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Easily calculable. We begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work: the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. Next we look at-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon! It's an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry. Ooh, Penny, it's as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches.</p>", "9351": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What was that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It does. But in my experience, you don't.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, now that's you, obnoxious and insufferable.</p>", "9352": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I think we're fitting in quite nicely.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It'd help if you weren't drinking light beer.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, what's so Gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hello, it looks like blood. Did you even read the wikiHow link I sent you on being goth?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, I'm behind on my wiki reading. I'm kind of on a John Grisham kick right now.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I finished reading The Pelican Brief and loved it so much, I dived right into The Client. He was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining.</p>", "9353": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Light beers? Well, wikiHow about that?</p>", "9354": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?</p>", "9355": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There's just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard? You weren't happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner. By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, this has to stop now.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the Bazinga! was implied.</p>", "9356": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, you're not sanding Penny.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you saying that I'm forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, you're forbidden.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Squirts Leonard with a water spray) Bad Leonard!</p>", "9357": "<p><strong>Bethany:</strong> So what do you guys do?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, you know, goth stuff. Goth magazines, goth music.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Goth food.<br/><strong>Sarah:</strong> What's goth food?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh ... blackened salmon?</p>", "9358": "<p><strong>Bethany:</strong> No, I meant what do you do for jobs?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, we're scientists.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.<br/><strong>Bethany:</strong> What are the dark sciences?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, I am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night. When there are vampires and miscellaneous un-dead out and about.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oy vey.</p>", "9359": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What could she possibly be talking about for so long?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Obviously, waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity, that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. Bazinga!</p>", "9360": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, using positive reinforcement techniques, I could train that behavior out of her in a week.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're not squirting her in the face with water.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, of course not. Were talking very mild electric shocks. No tissue damage whatsoever.</br></p>", "9361": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, come on, you can't tell me that you're not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm not. And Penny's qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/>\nSheldon You wouldn't prefer a throaty chuckle?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're not changing how Penny laughs.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, that would be incongruous, I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register.</p>", "9362": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Uh, yeah!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What is your mother going to say?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She's not going to see it. She takes my temperature orally now.</p>", "9363": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I'm going to make some warm milk and then turn in. I trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activities, you'll keep the decibel level to a minimum.</p>", "9364": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> All right, Sheldon, here we go, Kleingast's Field Guide to North American Insects. Hey, Toby. Right here, see it? The common field cricket, aka Gryllus assimilis, which is Latin for suck it, you lose.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hang on. Voil\u00e0, the snowy tree cricket, aka Oecanthus fultoni, which is Latin for I'll suck nothing. Of course I'm joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo.</p>", "9365": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'm not feeling so hot either.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why would that make me feel better?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't know, empathy?</p>", "9366": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends, whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley's chicken.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What's Mrs. Riley's chicken?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, forget the chicken.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I wish I could.</p>", "9367": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You may be right about me and Leonard.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course I'm right What are the odds I'd be wrong twice in one week?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I just said that. This conversation has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.</p>", "9368": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey. What's going on?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, you'd like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz.</p>", "9369": "<p><strong>Crawley:</strong> I've been studying insects since I was 8 years old. You know what they use to call me in school? Creepy Crawley!</p>", "9370": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Nothing flamed out. We don't have to have sex every night, you know.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You don't have to, but it's highly recommended.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky.</p>", "9371": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not a matter of opportunity. We're getting to know each other. There's a learning curve.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What's there to learn? You get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. Easy peasy.</p>", "9372": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ.</p>", "9373": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, dinner's here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Tandoori Palace?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, we went somewhere new.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You\u2019re good-naturedly ribbing me, aren't you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, look, Mumbai Palace.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.</p>", "9374": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Trust me, this will be just fine.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You are the authority on just fine.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's that supposed to mean?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (after Raj whispers to him) Yeah, exactly. Not bad, but not great.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What are they talking about?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know. As I'm sure you're aware...<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If that's Morse code, that's terrible.</p>", "9375": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as just fine. So what you're seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay. Yeah, well, I'm just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere. Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside.</br></p>", "9376": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What did you tell them?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Nothing bad, just that last night was fine.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Fine? You said it was fine?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, it's a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining, and you've really got something.</p>", "9377": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> It was ... okay.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, it's a perfectly good word. I mean, you put it in front of dokay and you really got something.</p>", "9378": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What's that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sounds like a cricket.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hang on. Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, give me a frickin' break. How could you possibly know that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard, I've had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of '06.</p>", "9379": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, you were right about Wolverine and bone claws, but you're wrong about the cricket.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard, don't embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. Humorous word play.</p>", "9380": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> No, no, not this time. I know insects, my friend, I spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them, mounting them on corrugated cardboard with Dymo labels underneath, identifying the genus and species. In Latin.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess.</p>", "9381": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What was that?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> My stomach. Indian food doesn't agree with me. Ironic, isn't it?</p>", "9382": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't push me, Sheldon. I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13, and I remember a good deal of it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, really? Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?</p>", "9383": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Be careful.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If I were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful.</p>", "9384": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Hey, Cooper. Read your retraction email. Way to destroy your reputation! </p>", "9385": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. In fact, he was quite enthusiastic. He said, \"Frankly, if I could send you tonight, I would.\"</p>", "9386": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not good with cold, Leonard. How often have we had to leave a movie theater because I got a headache from drinking the Icee too fast? I can't go.</p>", "9387": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Odd, President Siebert posed the exact same question.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How was it resolved?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It wasn't. His wife set the dogs on me, and rendered the question moot.</p>", "9388": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I need access to the Cheesecake Factory's walk-in freezer.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Now, honey, I already told you, the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature.</p>", "9389": "<p><strong>Mrs. <strong>Koothrappali:</strong></strong> So, she has no problem with her son being eaten by a walrus?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali. If Raj dies, it'll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a hundred pound polar bear.</p>", "9390": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What about the really long hug? What did that mean?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> That wasn't a long hug.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It was at least five Mississippis. A standard hug is two Mississippis tops.</br></p>", "9391": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> But mummy, all the other guys are going to the North Pole.<br/><strong>Mrs. Koothrappali:</strong> I don't care what the other guys are doing. If the other guys jumped in the Bay of Bengal and tried to swim to Sri Lanka, would you follow them?</p>", "9392": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Dr. and Mrs. Koothrappali, namaste. I understand your concern, but if it'll make you feel any better, my mother is fine with me going. And this is a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until I was 17.<br/>\nMrs <strong>Koothrappali:</strong> So, she has no problem with her son being eaten by a walrus?</p>", "9393": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Smell that? That's the smell of new comic books. Oh, yes!<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> They're on me today, boys.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You're paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?</p>", "9394": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Uh, hey, Leonard, can I talk to you about something?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, sure, what's up?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Remember I went out with your friend Penny a couple weeks ago?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, vaguely.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sure you remember. You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.</p>", "9395": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> About Stuart? Love to.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> He's very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, uh, first of all, don't underestimate the value of discomfort.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that's why he works in a comic book store.</p>", "9396": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh. It's Stuart.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're not going to answer it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> He wants to talk about Penny. I don't want to talk about Penny.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why would he call me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We don't know. And if you don't answer the phone, we can't know.</p>", "9397": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Answer the phone, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No! There, it went to voice mail.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Aren't you going to check your messages?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy.</p>", "9398": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How teeny tiny?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's gonna fail after about ten flushes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But the mission is for six months.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, see, that's the code red. It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.</p>", "9399": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Have you notified NASA?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No. Are you crazy? What am I gonna say? I screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there's gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station?</p>", "9400": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, what are you gonna do?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm gonna figure out how to fix it, then I'll tell them.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, what do you need us for?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> He can't figure out how to fix it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I agree. It's the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.</p>", "9401": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey Stuart.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> You busy?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Um\u2026<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Classified, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, it's a regular Manhattan Project.</p>", "9402": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, tonight's my date with Penny and since we haven't been able to connect by phone...<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, I'm sorry, it's been broken.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Or e-mail.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, that too. Everything's broken.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, don't make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, you know, fear.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Fear?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, like, you're afraid that if you touch her, she'll break.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.</p>", "9403": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It won't work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What if we reposition the collection tank?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It won't work. No way to mount it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, here's an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That could work.</p>", "9404": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Morning. What\u2019s up?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity ... pasta maker.</p>", "9405": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin' latte.</p>", "9406": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hang on, I think I've got this. Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you're building.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn't be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.</br></p>", "9407": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Howard, wait. Why don't you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Because this is not a spare part from the space station. This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That what that's for? In India, the lid just touches the cheese. Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.</p>", "9408": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Sure, what's up?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I think I gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> No, your advice was great.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It was?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Yeah, going slow really worked.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're kidding. Never worked for me.</p>", "9409": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> Yeah, last night at dinner, I did what you told me, I went really slow, I kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wine? I didn't say to give her wine.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> It doesn't matter, that's where it all went to hell.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> No, everything was good and really hot, and I said \u201cOh, Penny,\u201d and right where she was supposed to say, \u201cOh, Stuart,\u201d she said ... your name.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Leonard?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> That is your name, right?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, no, yeah, wow, I'm sorry. That must've been the last thing you wanted to hear.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Well, it beats \"You know I'm a dude, right?\" Yeah, it was pretty bad.</p>", "9410": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> (talking on the phone) Yes, sir, I understand classified. We'll keep it all classified, no one has to know but you and me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What's classified?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Howard's space toilet. I'll tell you later.</p>", "9411": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sorry, were you talking to me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I said Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, you did, didn't you?</p>", "9412": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> What the hell is that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Meatloaf.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What was it doing on the ceiling?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's classified.</p>", "9413": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just think. Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>", "9414": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Is that supposed to be funny?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.</p>", "9415": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? 'cause you know, you and me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, no that's the past. I'm really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, 'case, well, that's my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn't bother me.</p>", "9416": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> It must be hell inside your head.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> At times.</p>", "9417": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Guys, we have a code red.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you mean code red for the hospital emergency alert, code red the computer worm, or Code Red the cherry-flavored soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?</p>", "9418": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the center cross-support?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No good. I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they've got up there? The thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.</p>", "9419": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma, dude.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You don't really believe in that superstition, do you?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's not superstition. It's practically Newtonian. For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch. Therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. It's actually a very elegant system. You know, what goes around comes around.</p>", "9420": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master's degree.</p>", "9421": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, are you from Star Wars universe?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Were you in the original trilogy?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> God, I hope not. And no, I'm not Princess Leia.</br></p>", "9422": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with, but you were free to date whoever you wanted.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, I can't imagine any of that.</p>", "9423": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Alright, back to the game.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe it's my turn, you may begin your questions whenever you're ready.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Are you Spock?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't like this game.</p>", "9424": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What happened with Leslie, why did she dump you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. She just said Howard, momma's a rolling stone. And then her call waiting beeped and she was gone.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't understand. If you were in a non-emotional relationship then why are you having what appears be an emotional response?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Of course I had feelings for her, I saw her naked for God's sake!</p>", "9425": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Howard, could I borrow some after shave?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Black case, top compartment.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That is a lot of cologne.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> First row are your musks, second is wood, leathers and botanicals, third is assorted pheromones, tread lightly.</p>", "9426": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, uh, if I get lucky I'll take her to my stately manor outside Gotham City, and if you get lucky, I'll sleep on the moon.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sounds like a plan.</p>", "9427": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hang on, I think the emergency key is around here somewhere.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We have a bowl. Our keys go in a bowl. You should get a bowl.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So, how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper forget his key in the first place.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I left them in the bowl.</p>", "9428": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Alright, Sheldon, let's just calm down and we'll call the building manager, he'll come open your door, you just eat your dinner here while you're waiting.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Eat? My dinner? In your apartment?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, why not?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sure, why not? And after the sun's down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek. 'cause today's the day to stop making sense.</p>", "9429": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> What's wrong with you dude, that woman was all up in my jammy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, I hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is, but, I'm pretty sure she is a prostitute.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What? No.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, let me put it this way, in your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Maybe I can save her.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe, but I'm guessing it will cost you about $500 an hour to try.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It was lovely meeting you, best of luck in your future endeavors.</p>", "9430": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, how was your day?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you trying to make small talk? Oh, sweetie, you really don't have to.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, it's the accepted convention. How was your day?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant so my hours are going to be a little different...<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, that's not going to interest me at all, just eat.</p>", "9431": "<p><strong>Mikayla:</strong> You want the girlfriend experience.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, actually, if it's not too much to ask, could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience.</p>", "9432": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, that's question 20, you have to guess.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, God, I don't know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How can one person be a whole movie?</p>", "9433": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was Spock. Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Where did that even come from, did he say we were?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, Leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was mis-delivered.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, just mail, no benefits.</p>", "9434": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sing Soft Kitty.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's only for when you're sick.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Homesick is a type of being sick.</p>", "9435": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, apparently the news didn't reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday.</br></p>", "9436": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we're going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let's call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the might god Ra.</p>", "9437": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> While you're there, could you pick up a few comics for my nephew's birthday?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humor featuring talking babies and anthropomorphizing pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.</p>", "9438": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look at that, that's a dent. Thank you, Howard ham-fisted Wolowitz.</p>", "9439": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Look, there are plenty of bars in Los Angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn't have to because there are no women in them.</p>", "9440": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How about those two?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Nah, they're eating peanuts. My allergies, one kiss would put me in Cedar-Sinai for a week.</p>", "9441": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I have got to learn how to draw.</p>", "9442": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC multiverse.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What's a multi-verse?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Get her out of here.</p>", "9443": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hold on. You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping Wolowitz move, and then he only need buy us a pizza?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm sorry, that really is how it works.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're tricking me. You tell me the truth. What do we get?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Raj, help me out here.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I knew it! PS3, definitely PS3. Who would pick a mountain bike?</p>", "9444": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Even though the menu description specifies shredded?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Brown rice, not white?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good. See how it's done, Leonard?</p>", "9445": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, new topic, please. Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5A are moving out?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Shh-shh-shh!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> The people upstairs are moving out.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The horror!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why would you just say something like that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, no, no, no, no, no, no-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> How else was I supposed to say it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. You dont just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while.</p>", "9446": "<p><strong>Alicia:</strong> I'm Alicia. I'm moving in upstairs.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That is so great. Oh, I'm Leonard, I live downstairs. Upstairs from here, but under you. Not under you per se, but under your apartment.<br/><strong>Alicia:</strong> That's nice.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, it is.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate, hello.</p>", "9447": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello. On a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline?<br/><strong>Alicia:</strong> Freakishly feline?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is that your answer or do you not understand the question? We'll come back to that one.</p>", "9448": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon...<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hang on. Are you now or have you ever been a salsa, Irish folk or break-dancer?<br/><strong>Alicia:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're making her uncomfortable.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry. Well, if it helps you feel any better you're doing very well so far. Next question, are you fertile?<br/><strong>Alicia:</strong> What?!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.<br/><strong>Alicia:</strong> I have no immediate plans.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If that changes, let me know. And finally, area rugs, pro or con?<br/><strong>Alicia:</strong> Pro?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Alicia?<br/><strong>Alicia:</strong> Yes?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Welcome to the building.</p>", "9449": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, Penny. this is Alicia, our new neighbor.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Alicia:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm helping.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I can see.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Alicia's non-musical, childless and pro-rug. She's still on probation, of course, but I like her.</p>", "9450": "<p><strong>Alicia:</strong> Cool t-shirt.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, yeah, I don't usually dress like this. I'm going jogging.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You don't jog.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I can start.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> True, but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you're out of clean clothes again.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thank you, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're welcome, Penny.</br></p>", "9451": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Congratulations, I see you did your laundry.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, sort of.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How does one sort of-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I bought new clothes, okay?</p>", "9452": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Is Leonard around?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He's upstairs at Alicias.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. all right, that's cool, no biggie. He said he'd help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait. What exactly is he doing up there?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me, he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo.</p>", "9453": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, they're all up there, huh? Hmm, typical.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's axiomatically atypical. Up until recently, they did not know Alicia, and had no encounters with her in a previous location. They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants, so your characterization of their behavior as typical Is demonstrably fallacious.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, now I see the giant squid head.</p>", "9454": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, I thought about renting this apartment, but I'm really more of a downtown loft kind of guy.<br/><strong>Alicia:</strong> Cool. So are you in a loft now?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, actually I'm, uh, living with a woman in Altadena. Purely platonic, she's also my maid.<br/><strong>Alicia:</strong> Sounds like a sweet deal.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I won't lie, it's pretty dope.</p>", "9455": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this, I read the best science joke on the Internet. Alicia, you won't get it, but it's right up their alley. Anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlor every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself, and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he's doing.<br/>\nThe man says, \"Well, I'm a physicist, and (emphasis) quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.\"<br/>\nThe owner then says, Well, lots of single, beautiful women come in here every day, why don't you buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you?\" And the physicist says, \"Yeah, but what are the odds of that happening?\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's a little insulting, don't you think?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> How would I know? I'm not even sure I get it.</p>", "9456": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, Penny, there's something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. When this happens, the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What are you saying, that I'm threatened by Alicia? That I'm like the old queen of the hive and it's just time for me to go?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm just talking about bees. They're on the Discovery Channel. What are you talking about?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Bees.</p>", "9457": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, what do we got going on tonight, huh? Playing Halo watching Battlestar, drop some Mentos in Diet Coke?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You want to watch Battlestar?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What can I say? I got my geek on, boys.</p>", "9458": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I cannot believe they're letting her just use them like that. I mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week, she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle's house in Orange County to pick up her TV?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You once had Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Apples and oranges here, Sheldon. I'm telling you, that girl is a user, ice-skating through the life on her looks, taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows. It creams my corn.</p>", "9459": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> I like Green Lantern, I'm just saying it's pretty lame that he can be defeated by the color yellow.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Only the modern Green Lantern is vulnerable to yellow.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Golden age Green Lantern was vulnerable to wood.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Great, so I can take them both out with a number-two pencil?</p>", "9460": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, you know what'd be a great idea? We get some girls over here and play Laser Obstacle Strip Chess.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing to play that, you don't want to see naked.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You underestimate me.</p>", "9461": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, it's a little juvenile. I mean, it kind of looks like the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, it doesn't.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Please, Dateline could use it to attract predators.</p>", "9462": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Too bad. You know the rules of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess. Leonard died again, Sheldon. You're up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, I must forfeit.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because it's almost eleven o'clock.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So ... Penny has a don't knock on my door before eleven o'clock or I punch you in the throat rule.</p>", "9463": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property, or chattels, is transferred from one person, the bailor, to another person, the bailee.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look. I started a business.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Obviously, not a cleaning business.</p>", "9464": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, don't you get it? If this takes off, I won't have to be a waitress anymore.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Another waitress.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's her name?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't know.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And you're going to let her handle my food?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Nancy. Her name is Nancy.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think you're just making that up.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, I'm sorry about your hamburger, okay? I just don't want to be a waitress for the rest of my life.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Fine, cheeseburger.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Maybe I'd be better off with Nancy.</p>", "9465": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, ten dollars a day times five days a week, times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> That's all?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Before taxes.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, I don't have to pay taxes on this stuff.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe the Internal Revenue Service would strongly disagree.</br></p>", "9466": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just to be clear here, you're asking for my assistance.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I understand.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And you're not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while I'm doing so.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good. Let's begin with the premise that everything you've done up to this point is wrong.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, imagine that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sarcasm. Good-bye.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, sorry. Wait, please come back.</p>", "9467": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course, but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure, we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process. To start with, she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, it's a bitch.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Uh, I've seen this before.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's a common stripper problem. They dance, they sweat, they clump.</p>", "9468": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Actually, I'm thinking about this one stripper named Vega. But sure, calcium sulphate could work.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let's think out of the box for a moment. How about a molecular sieve?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I've got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wow.</p>", "9469": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Alright, let me put it this way. Your gross receipts on this one order will be over $3,000 for one night's work.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You guys get started.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Going online to buy shoes!</p>", "9470": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, that, right there, that equivocation and self-doubt, that is not the American spirit. Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo? Did Jim Bowie?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> They didn't quit. They were massacred by, like, a gazillion angry Mexicans.</p>", "9471": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe I'm hearing some negativity on the factory floor.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, the labor force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured. Any counterproductive grumbling must be skilfully headed off by management. Observe. Hey! Less talk, more work!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Nicely done.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you. You hear any union talk, you let me know.</p>", "9472": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have complete faith that you will make them. Good night.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, no. But, Sheldon, without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're right, of course.</p>", "9473": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Here, this will help.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Very well, but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics, you're going to have to answer to my mother.</p>", "9474": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Look at Planck's Constant. People say it's arbitrary. It could not be less arbitrary. If it varied even slightly, life as we know it would not exist. Bam! Now, let's reconsider the entire argument, but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause, so you are thinking of a universe that's not expanding from the center. No, it is retreating from a, from a possibility space. Bam! This is a space where we are all essentially Alice through the Looking Glass, standing in front the Red Queen, and we're being offered a cracker to quench our thirst. Bam! Of course, in another universe, let's call it universe prime, there's another Sheldon. Let's call him Sheldon prime...<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We should have let him go to bed.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Bam.</p>", "9475": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can't believe we actually did it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> 1,000 friggin' Penny Blossoms.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I just want you guys to know I am really grateful for your help, and for every dollar I make, I'm going to give you 20 cents.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's your entire profit margin.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh. Then never mind.</p>", "9476": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on. What about the living organism of the workforce and the American spirit and Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Davy Crockett. Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.</p>", "9477": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, Raj, hand me the number six torque screwdriver.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Stop. We can't do this. It's not right.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon, you have two choices. Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo, or you delete stuff before we go out of town.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But once you open the box, you've voided the warranty. The warranty is a sacred covenant we've entered into with the manufacturer. He offers to stand by his equipment, and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware. This little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, then we wont touch the hard drive. We'll just erase the first season of Battlestar.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (Rips off the sticker) There. We're outlaws.</p>", "9478": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> (Bringing a pink suitcase) Here you go, Leonard. Is this going to be big enough?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's perfect.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> For taking daffodils to your unicorn.</p>", "9479": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I love San Francisco. I wish I was going with you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I understand your envy. This is a can't miss symposium. There are going to be discussions on bio-organic cellular computer devices, the advancements in multi-threaded task completion, plus a round table on the non-equilibrium Green's function approach to the photoionization process in atoms.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> When I go, I usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars.</p>", "9480": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> George Smoot is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, one of the great minds of our time. His work in black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> It's kind of a funny name, though, Smoot.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's like talking to a chimp.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, now that I've been completely insulted, have a good flight.</br></p>", "9481": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, we're all going over to the Apple store to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar. You want to come?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I always enjoy that, but I'm a little busy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm simplifying the task of packing for our trip. See, by attaching RFID tags to my clothing, it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand. I will then cross-reference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, that does sound much simpler. How long is this going to take?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Assuming I can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes. Plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation.</p>", "9482": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's over the wheelbase. Are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre-1980 Pullman-built Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, we've been on this train 90 seconds, and you've already said a thousand words. Just tell us where to sit and shut up.</p>", "9483": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Here. I'm hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails, your sour disposition will abate.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, maybe. Meanwhile back in the 21st century, people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position 'cause it's time to land in San Francisco.</p>", "9484": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It's not so bad, really. At least these trains have modern plumbing. In India, you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of Rajasthan.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He is referring, of course, to third class on Indian Railways' magnificent Ranakpur Express and its twelve hundred kilometer journey from Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, look, now he's boring on an international scale.</p>", "9485": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What would Summer Glau be doing riding the train?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe John Connor's aboard and shes protecting him from an evil Terminator.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Unlikely. That's a television show, Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course, if SkyNet actually did exist in the future, a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send Terminators back posing as actors who have played Terminators in popular films and television series, lulling us into a false sense of security, i.e., that's Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor Chronicles. No, Summer, don't kill me! I'm pro-robot! Argh!</p>", "9486": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You're overlooking something. I have 11 hours with her in a confined space. Unless she#s willing to jump off a moving train, tuck and roll down the side of a hill, she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste that is Howard Wolowitz.</p>", "9487": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm confused. I thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, let me explain to you how this works.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's Summer Glau.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's it.</p>", "9488": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Excuse me, but what about me? Why don't I get a shot?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine, go ahead. Take a shot.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, I've already got a gorgeous blond back home that I can't score with. I think I'll let you two take this one.</p>", "9489": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Sheldon, is there a place on this train to get alcohol?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Interesting that you ask. The Coast Starlight recently added the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car. Built in 1956 and originally known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car, the lower level is a theater-<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah-yeah, which way?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> --and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if you're going as far as Portland.</p>", "9490": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So aren't you going to go talk to her?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I will, I'm just working on my opening line.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She's probably heard every possible line, Howard. Why don't you just try hello?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, no, no, that always creeps girls out. I need to come up with something thats funny, smart and delicately suggests that my sexual endowment is disproportionate to my physical stature.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're going to need more than 11 hours.</p>", "9491": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's the matter?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I forgot my flash drive.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So we have to go back.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, Sheldon, I'm going to say why and your answer cannot be because I forgot my flash drive.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You don't understand. My flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of M-theory effects in the early universe that I was going to give to George Smoot at the conference.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's brilliant. He needs to read it.</p>", "9492": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So you'll send him an e-mail when we get back.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Then I won't get to see his face light up as he reads it.</p>", "9493": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, there's nothing you can do about it, so relax, sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You forgot your flash drive, You forgot your flash drive...<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Only ten hours, 55 minutes to go.</p>", "9494": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, I've found the perfect solution. We get off the train at the next stop in Oxnard. We then take the 1:13 train back to Union Station. We take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive, and then race to San Luis Obispo, where, assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic, we'll meet the train.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I've got a better idea.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you going to be sarcastic?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.</p>", "9495": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> But look, Penny's home. Why don't we just call her, have her go in the apartment, get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The key is hidden in my room.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny would have to go into my room.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> People don't go in my room!</br></p>", "9496": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> It's hot in here. It must be Summer.<br/><strong>Summer Glau:</strong> That's cute.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Really? I just made it up. Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?<br/><strong>Summer Glau:</strong> Oh, yeah, I loved it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's loosely based on my life.</p>", "9497": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> The theater is above a bowling alley, so it's a little noisy, but it might be the only chance I'll ever get to play Anne Frank. And the director is brilliant. He uses the bowling sounds as, like, Nazi artillery.</p>", "9498": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, step four. Do you see that small plastic case on my dresser?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Your dresser? Who is this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's Sheldon.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, hey, Sheldon! How is San Francisco?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not in San Francisco. I'm on a train. Were you even listening to me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, no, I was talking to my friend, but what's up?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's up? I'll tell you whats up. I'm in a crisis situation, and I need you to marshal your powers of concentration, limited as they may be-</p>", "9499": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> He's calling to ask you a favor. You might be confused because he didn't use the words, Penny, Sheldon, please or favor.</p>", "9500": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> And that bright little star peeking her head out early today, that's Venus.<br/><strong>Summer Glau:</strong> That is so cool. You really know a lot about space.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Come on. When you were on TV in Firefly, you were actually in space.<br/><strong>Summer Glau:</strong> You're not one of those guys who really believe that, are you?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You mean one of the hopeless geeks? No. Those are crazy people. Howard, be a dear and get me another one of these. Now, him, he's one of those geeks.</p>", "9501": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted, I need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement. ... Easement. It's a legal right of access. ... Good grief. What? No, don't put me on hold. Aw.</p>", "9502": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Do you believe him? Normally around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato. Put one beer in him, and he's M. Night Charmalarmalon.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Is that what he's drinking? It's not even real beer.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look at it. Non-alcoholic beer.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What's going on?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. Some sort of placebo effect, I guess.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Placebo, you say. Interesting.</p>", "9503": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, I'm still here. Where am I going? I'm on a train. Now, what you'll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a Hoberman's sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite. Hoberman's Sphere. It's a collapsible icosidodecahedron. No, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock.</p>", "9504": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Actually, in India, the names of constellations are different. Where you have the Big Dipper, we have the Big Curry Pot.<br/><strong>Summer Glau:</strong> You're making that up.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You got me. Now what are you going to do with me?</p>", "9505": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hi, I'm the small package good things come in.</p>", "9506": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, Penny. It's Leonard.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, Leonard. How's the train ride?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Delightful. Listen, I don't know what you're doing right now, but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of Sheldon's mouth.</p>", "9507": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> And did you know the word \"pumpernickel\" comes from the German words pumper and nickel, which loosely translates to fart goblin?</p>", "9508": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're holding a Japanese puzzle box, which takes ten precise moves to open. First, locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left. Then, on the opposite end of the box, slide the entire panel down two millimetres. You'll hear a slight click.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hang on. Sheldon, do you have any emotional attachment to this box?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, it's a novelty I ordered off the Internet. Now, did you hear the click?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Not yet. (Puts the box on the ground and stomps on it)There it is.</p>", "9509": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, I'm thinking, you won the Nobel Prize what, three years ago? So you must deal with a whole lot of what has Smoot done lately? My thought is we continue my research as a team, you know, Cooper-Smoot, alphabetical, and when we win the Nobel Prize, you'll be back on top.<br/><strong>George Smoot:</strong> With all due respect, Dr. Cooper, are you on crack?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fine! Smoot-Cooper. Wow, what a diva.</p>", "9510": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> This conference is kind of a big thing. The keynote address is being delivered by George Smoot.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh my God, the George Smoot?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You've heard of him?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Of course I haven't.</br></p>", "9511": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wow, teasing the guys at the Apple Store seems a little redundant now.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't follow.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I wouldn't expect you to.</p>", "9512": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight, one of the great American trains operating on one of the classic American routes. On this side, you'll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation, while on your side, you'll be treated to 350 miles of Costcos, Jiffy Lubes, and cinderblock homes with above-ground pools.</p>", "9513": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, I owe you an apology. Taking the train was a stroke of brilliance. I've actually got a shot with a Terminator.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, please. When it comes to Terminators, you've got a better shot of scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>", "9514": "<p><strong>Leslie:</strong> Hey, are you enjoying that prototyper I got you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, it's great. Everybody in the Engineering Department is eating their hearts out.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Isn't it nice when your good fortune makes others miserable?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, most people don't get that.</p>", "9515": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I told you, my mom has spider veins. I had to take her to the laser clinic.</p>", "9516": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, more cutbacks.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Unacceptable. It baffles me why they don't simply let some of you go so that there's money available for my research.</p>", "9517": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know what baffles me, Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Based on your academic record, any number of things, I would imagine.</p>", "9518": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Court-martial, shmort-martial, Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl I've ever had sex with. I mean, for free.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And plus, you got a rapid prototyper. That's an expensive piece of equipment, dude.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay. One way to look at this is I'm getting new equipment and you're not, and that's unfair. But a better way to look at this is that I'm getting sex and you're not, and that's delightful.<br/></p>", "9519": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That is my spot. In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.</p>", "9520": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle.</p>", "9521": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't come in, Ma.<br/>\nMrs. <strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong><strong>Leslie:</strong></strong> He's got company.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, there's the arrhythmia.<br/>\nMrs. <strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Is she Jewish?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Are you Jewish?<br/><strong><strong>Leslie:</strong></strong> No.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes!</p>", "9522": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> There's no discernible butt print.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, come on. (Sits and wiggles around) There, butt print.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's too small and perfect.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're welcome.</p>", "9523": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why don't you just eat in your desk chair?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why don't I just eat in my desk chair?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Here we go.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That is my desk chair, that's where I work. I don't eat in my desk chair and I don't work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot.</p>", "9524": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, ma, you got to rent me a tux!<br/>\nMrs. <strong>Wolowitz:</strong> Right now? What kind of sex are you having up there?</p>", "9525": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why are you crouching there?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is my spot. Where else am I supposed to crouch?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know, Texas?</br></p>", "9526": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny, I think I know what to do. Sheldon, I have some more bad news.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> More?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. From Szechuan Palace.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What? Where did my cashew chicken come from?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Golden Dragon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. No, this isn't right. Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, well, before they went out of business, I bought 4,000 containers. I keep them in the trunk of my car.</p>", "9527": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's real? What isn't? How can I know?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You did make that up, right?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, God, I wish I had.</p>", "9528": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Fellas, please.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Penny, come on, we were just finding our sound.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You found it. It's the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.</p>", "9529": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> (On the phone) I'm really very busy. Is there any way that we can put this off until I have more time to prepare? ... Of course. But, uh, you understand my trepidation.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What's that about?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Not a clue.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can't we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This should be fairly easy to deduce. He's holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he's using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I didn't realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess there's no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He's referring to an activity he has done before. It's unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.</p>", "9530": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Well, that is one of my degrees. My primary field is neuroscience.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, well, I'm an actress.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What do you mean why?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Well, there are studies that suggest that many who go into the performing arts suffer from an external locus of identity.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I don't know what that means.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Well, it means you value yourself only as others value you, which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Tell me about it.</p>", "9531": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I know my dad wanted a boy. I just, I tried being good at sports, but I hated getting dirty!<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> And then, I'm assuming you entered adolescence.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh-huh. He called me Slugger until I got my first training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasn't Slugger anymore. (As Leonard opens the door) Your mother's here!</p>", "9532": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Here's your tea, mother.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oolong?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Loose, not bagged?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Steeped three minutes?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Two-percent milk?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Warmed separately?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> One teaspoon sugar?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Raw sugar?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> It's cold.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'll start again.</p>", "9533": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.</p>", "9534": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Here's your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking about?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Swell. If you're lucky, maybe she'll show you the PowerPoint presentation.</p>", "9535": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, Mother, what's new?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> You'll have to be more specific.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right. Uh, what's new with you?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oh, well, I've been having some fascinating menopausal symptoms recently.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe something less personal.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oh. Your Uncle Floyd died.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, my God. What happened?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> His heart stopped beating. I have to urinate.</p>", "9536": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What a remarkable woman.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, I thought you guys might hit it off.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I envy you your childhood.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and I'm betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn't eat your Brussels sprouts.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, you don't give your mother enough credit. She's warm, she's loving, she doesn't glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG, I had to attach my own electrodes.</p>", "9537": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So, Dr. Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Please, don't go there, Howard.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I understand that unlike Leonard, they're at the top of their respective fields.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Boy, you suck.</p>", "9538": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why are you doing this?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know the rules. You brought your mom to work, you must suffer.</p>", "9539": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, you're like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, meesa think yousa lookin so, so sad.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Nope, I think mocking you is more fun.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Next time, don't yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day?</p>", "9540": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> So, where were we?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Howard lives with his mother and Raj cant speak to women unless hes drunk. Go.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> That's fascinating. Selective mutism is quite rare. On the other hand, an adult Jewish male living with his mother is so common it borders on sociological clich.</br></p>", "9541": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You brought your husband to work, you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha.</p>", "9542": "<p><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Leonard, it's one o'clock, weren't you going to show me your laboratory at one o'clock?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> There's no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> But it's one o'clock, you were going to show me your laboratory at one o'clock.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one o'clock.</p>", "9543": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I think you'll find my work pretty interesting. I'm attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> So, no original research?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Well, what's the point of my seeing it? I could just read the paper the Italians wrote.</p>", "9544": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Just for the record, we're not in an ersatz homosexual relationship.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, then why didn't you say that to her?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Why is it always my responsibility?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's not always your responsibility. I swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I can't believe you're bringing that up.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I didn't bring it up. You did.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We'll talk about this later.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You always say that, but we never do.</p>", "9545": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You got alcohol?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Your mom still here?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yep.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on in.</p>", "9546": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, wait, she's not gonna come here looking for you, is she?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh my God. What happened?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Geez, what a fun couple.</p>", "9547": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn't let go. Your mother told me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Of course she did. Anyway, that's not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> A hugging machine?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. I got a dressmaker's mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, that is so sad.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know what the saddest part was?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> My father used to borrow it.</p>", "9548": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'd love to see a scan of your brain sometime.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Oh, I'll send you a link, but its physiology is fairly unimpressive.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I can't believe that.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence suggests an attempt at flattery.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My apologies. I've been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Understandable.</p>", "9549": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can I make you a cup of tea?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I doubt it, but if anyone has a chance, it's probably you.</p>", "9550": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I feel very comfortable around you.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I feel very comfortable around you, too.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's surprising because I generally dont feel comfortable around, well, anyone.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Nor I.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Is that a rhetorical point or would you like to do the math?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'd like to do the math.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I'd like that, too.</p>", "9551": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, what do you think?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I'm very tempted. I'm just not sure it's appropriate with my son's roommate.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Normally, I'd feel the same way. But based on everything I've observed about us, I can't help but speculate we'd be very good together.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> True. I've had a similar observation. It's certainly something I could never do with my husband.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. It's quite satisfying.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> I see what you're doing. You're appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You see right through me, don't you?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Only when you're in a CAT scanner.</p>", "9552": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Get out!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She said shush. I should have shushed.</p>", "9553": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, Mother. Um, have a nice flight.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> That's not really in my control, is it?</p>", "9554": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I mean, my mom could've just said, Bob, get over it, she's a girl, move on. But she didn't. Not one word.<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Interesting. Would you be willing to fly to New Jersey and discuss your relationship with your parents during a brain scan?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Would it help?<br/><strong>Beverly Hofstadter:</strong> Well, it would help me.</p>", "9555": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favor of abandoning our game and confronting Penny's steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him?<br>\nSay hi to Kurt for us.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor, didn't Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They did.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> They had a terrible time of it, Leonard.</br></p>", "9556": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> The building manager's showing an apartment downstairs, and I haven't paid my rent.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I see. Penny, I'm not sure I'm comfortable harboring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation.</p>", "9557": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, you got a lot of money in there.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's why it's guarded by snakes.</p>", "9558": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with admantium like Wolverine.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Are they working on that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I sincerely hope so.</p>", "9559": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I'll pay you back as soon as I can.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course you will. It's impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.</p>", "9560": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Here you go. Oh, you owe me another two dollars. The price of mu-shu pork went up.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> It's getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew.</p>", "9561": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I've been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days and I wanted something different. So sue me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.</p>", "9562": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn't care when he gets the money back. It's actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn't make you want to, you know, kill him.</p>", "9563": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, no, I can't give up my acting classes. I'm a professional actress.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You've had an acting job where you got paid?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That is not the definition of professional.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Actually, it kind of - let's keep looking.</p>", "9564": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, remember Kurt?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Your ex-boyfriend?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> He was drunk.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I would hope so.</p>", "9565": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Ugh. This mu-shu pork is burning a hole through me duodenum.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Leviticus 11:3 \"Only that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud among the beasts shall ye at.\"<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita every time you scarf down a whopper?</p>", "9566": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Nope, I wanna climb some rocks.</p>", "9567": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Come on, they have birthday parties here. Little kids climb this.</p>", "9568": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Hey, look at you Cooper. You're almost half way to the top.</p>", "9569": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Hello to you, too!</p>", "9570": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Hello. How did I walk past you? I'm Barry.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Penny.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> That's not a very hot name. I'm gonna call you Roxanne.</br></p>", "9571": "<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. Also, I'm given to understand that your mother is overweight.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Raj</strong>: Oh, snap.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Now of course if that is a result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony, I withdraw that comment. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Raj</strong>: What difference does it make, fat is fat.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Sheldon</strong>: There are boundaries!<br/></p>", "9572": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Well, if you have any delusions about entering him against my robot, the Kripke Crippler, in the Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational - AKA the SCRFLRRI - his name is going to be Scrap Metal.</p>", "9573": "<p>(O.S. - In video) <strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> As you can see, the Kripke Crippler is reducing the Chevy Cavalier to rubble.</p>", "9574": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Nice little bot you've got here.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> I'm aware.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's this do? Spin?<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Yeah, at 3400 RPM. It can cut through steel like it was rubber.</p>", "9575": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> What is his problem?</p>", "9576": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So what do you think, Howard? It's not that bad, right?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> A little electrical tape, some solder ... Are you insane? I've seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this.</p>", "9577": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> I will, however, give you the opportunity to concede my superiority now and offer my your robot as the spoils of war.</p>", "9578": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Never. I'd rather see MONTE dead than in your hands.<br/><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> That can easily be arranged.</p>", "9579": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Here's my home number, here's my cell, here's my office, here's my parents' number up in New Jersey, they always know how to reach me.</p>", "9580": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> \"Kandorian dry cleaner-\" I give up, you can't have a rational argument with this man.</p>", "9581": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Whoa. Humongous man crush, dude.</p>", "9582": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Yep. It's officially a bro-mance.</p>", "9583": "<p><strong>Dave:</strong> I don't know how you live next door to that without doing something about it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Actually, science is my lady.</p>", "9584": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. It's as if my head were trapped in the pajamas of a sultan.</p>", "9585": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I've been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> I never said that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe I heard you wrong. A lot of words sound like  yoga.</br></p>", "9586": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons. Very thoughtful.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, and I checked. Not letting the bike fall on you while standing still is lesson one.</p>", "9587": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, then I think you'll appreciate what I got you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay. 101 Totally Cool Science Experiments for Kids.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You know, 'cause you're so into science.</p>", "9588": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now, to review, the following provisions are hereby activated. In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf, the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal. Next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells. Third, the bathroom schedule. Now, I'm given to understand women have difference needs, so we'll have to discuss that.</p>", "9589": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, there's one more thing. Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement, I'm calling an emergency meeting.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, you're not.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails.<br/></p>", "9590": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I gave it a lot of thought and I decided it was time for us to live together.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Leonard, huge mistake. There's a whole buffet of women out there and you're just standing in the corner eating the same devilled egg over and over again.</p>", "9591": "<p><strong>Stephanie:</strong> I just performed a Sheldonectomy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Careful, if you don't get it all, it'll only come back worse.</p>", "9592": "<p><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Yup, theres no inflammation at all, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Then it must be a tumor.<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> I Seriously doubt it.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe its a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is that possible? I used to get those all the time. Even in church.</p>", "9593": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, there's one more thing. Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement, I'm calling an emergency meeting.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, you're not.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails. I'd like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That being said, we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon \"cohabitation\" rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together.</p>", "9594": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We're not living together.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I beg to disagree. \"A girlfriend shall be deemed quote living with un-quote Leonard when she has stayed over for A. ten consecutive nights, or B. more than nine nights in three week period, or C. all the weekends of a given month plus three weeknights.\"<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's absurd.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hmm, yes, you did.</p>", "9595": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm going to bed.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> At least take this with you. Look, and have Stephanie initial here, here, here, here and here. This states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument.</p>", "9596": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good morning, Dr. Stephanie. I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh come on! Sheldon, we don't ask questions like that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I heard you ask it over and over. How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> He did very nicely.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> See? She's not offended. And now you finally have an answer.</p>", "9597": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Out of coffee. Need coffee.<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Uh, hello.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hi! Stephanie, right?<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Uh-huh. And, and, and you are?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm Penny, I live across the hall. I've heard a lot about you.<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mm-hmm.<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> I haven't heard a thing about you. Leonard? Why haven't I heard a thing about this woman who lives across the hall and comes into your apartment in the morning in her underwear?</p>", "9598": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> She's heard about you because we're, you know, involved. And you haven't heard about her because ... I never slept with her, I swear!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In Leonard's defense, it wasn't for lack of trying.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're welcome, Leonard.</p>", "9599": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, I'm just saying, um, Penny is one of our many neighbors, you know, and in our building, neighbors come and go, it's very casual, no dress code. In fact, some mornings I'll just mosey down to the third floor in my pajamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? I have never once been invited to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> She doesn't like you.</p>", "9600": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, that's Stephanie, huh?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why do I feel like I'm the one that just got the prostate exam?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, she seems very nice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, she is. She's terrific, and shes proving to be a valuable roommate.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Roommate? You guys are living together?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Like hippies.</br></p>", "9601": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> In fact, I gave it a lot of thought and I decided it was time for us to live together.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Uh, Leonard, huge mistake. There's a whole buffet of women out there and you're just standing in the corner eating the same deviled egg over and over again.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> At least I have an egg. What do you have?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> A veritable smrgsbord of potential sexual partners. See the blond over there? I can hit on her and you can't.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, go hit on her.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> She's not my type.</p>", "9602": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't care what you guys think, Stephanie and I are very happy living together. I will give either of you 20 dollars, right now to trade pants with me!</p>", "9603": "<p><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Sheldon, what are you doing here?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hang on. 130 over 80. A little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on. And by the way, the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer.<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Didn't they teach you that in medical school?</p>", "9604": "<p><strong>Stephanie:</strong> I'm kinda busy here, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I understand. All I need is for you to authorize these tests.<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> A cardiac stress test, a full body MRI, an electromyogram, a CBC, baseline glucose, upper GI?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, and an exploratory laparoscopy. Last time I had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions.<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Go home, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Can I at least have the upper GI? I already drank the barium!</p>", "9605": "<p><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Oh, no!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wha...?<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> You were right. Your larynx is terribly inflamed. I mean, I've never seen anything like it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I knew it! What do I do?<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> You're going to need to stop talking immediately.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> For how-<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> D-d-d-d! Immediately.</p>", "9606": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, that'll slow it down.</p>", "9607": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey. Nice sweater.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, Stephanie got it for me. It's kind of fun.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's got a big bird on it, dude.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, yeah, that's the fun part. We're also getting new curtains for my bedroom, and a dust ruffle, and a duvet, and I don't even know what a duvet is but I'm pretty sure if I did I wouldn't want one, but every time I talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You're lucky. With me, it's usually the other way around.</p>", "9608": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, if you can't talk to her, why don't you just text her?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Isn't that kind of cowardly?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, yeah. It's beyond contemptible.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's true, but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sold.</p>", "9609": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, hello.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What is shaking?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm sorry?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's colloquial, a conversation opener. So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What's wrong with you? You're freaking me out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm striking up a casual conversation with you. S'up?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Please don't do that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, But I'm given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it's more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> So, this wasn't the awkward part?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No.</p>", "9610": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister's guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball's chance in a CAT scanner.</p>", "9611": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I do. Do you? Because frankly, you've been in a foul mood since I sat down.</p>", "9612": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hi, Stephanie. I'm sorry I'm late, but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What invitation?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> \"We're going to the movies.\" What movie? What theater? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn't have done a better job.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, clearly I could have.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up.</p>", "9613": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is Stephanie's Facebook page. Now, where it should say in a relationship, what does it say?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Stephanie Barnett is single.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Who's Mike? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?</p>", "9614": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You don't see it, do you? We're losing her.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, I'm going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship, I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm afraid I can't allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104 Section A, you are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Give me one good reason why not.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because this is not Star Trek.</p>", "9615": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, would you like to come in?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I suppose I could spare a few minutes. (Looking at Penny's apartment) Were you robbed?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How can you be sure?</br></p>", "9616": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, what do you want?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm certain this will come as no surprise to you, but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> He's having problems with Stephanie?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She's sending virtual livestock to random men on the Internet.</p>", "9617": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She's sending virtual livestock to random men on the Internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Again, urban slang. In which, I believe I'm gaining remarkable fluency. So, what is the down and the low? And don't worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.</p>", "9618": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> More to the point, it's about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, I don't think you can.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, why not?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Look at Leonard's record. 27 days with Joyce Kim.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> During which she defected to North Korea.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> For which she awarded him the nickname \"speed of light Leonard.\"<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And a three hour dinner with Penny.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Based on the geometric progression, his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes.</p>", "9619": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Great. New topic. Where are you in your menstrual cycle?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've been doing some research online, and apparently female primates, you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you, they find their mate more desirable when he's being courted by another female. Now, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. Which brings me back to my question, where are you in (Penny slams door). Clearly, I'm 14 days too early.</p>", "9620": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm helping you with Stephanie.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> By making constipated moose sounds?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. You see, when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. If the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love.</p>", "9621": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What a beautiful job Stephanie did. I might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you can't argue with her results. It's a shame it won\u2019t scar, the war wound is a time-honored badge of masculinity.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can't remember a time when you weren't talking.</p>", "9622": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> OK, I guess we have to turn to Plan B.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What's Plan B?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why wasn't that Plan A?</p>", "9623": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Howard, didn't you say you worked on the Mars Rover?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, you're mistaken.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know what you're talking about.</p>", "9624": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signaling that he'd like to talk to me in private.</p>", "9625": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I remember specifically. You started by asking if I was from Mars because my ass was out of this world.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, that does sound like me, but no.</p>", "9626": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is there some problem?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right, goodbye.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, wait. If anyone asks you where I went, you don't know.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Where are you going?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can't tell you that.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who would ask me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can't tell you that, either.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So you brought me in here to inform me that you can't tell me where you're going and you can't tell me who might ask?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, I really didn't think this through.</p>", "9627": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If someone, and of course, we don't know who this would be, does ask where you've gone, what should I say?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. Just tell them I went to the office.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Are you going to the office?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Then how can I say it convincingly?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just say, Leonard went to the office.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> All right. Leonard went to (dramatically) the office.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonard went to the office.</p>", "9628": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This would have worked out a lot better if you'd just told me you were going the office.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm going to the office.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> See, why don't I believe you?</p>", "9629": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So how was work today?<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> Busy. I removed an appendix, a gall bladder and about a foot and a half of bowel.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm hoping that's three different guys.<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> No, just the one. He didn't make it.</p>", "9630": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, who is she?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, she's a doctor.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, nice. A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Doctor doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks he's dating someone, but he's not because, in fact, you're dating her, does that make you a bad person?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, that depends.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> On what?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Is that friend Wolowitz?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Screw him. You're fine.</br></p>", "9631": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you sure?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, have you slept with her yet? ... You dog! Good for you.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Does that change things?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So why'd you ask?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm nosy. See ya.</p>", "9632": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hi, Howard. Howard?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't make the rules, Leonard.</p>", "9633": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Howard, come on, I didn't plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Did someone just feel a cold breeze?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.</p>", "9634": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In what sense is that a compromise?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, five is partway between three... Never mind.</p>", "9635": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hello, boys.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Ahoy, matey.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Noticed the eye patch, did you? It's all part of a technique I've been studying for picking up women. You employ a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye.</p>", "9636": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> (entering) Howard, your scooter's blocking my car. Aw, did you get pinkeye again?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Step one, she notices the eye patch. May I say, Penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair? (She pulls his eye patch away from his face, then lets it snap back to his face)<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, just move your stupid scooter before I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Ow.</p>", "9637": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What happened?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Howard's at the Mars Rover lab. He says he's in trouble. DEFCON 5.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> DEFCON 5? Well, there's no need to rush.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> DEFCON 5 means no danger. DEFCON 1 is a crisis.</p>", "9638": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, I picked her up in the bar. She's a doctor. One free barium enema and my mother won't care she's not Jewish.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, there were three other guys with eye patches, it was a fiasco. What did work was, \"How'd you like to visit a secret government facility?\"</p>", "9639": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So what exactly do you want us to do?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I need you and Raj to help me get the Rover out of the ditch, and I need you to get Stephanie out before somebody notices she's here. She doesn't exactly have clearance.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? They don't let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?</p>", "9640": "<p><strong>Stephanie:</strong> So are you a scientist like Howard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No one's a scientist like Howard.</p>", "9641": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> My mother is so gonna love her.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, how nice. Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison.</p>", "9642": "<p><strong>Stephanie:</strong> (Breaking away from kissing) I'm sorry. I totally interrupted you. What, what, what were you saying?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just said Howard's a terrific guy. He's got a great sense of humor, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much.<br/><strong>Stephanie:</strong> I really like that you're such a loyal friend.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, I am loyal. You know, if you look at the big picture.</p>", "9643": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Dr. Sheldon Cooper?<br/><strong>Ramona:</strong> We're having dinner.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sheldon Cooper? Tall, thin, looks a little like a giant praying mantis.<br/><strong>Ramona:</strong> He is cute, isn't he?</p>", "9644": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and some day he'll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moths wings and an exoskeleton.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares.</p>", "9645": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, how'd it go with Ramona last night?<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, great. She's smart, insightful and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me.</br></p>", "9646": "<p><strong><strong>Leslie:</strong></strong> So, Sheldon, I see you're organizing papers for the Smithsonian Museum of Dumbassery.<br/><strong>Ramona:</strong> There won't be any room until they get rid of the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, good one.</p>", "9647": "<p><strong>Ramona:</strong> Dr. Cooper, I have to tell you, your friends are holding you back.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I prefer to think of it as I'm pulling them forward.</p>", "9648": "<p><strong><strong>Leslie:</strong></strong> So, dumbass, I heard you made a grad student throw up last night.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. But why should I cater to second-rate minds?</p>", "9649": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Howard Wolowitz, department of engineering, co-designer of the International Space Station's Liquid Waste Disposal System.<br/><strong>Ramona:</strong> Ew.</p>", "9650": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz Liquid Waste Disposal System is turning a few heads as well.<br/><strong>Ramona:</strong> Again, ew.</p>", "9651": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Thank you for driving me to work.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know this is my day off, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, good. I'm not keeping you from anything.</p>", "9652": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're going up Euclid Avenue?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Mm-hmm.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, good for Leonard.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice. But you have the conn. Of course, if you're not going to slow down for the speed bumps, I withdraw my previous objection.</p>", "9653": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Here\u2019s a fun question. Do you know what the most common street name is?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The answer's tricky. It's Second Street. You see, you'd think it would be First Street, but in most towns, First Street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know, like Main Street, Broad Street, Michigan Avenue.</p>", "9654": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. I'll say an element, and uh, you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said, okay? I'll start. Helium. Now, you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y. Ooh, very clever, that's a tough one. So I go Ytterbium, which gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum, and I say Magnesium, you say Manganese, and  I say Europium, and, and you're left with Mendelevium, and there are no more M's because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium, so congratulations, you win. Do you wanna go again?</p>", "9655": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> (pulling car over) Get out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine, I'm not sure I'm capable of performing diagnostics.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I said, get out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay. I'll give it a shot. (Penny drives away)</p>", "9656": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Leonard, there you are, I'm ready to go home.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I just got here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good, perfect timing.</p>", "9657": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, I told you, I only have access to the free-electron laser at night. I can't drive you for the next few weeks.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, you said you couldn't drive me to work, this is from work.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Howard, help me out here.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, just for the fun of it, I'm gonna take his side.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Now, how do you propose I get home?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> How did you get here in the first place?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny. But I sense that's no longer an option.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, I need to get to the laser lab, you're just going to have to find someone else to take you home. [Sheldon looks to Howard]<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh damn, I picked the wrong side.</p>", "9658": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Why did Howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We had a difference of opinion.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Over what?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Whether or not he was trying to kill me. For the record, I maintain he was.</p>", "9659": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Where are you going?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'm taking you home.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, but I'm not going home. It's Wednesday. Wednesday is new comic book day. We have to go to the comic book store. And then we have to stop at Soup Plantation, it's creamy tomato soup day, and Radio Shack, there's a sale on triple-a batteries. Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I have a better idea.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You want to go to Pottery Barn first?</p>", "9660": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, sit down.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> She's in my spot. Don't look at me like that. Everybody knows that's my spot.</br></p>", "9661": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, you know  that we care about you.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> And it's because we care about you that we've decided we have to speak up.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You're hurting the people around you, sweetie.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Department of Motor Vehicles new driver handbook? But I don't have a problem.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive.</p>", "9662": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> This madness has to stop.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny's taking you to the DMV, I'm going to bed.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why Penny?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Because rock breaks scissors. Goodnight.</p>", "9663": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon, why are you arguing with the DMV?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How else are they going to learn? Look, question 2, \"When are roadways most slippery?\" Now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is, when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction.</p>", "9664": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other color. I don't want any hassles with the fuzz.</p>", "9665": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Fine, what colour do you want?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalker's lightsaber, before it was digitally remastered?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Black it is.</p>", "9666": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I haven't fastened my seat belt yet.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, fasten your seat belt.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Click. Now, are there air bags?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You don't need air bags.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What if a simulated van rear-ends me?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'll hit you in the face with a pillow.</p>", "9667": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. I quit. [After Sheldon stands up, there is a crashing sound from the driving simulation. Then pained noises from animals]<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Aw, the pet store?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software, it's amazingly detailed.</p>", "9668": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So wait,you're just gonna give up?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I'm not giving up. I never give up.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So what is it you're doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm transcending the situation. I'm clearly too evolved for driving.</p>", "9669": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, those are indicators that I'm farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No kidding.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, no, no, I'm not going to go so far as to say that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind. You know, a Homo Novus, if you will. No, that's for anthropologists to decide. But I am convinced that the reason I cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because I'm not meant to.</p>", "9670": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Homo Novus doesn't know.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, hang in there. Maybe you'll evolve into something with wings.</p>", "9671": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good morning, gentlemen.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Good morning. Is there some new kind of casual Friday I don't know about?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, he lives here now.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really? Why?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, since he won't take the bus and he's too evolved to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until I'm finished with my experiment.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> But you finished your experiment a week ago.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yep.</p>", "9672": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly, it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.</p>", "9673": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me. Thirty what, under thirty what, to watch what?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their field.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If I had a million guesses, I never would have gotten that.</p>", "9674": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> God bless that boy, I don't know what I'd do without him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You just got him this afternoon.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes, but I'm finding that having a lackey suits me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> A lackey?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry, is that politically incorrect? In India we just call them untouchables.</p>", "9675": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, good news, you don't have to sulk about Penny any more. Look, there are hundreds of Croatian women just waiting for you to contact them.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Anythingforagreencard.com?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'll lend you my user name, it's wealthybigpenis.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're joking.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, you gotta make it easy for them. They're just learning English.</br></p>", "9676": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I wanted a griffin.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> A griffin.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, half eagle, half lion.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And mythological.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Irrelevant. See, I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one. But my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them.</p>", "9677": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why don't you just tell her to leave you alone?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I did. I told her, I texted her, I sent out a very emphatic Twitter. I even changed my Facebook status to Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny would leave him alone. I don't know what else to do.</p>", "9678": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I can't get the damned key out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well that's not surprising. That Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge-mounted cylinders, whereas the key for your Volkswagon uses a center cylinder system.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Thank you, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're welcome.</p>", "9679": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Point of inquiry, why did you put your car key in the door lock?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why? I'll tell you why. Because today I had an audition, it took me two hours to get there, I waited an hour for my turn, and before I could even start they told me I looked too Midwest for the part. Too Midwest? What the hell does that even mean?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, the American Midwest was mostly settled by Scandinavian and Germanic peoples who, well they have a characteristic facial bone structure...<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know what it means, Sheldon!</p>", "9680": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> God, you know, I have been in L.A. for almost two years now, and I haven't got a single acting job. I have accomplished nothing, haven't gotten a raise at work, haven't even had sex in six months, and just now when I was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and I ate it.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures. They're almost pure protein.</p>", "9681": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. But returning to your key conundrum, perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I did, and he said he'll get here when he gets here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And you're frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No! I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly.</p>", "9682": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Listen, I need to talk to Sheldon.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (Raj whispers in his ear) No, that's what she said, Sheldon.</p>", "9683": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, look, I bought the game, and I've been exploring the Island of Tordage but I can't figure out how to get past the guard captain.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Do you have the enchanted sword?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No. No, I have a bronze dagger.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You can't slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger. My Lord, it's like the car key in your apartment door all over again.</p>", "9684": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> What the frak?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Beats me. They were playing all last night too.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's like some kind of weird comic book crossover.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Like if Hulk were dating Peppermint Patty.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I always thought Peppermint Patty was a lesbian?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, that's Marcie. Peppermint Patty's just athletic.</p>", "9685": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There you go, one enchanted sword.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Right, gimme, gimme, gimme, I want to kill the guard captain. (Leaves)<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That girl needs to get a life.</p>", "9686": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Here's the problem. I was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in Buckman 204, and Dr Winkle just wantonly ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> It wasn't even an official sign-up sheet. He printed it himself and he put his name down in every slot for the next six months.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If it is a crime to ensure that the universities resources are not being squandered chasing sub-atomic wild geese then I plead guilty.</p>", "9687": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, you have to do something about Penny. She is interfering with my sleep, she's interfering with my work, and if I had another significant aspect of my life, I'm sure she'd be interfering with that too.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why should I do something? You're the one who introduced her to online gaming.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, yes, but you're the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If you'd simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening.</p>", "9688": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why don't you just tell her to leave you alone?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I did. I told her, I texted her, I sent out a very emphatic twitter. I even changed my Facebook status to Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny would leave him alone. I don't know what else to do.</p>", "9689": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, what am I supposed to do?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know, but if you don't figure something out, I warn you I shall become very difficult to live with.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You mean, up until now we've been experiencing the happy fun time Sheldon?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'll go talk to her.</p>", "9690": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> No, Fritz, I need you on my flank. No, I don't know German. Flankenzie, flankenzie!</p>", "9691": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey Penny.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Busy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, I see that. Shouldn't you be at work?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't work on Mondays.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's Thursday.</br></p>", "9692": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Listen, Penny.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, Queen Penelope AFK. What?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, um, here's the thing, um, sometimes people, good people, you know, they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own, you know, kind of, addicted.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, get to the point, I'm about to level up here.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, i-i-it's just if a person doesn't have a sense of achievement in their real life it's easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, jabber jabber jabber, okay boys, Queen Penelope's back online.</p>", "9693": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> She's gotten really hooked on Age of Conan, she's playing non-stop.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ah, yes, online gaming addiction. There's nothing worse than having that multi-player monkey on your back.</p>", "9694": "<p><strong>Leslie:</strong> Well, I would postulate that she's escaping into the online world to compensate for her sexual frustration.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I do that too. But probably in a different way.</p>", "9695": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's not what she's doing, Leslie. She's just trying to shore up her self esteem. It has nothing to do with sex.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Everything has to do with sex.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Mmmm, testify. (Raises his hand for a high-five)<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> I'm not touching that.</p>", "9696": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Leslie, you are way off base here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hang on, Leonard, while I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Thank you. My point is that Tinkerbell just needs to get her some.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Some what? Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse.</p>", "9697": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So listen, would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands, or staying at home curled up with a good book?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> These are market research questions. I'm filling out the online registration for your game.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, okay, wild adventure.</p>", "9698": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's on the registration?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh yes, it's quite extensive. But if we complete it, we get a free expansion pack: 75 additional quests.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, awesome. Okay, I totally like to initiate, I'm a big old five.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good to know. Big ol' five.</p>", "9699": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, this is Tom.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hi, Tom. Sheldon? Didn't I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, you were very clear. As was everyone else at the table. Tom, however, has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for Penny.</p>", "9700": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Chosen by science?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, what passes for science on dating sites. They claim to use heuristic algorithms, but it may well be hokum.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You got Penny to sign up for online dating?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, of course not. No, I used trickery and deceit.</p>", "9701": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person.</p>", "9702": "<p><strong>Leslie:</strong> Wow. So, I heard your relationship with Penny crashed to the ground like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Where did you hear that?<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Actually I read it. Wolowitz texted me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (Reading the text) \"Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory.\" Yep.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> I thought it was a pretty good one, I gave him an L-O-L.</p>", "9703": "<p><strong>Leslie:</strong> Oh. So, how many children do you think we should have?<br/>\n(Leonard splutters)<br/>\nI'm sorry, that was a little abrupt.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> A little.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> I mean there are so many things to talk about before we discuss reproduction.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I sure hope so.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Besides shortness, what genetic weaknesses run in your family?</p>", "9704": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I think tonight was a very good start.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Me too. You're sure you're okay postponing intercourse until our relationship is past the initial viability test?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No problem, I'm very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess I'll call you and we'll arrange another evening.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Yes. I believe protocol dictates that you wait a minimum of 18 hours before you call so I'm not repulsed by your cloying eagerness.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Again, it's your decision, you're the man.</p>", "9705": "<p><strong>Leslie:</strong> Hey fellow scientists. Sheldon.</p>", "9706": "<p><strong>Leslie:</strong> You agree with me, right, loop quantum gravity is the future of physics.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sorry Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Well, I'm glad I found out the truth about you before this went any further.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Truth, what truth? We're talking about untested hypotheses, uh, it's no big deal.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Oh, it isn't, really? Tell me Leonard, how would we raise the children?</br></p>", "9707": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I guess we let them wait until they're old enough and let them choose their own theory.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> We can't let them choose, Leonard, they're children!</p>", "9708": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That was not fifteenth century soap. My God, these people need to learn you can't just put \"ye olde\" in front of anything and expect to get away with it.</p>", "9709": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Friday's always vintage game night. Look, my mom included the memory card. We can pick up where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anaemia.</p>", "9710": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?</p>", "9711": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> He just doesn't know he wants one because he's never had one.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I suppose that's possible, but for the record, I've never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one.</p>", "9712": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, I am in the Halo battle of my life here. There's this kid in Copenhagen. He has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24/7.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Can't you play him some other time?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not if you believe his doctors.</p>", "9713": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country, but when they're afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I really don't think the colonoscopy was necessary.</p>", "9714": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> A time machine from the movie The Time Machine?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, a time machine from Sophie's Choice.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it? It's rough.</p>", "9715": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> It's actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Cocktail shrimp are $12.50.</p>", "9716": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions: the sub-terranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Talk about your chick magnets.</p>", "9717": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Gentlemen, I know we said we'd take turns, but I think youd agree that practicality dictates it remain here.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You can't just keep it here. What if I meet a girl and say, \"you wanna come up and see my time machine, it's at my friends house,\" how lame is that?</p>", "9718": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Alright, I think we're going to need some ground rules. In addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Seconded.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I was going to put down a towel.</p>", "9719": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I have a solution. First go into the future and obtain a cloaking device.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ooh, how far into the future?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10th, 2328.</p>", "9720": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide, I slipped and skinned my knee.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you okay?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family, who insisted I stay for lunch.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That doesn't sound too bad.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son.</br></p>", "9721": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, is that really necessary? If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's not about money.</p>", "9722": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, do you want to buy me out or not?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and we'll put it on my balcony.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Screw his balcony, I'll give you a hundred and twenty and we'll put it in my garage.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I paid two hundred dollars for my share.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot.</p>", "9723": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Three hundred, and I'll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I'm getting rid of all of it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You can't do that. Look what you've created here, it's like nerdvana.</p>", "9724": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Too bad, I called dibs.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well you can't just call dibs.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I can and I did. Look up dibs on Wikipedia.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war.</p>", "9725": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's the number? I'll match it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'll match it, plus a thousand rupees.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What's the exchange rate?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> None of your business.</p>", "9726": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got? Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in Israel.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Forget it guys. If I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Who cares, as long as you pick me.</p>", "9727": "<p><strong>Dr. Gablehauser:</strong> Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Dennis Kim. Dennis is a highly sought after doctorial candidate and we're hoping to have him do his graduate work here.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Graduate work, very impressive.<br/><strong>Dr. Gablehauser:</strong> And he's only fifteen years old.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not bad, I myself started graduate school at fourteen.<br/><strong>Dennis Kim:</strong> Well, I lost a year while my family was tunneling out of North Korea.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Advantage Kim.</p>", "9728": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, Sheldon, you don't have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them.</p>", "9729": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes. That's what a rational person does when his entire life's work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, I'm confused again. Is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?</p>", "9730": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Go away.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Did Leonard tell you to say that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, I thought of it all by myself.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Huh. It can't be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I'm missing.</p>", "9731": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Go away!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Curiouser and curiouser.</p>", "9732": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> (Entering the apartment) Is he here?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> If he were, I wouldn't be.</p>", "9733": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> He'll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Then our problem would be solved.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? ... I'm not saying no.</p>", "9734": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That won't happen, he's not interested in anything but physics.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What about biology?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know, biology? The one thing that can completely derail a world class mind.</p>", "9735": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Howard, he's fifteen.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, so, when I was fifteen I met Denise Palmeri and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> She was sleeping with you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did.</br></p>", "9736": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong>  (Opening her apartment door) Oh, hey guys, what's up?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Howard, that's racist. Any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick. (Penny slams the door.)<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's possible she may have misunderstood us.</p>", "9737": "<p><strong>Dr. Gablehauser:</strong> Why are all these young women here?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's take your daughter to work day.<br/><strong>Dr. Gablehauser:</strong>: Really? I was not aware of that.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16.</p>", "9738": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, uh, how about her?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you're the one holding her head out of the toilet while she's puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn't even know you.</p>", "9739": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is that a dog?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> In the lab?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes. They're training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, I have to go.</p>", "9740": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> There's a Planet of the Apes marathon at the New Art today.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Five movies, two hours apiece. It's a start.</p>", "9741": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, what do you want?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I want soup.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Why didn't you just ... Why didn't you just have soup at home?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny, I have an IQ of 187. Don't you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You can have soup delivered.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I did not think of that.</p>", "9742": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, sweetie, I'll take care of you. What do you need?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, ground rules: no sponge baths and definitely no enemas.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Agreed.</p>", "9743": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, Sheldon, can't you do that yourself?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Vaporub makes my hands smell funny.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> But Sheldon-<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I can't believe I'm doing this.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats.</p>", "9744": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I had to, you see what he's like.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny! Penny, I'm hungry.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, it's okay, sweetie. Good news, Leonard's home!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No!</p>", "9745": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I couldn't say that. I would have to say, \"You were terrific and I can't wait to hear you sing again.\"<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's the social protocol. It's what you do when you have a friend who's proud of something they really suck at.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was not aware of that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well now you are.</p>", "9746": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Anyway, Penny now believes that on Friday night, we're going to participate in my cousin Leopold's drug intervention.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Your cousin Leopold?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yea, who most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee. Remember that, it's important.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What's important?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Details, Leonard. The success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details.</p>", "9747": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> No, it's okay, it's your Millenium Falcon. You and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening.</p>", "9748": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Who are you?<br/><strong>Toby:</strong> I am Sheldon's cousin Leo.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.<br/><strong>Toby:</strong> Au contraire. I'm 26 years old. I'm originally from (reads off character profile) Denton, Texas, but I was a Navy brat so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world. As a result, I've often felt like an outsider, never really fitting in, which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention.<br/><strong>Toby:</strong> Oh, Sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology.</p>", "9749": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, Leonard. This is Toby Loobenfeld. He's a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theater at MIT.<br/><strong>Toby:</strong> It was more of a double major actually. Theater and physics. You can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, I got it.</p>", "9750": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> The only thing missing from that insult was \"yo momma.\"<br><strong>Howard:</strong> I've got one. Hey, Leonard, your momma's research methodology is so flawed-<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Shut up, Howard.</br></p>", "9751": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, you know, isn't there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No. No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesize facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy.</p>", "9752": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Alright, moving on. Oh, wow, a paisley shirt.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> If you mean it should end up in the same place then, I agree.</p>", "9753": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You should just talk to him, I'm sure you guys can work this out.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's certainly preferable to my plan.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Which was?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> A powerful laxative.</p>", "9754": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Were you trying to impress Penny?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, no not at all. ... A little bit.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How'd that work out for you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (entering the apartment) Leonard, ready to go?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Libido 1, Truth 0.</p>", "9755": "<p>(Raj introducing his friends to his parents on video chat)<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hi!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> And over here is Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> He lives with Leonard.<br/><strong>Mrs. Koothrappali:</strong> Oh, that's nice. Like Haroun and Tanweer.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No, no, not like Haroun and Tanweer.</p>", "9756": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> So, are you boys academics like our son?<br/><strong>Guys:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> And your parents are comfortable with your limited earning potential?<br/><strong>Guys:</strong> Not at all.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Papa, please don't start.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> God, its just a question, hes so sensitive.</p>", "9757": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Dr. and Mrs. Koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasn't entirely Rajs fault.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> This is a family matter Sheldon.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I'm Leonard.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> Oh, sorry, you all look alike to us.</p>", "9758": "<p><strong>Leslie:</strong> Is it the waitress?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Penny? What about her?<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Well, I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her, which, unless you're a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction.</p>", "9759": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard, I didn't know you played the cello?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn't getting me beaten up enough.</p>", "9760": "<p><strong>Leslie:</strong> I admire your fingering.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Maybe some time you can try that on my instrument.</p>", "9761": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Alright, I'm moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh?</p>", "9762": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hang on, honey. Shiva and Ganesh? The Hindu Gods against the entire Union army?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And Orcs!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'll be back.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps.</p>", "9763": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, do you know who's in there?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, there's Leonard. ... (Picking up violin case) And he's either with Leslie Winkle or a 1930s gangster.</p>", "9764": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Boy, you're wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse.</p>", "9765": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you. What did she mean, \"she's happy for me\"? Is she happy because I'm seeing someone or is she happy because she thinks that I'm happy? Because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person.</p>", "9766": "<p><strong>Leslie:</strong> Uh, what are you doing?<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Okay, uh, what exactly do you think's going on between us?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm not sure, but I think I'm about to discover how the banana felt.</br></p>", "9767": "<p><strong>Leslie:</strong> Listen, Leonard, neither of us are neuroscientists but we both understand the biochemistry of sex. I mean, dopamine in our brains is released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's brain, give him an orgasm button, he'll push that thing until he starves to death. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Who wouldn't?<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Well, the only difference between us and a rat is that you can't stick an electrode in our hypothalamus. That's where you come in.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, well, I'm just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?<br/><strong>Leslie:</strong> Well, I don't know about your sex drive, but I'm probably good till New Years.</p>", "9768": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Are you even listening to me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course I'm listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah.</p>", "9769": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Don't just stand there. Slash and move, slash and move.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Stay in formation.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Leonard, you've got one on your tail.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's all right. My tails prehensile, I'll swat him off.</p>", "9770": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Leonard, look out!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Dammit man, we're dying here.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Goodbye, peasants.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The bastard teleported.</p>", "9771": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sounds like your neighbor's home.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Excuse me.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you'd have an excuse to talk to her.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, right. Right, right, right, right.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Stealing snail mail, very old school, I like it.</p>", "9772": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Penny for your thoughts.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What's the matter.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I'm fine. Penny's fine, the guy she's kissing is really fine and...<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Kissing, what kind of kissing? Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What is wrong with you?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I'm a romantic.</p>", "9773": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Please don't tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, I'm not jealous. I'm just a little concerned for her. I didn't like the look of the guy that she was with.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Because he looked better than you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.</p>", "9774": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I'm done with Penny. I'm going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Like who?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know. Olivia Geiger?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The dietitian at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I don't think you have a shot there.</p>", "9775": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know, you guys work in the same lab.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> There are pitfalls. Trust me, I know. When it comes to sexual harassment law I'm ... a bit of a self-taught expert.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Look, Howard, if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner. I'm not going to walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, then you're probably okay.</p>", "9776": "<p><strong>Leslie Winkle:</strong> Hang on. I'm trying to see how long it takes a five hundred kilowatt oxygen iodine laser to heat up my cup o' noodles.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Pfff, I've done it. About two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone.</p>", "9777": "<p><strong>Leslie Winkle:</strong> What sort of experiment would you propose?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> There is a generally accepted pattern in this area, I would pick you up, take you to a restaurant, then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock.<br/><strong>Leslie Winkle:</strong> Interesting. And would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the bio-chemical reaction during the goodnight kiss.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Heart rate, pheromones, etc, yes.</p>", "9778": "<p><strong>Leslie Winkle:</strong> Well, why don't we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You mean, kiss you now?<br/><strong>Leslie Winkle:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can you define the parameters of the kiss?<br/><strong>Leslie Winkle:</strong> Closed mouth but romantic. Mint?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Thank you. (Takes mint). Shall I count down from three?<br/><strong>Leslie Winkle:</strong> No, I think it needs to be spontaneous.</p>", "9779": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I've seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious Emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I don't know if I can take it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You could power down.</p>", "9780": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Good afternoon, Penny. So, hi, hey. Uh, I was wondering if you had plans for dinner.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, do you mean dinner tonight?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Supper?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Or dinner. I was thinking six thirty, if you can go, or a different time.</br></p>", "9781": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, six thirty's great.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? Great!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Us guys?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj. Who else's coming?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> They ... might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there. Uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns. For example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn't. It's no fault of Quizznos, they have a varied menu.</p>", "9782": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How do I look?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Could you be more specific?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely.</p>", "9783": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> By the way, if it should ever come up, you didn't join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why would I join you?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No reason.</p>", "9784": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy. There's no reason we couldn't go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, \"you love pottery? I love pottery!\" You know, there's a pause, we both know what's happening. I lean in, we kiss, it's a little tentative at first but then I realise, she's kissing me back, and she's biting my lower lip. You know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, we're going to have sex! Oh God! Oh, my God!</p>", "9785": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Give me the phone.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> But I thought you wanted to cancel?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I can't because if I don't show up she'll still be expecting you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why would she be expecting me?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Stop asking me all these questions, I need to take another shower.</p>", "9786": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, what's new in the world of physics?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Nothing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really, nothing?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930s. And you can't prove string theory, at best you can say \u201cHey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.\u201d<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Ah. Well I'm sure things will pick up.</p>", "9787": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Was this supposed to be a date?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> This? No. No, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn't show up, because of work and a colonoscopy.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, I was just checking.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> When I take a girl out on a date, and I do, she knows she\u2019s been dated. Capital D. Bold face, underline, like Day-ted.<br/>\nI think I might have a little concussion, I'm going to go lay down for a while. Good night.</p>", "9788": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> There you go, Pad Thai, no peanuts.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> But does it have peanut oil?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, I'm not sure. Everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Since it's not bee season, you can have my epinephrine.</p>", "9789": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How was work?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, you know, it's the Cheesecake Factory. People order cheesecake, and I bring it to them.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> So, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage.</p>", "9790": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Haven't you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, I haven't.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Get used to it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, I probably won't.</p>", "9791": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey Raj! (silence) Still not talking to me, huh?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't take it personally. It's his pathology. He can't talk to women.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> He can't talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecakescented Goddess!</p>", "9792": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Challenge accepted. (Tries to open the apartment door.) We're locked out.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Also, the pretty girl left.</p>", "9793": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Men do things for women without expecting sex.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, those are men who just had sex.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I'm doing this to be a good neighbor. In any case, there's no way it could lower the odds.</p>", "9794": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organize and label the entire world around them?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No.</p>", "9795": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You might want to speak in a lower register.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they'll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That's ridiculous. (Penny snores.)<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, (lowering his voice) that's ridiculous.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (In a lower register) Fine. I accept your premise, now please let's go.</br></p>", "9796": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am truly sorry for what happened last night. I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won't color your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover. (Penny slams the door in Sheldon's face)</p>", "9797": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hello, sorry I'm late. But I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee.</p>", "9798": "<p>*Leonard tries to slip a note under Penny's apartment door*<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What's going on?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Um, here's the thing. (Reads from the note.) Penny, just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgment. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognize one's mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie's discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of Ebola research-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Leonard.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (hugs him) We're okay.</p>", "9799": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Six two inch dowels.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Check.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> One package, Phillips head screws.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Check.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay. I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve. I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media center.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, please. We insist, it's the least we can do considering.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Considering what? How great this place looks?</p>", "9800": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> It is an inefficient design. For example, Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> We could put her stereo back there.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> And control it how?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy.</p>", "9801": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, no. You save your apologies for after you've had disappointing coitus with Penny.</p>", "9802": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, my metatarsals are barking.</p>", "9803": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> The only way she'd be able to make a contribution to science is if they resume sending chimps into space. </p>", "9804": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So what are you working on these days?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What would a one-celled organism have to feel ashamed about?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Same as all of us. Getting out of a car without underwear.</p>", "9805": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm not interested in being published in Mad Magazine. Zingers fly fast in the Thunderdome, Barry.</p>", "9806": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> So, I'm glad you guys are here. There's something I want to share with you. Howie and I are going to-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (phone beeps) Leonard says you're pregnant.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> \"Don't say anything. Act surprised when she tells you.\" All right, how you want to do this?</p>", "9807": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You know, Amy, I don't understand. Are we broken up or not? It's like you can't make up your mind.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's because you're not giving me any space to think.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, you should think fast. Because men can sire offspring their entire life, but those eggs you're toting around have a sell-by date.</p>", "9808": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I just hope I did the right thing.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I'm sure you did. Maybe that's the problem, you always do the right thing. Maybe it's time to do the wrong thing?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Like you're doing right now?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Exactly.</p>", "9809": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> What happened? They just got married.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. It's a mess. They had a huge fight in Vegas.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You think they'll break up?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I don't know. Sounds pretty bad. Penny's back in her apartment all by herself.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Really?</p>", "9810": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Bernadette's nickname for you is the Virgin Pina Colada.</p>", "9811": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Of course it's not a big deal to you. You idolize me and nothing could knock me off that pedestal you put me on.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> It's true. You are a God to me.</br></p>", "9812": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.</p>", "9813": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, you were born in Trivandrum? Have you ever been to the Kuthira Malika Palace?<br/><strong>Ruchi:</strong> No, I haven't.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Me, either. What a small world.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> I've also never been there. I've never been lots of places. Go on, quiz me.</p>", "9814": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, what do you want us to do?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't know. You're scientists; cheer them up.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> \"Cheer them up\"? Do you even know what a scientist is?</p>", "9815": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It's fine. I don't need to be a theoretical physicist. There's lots of things I could use this brain for. I could be an accountant for the mob. I could guess people's weight at the fair.</p>", "9816": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Ooh, check out the stripper pole.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You know what that means.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That Raj'll be on it before we make it to the freeway?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You know it!</p>", "9817": "<p><strong>Dr. Gallo:</strong> Let's put that aside for a minute and talk about why you married Leonard.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> (whispering) I don't wanna.<br/><strong>Dr. Gallo:</strong> Here is a man raised by an overbearing woman who completely dominated every aspect of his formative years. Do you think he's perpetuating that relationship by seeking out a partner like you?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot. That was a big selling point.</p>", "9818": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was the nation's smartest caterpillar and after pupating in our nation's railway system, I have burst forth as the world's smartest butterfly.</p>", "9819": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Got it. We order calzones, cut them open and eat them like pizza. ... All right, all right. I'll shake the brain bush one more time and see what falls out.</p>", "9820": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> How about the Asian Fusion place?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Fusion and Asians? I'm trying not to think about science.</p>", "9821": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn't been such a hound dog, wed all have time machines.\n</p>", "9822": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Sheldon, I can't believe you got us a wedding gift.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I don't know why you're so surprised. I watch movies. I see what people do.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What is this?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That is so great!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, there's fisherman's wharf, and Alcatraz, and cable cars. We're gonna have so much fun.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> We?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Is there a problem?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, no, no. I just said \"Weeee!\"</p>", "9823": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, if you want romance then let's have romance. Oh look, there's wine. Mmm, grape juice that burns! Now let's gaze into each other's eyes. You blinked, I win.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon!<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Let's see what's next. Oh, kissing's romantic.<br/>\n*Sheldon kisses Amy*<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That was nice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Good.</p>", "9824": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Although I-<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It's me, Sheldon. He-He's calling me a baby.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I don't know. I saw Leonard put his keys in his mouth today.</p>", "9825": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, guys, there's a change of plans. We are having a party for Halley's birthday after all. Turns out Bernadette and \"anyone who's not a heartless monster\" thinks that's the right thing to do.</p>", "9826": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Are you kidding me? You're not gonna invite me to Halley's birthday? I'm her godfather; that means something.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Or - hear me out on this - it doesn't.</br></p>", "9827": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So-so-so you're just apologizing because you need something?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yes, and I think it's pretty mature of me to admit it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, that's very insulting.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Right again.</p>", "9828": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> This is awkward. I was actually gonna return this.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> What's wrong with it?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I-I finished it.</p>", "9829": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Maybe we should double date. I'll bring Penny and you can bring your mom.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, make your jokes, but my date started a savings account for me. Did yours?</p>", "9830": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> So do you have it?<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> Of course I do. Penny gave it to me as a gift. You don't get rid of something like that.</p>", "9831": "<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Oh, also, there was that video about how much she missed you.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What video?<br/><strong>Zack:</strong> The one on the laptop. I didn't mean to invade your privacy, but I am a huge snoop. Ask my neighbor. She'll tell you. But not right now; she's in the shower.</p>", "9832": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I really appreciate the thought, but it's not necessary. I'll be back soon.<br/><strong>Ruchi:</strong> Don't worry about work. You take all the time you need.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, just turn off your brain and let your uterus do its magic. It's the star of the show now.</p>", "9833": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> We can have \"take charge\" attitudes.<br/><strong>Colonel Williams:</strong> Then why didn't either of you ask to be team leader?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> We didn't want to step on anyone's toes.</p>", "9834": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What do you want to watch?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, why don't you pick.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, how about comedy?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Eh, I already laughed today.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I know. It was when I stubbed my toe.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (chuckles) Still funny.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Drama?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Nah, I've already seen someone cry today.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It really hurt, Sheldon!</p>", "9835": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> So it turns out Ruchi is totally trying to take over Bernadette's projects.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wow, she just told you that out of the blue?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, yeah, we had just made love. It was so beautiful. Our caramel-colored bodies were entwined like erotic taffy-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Get to the point!</p>", "9836": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, sorry, uh, yeah. I asked her about work, and she just admitted she has her eyes on Bernadette's projects.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Can't believe she would take advantage of a pregnant lady like that. So what did you do?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> What do you think I did? I made small talk for 20 minutes and had sex again.</p>", "9837": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You have to say something to Bernie.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know. If I do that, she's gonna confront Ruchi, and then Ruchi's gonna stop sleeping with me.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Raj, you can't go on sleeping with a woman who's trying to screw over your friend.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Can't or must?</p>", "9838": "<p><strong>Ruchi:</strong> Can I ask you a question? Mm? Does a drug still count as an antidepressant if its number one side effect is uncontrollable weeping?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I don't know. I always feel better after a good cry.</p>", "9839": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Sorry things worked out like that.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Because I'm in pain or because you don't have a spy anymore?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Let's just leave it at \"I'm sorry.\" You're already sad.</p>", "9840": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> All right! Who's excited to see a documentary?<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, I know this one. Nobody. Ever.</br></p>", "9841": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I just know how much Professor Proton touched me as a child, and I feel that I owe it to him to try and touch as many children as possible.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You should put that on your audition tape.</p>", "9842": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Don't be silly. I'll take the rest of the day off and watch Halley for you.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Or we can call Stuart. I'm sure he could close up the store, hop on a bus, and be here in no time.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> He does love the bus.</p>", "9843": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, how you doing?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What are you doing here?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, I just came by, you know, to see if you need any help.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Howard and Bernadette asked you to check up on me.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> That is not entirely true. So did Leonard and everybody.</p>", "9844": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> How irresponsible do you all think I am?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> We don't think you're irresponsible. We think you're fun-loving.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That is just a nice word for \"irresponsible.\"<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hmm. You might be more on the ball than we thought.</p>", "9845": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> It is a big deal. Howard's getting Amy used to laughing and listening to music. What if she expects that madness at home?</p>", "9846": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You know, she's been opening up about her life, and she's actually been really supportive about mine.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah. I've been telling her about my job, and she said she was proud of me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, that's great. Never told me she was proud of me. Even when I stayed dry for a whole month.</p>", "9847": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Do you not want me to be friends with your mom?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, let's be clear. I-I married you to hurt her. You're kind of ruining it.</p>", "9848": "<p><strong>Ruchi:</strong> I'm sorry, we're being rude talking about India.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, yeah, you know, if you and Bernadette want to talk about America, that's cool with us. Here, let me get you started. (In an American accent) Hamburgers, am I right?</p>", "9849": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Anyway, I figured I can hang out with my friends and have fun too. <br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well if your idea of fun is riding in a minivan to Target for diapers, things are about to get nuts.</p>", "9850": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Don't you even feel a little bad sponging off your friends?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hey, look, I went to art college, I tried to make it as a graphic artist, a comic book artist, and you know what I got for my efforts? A visible rib cage. I'm not kidding. You can see my heart beating.</p>", "9851": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> I even said \"off the chain mail,\" and she still wants to go.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's probably my fault. She may have heard about my cool Dumbledore costume.</p>", "9852": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, hey. If you knocked, I couldn't hear you. I'm welding this locomotive engine. And if you didn't knock, how about some manners?</p>", "9853": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie? You doing okay? You've been in there a while.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (In the bathroom) I'm fine. Be right out.<br/>\nAm I an American hero? Well, that's a good question, Jim. Dont you think once an astronaut leaves the planet, he's a hero to all the nations of the Earth? (Toilet flush) Okey dokey. I think I have time for one more question.</p>", "9854": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh, good.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, thank God.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> You guys been here long?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> No, two minutes.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> But yes.</p>", "9855": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> So, Claire, we've heard so many wonderful things about you.<br><strong>Claire:</strong> Really? Like what?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Uh, mostly Penny's heard them.</br></p>", "9856": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You have any idea what you're getting Sheldon for his birthday?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> He's been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. Maybe we could get him a fossil.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, just don't get anything Jurassic. He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood.</p>", "9857": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> This is ridiculous. You know, I'm gonna go talk to the matre d'.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you gonna say?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't know. I'm ... I'm gonna flirt with him.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I'm still sleeping with you tonight.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> See if you can get a table by the window.</p>", "9858": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Next we need a teaspoon of pepper, which, I believe, was also the name of your childhood dog.</p>", "9859": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Sorry. It's just you're you, you know? And I really want you to adopt me.<br/><strong>Elon Musk:</strong> Well, you're here on Thanksgiving, so you're probably a good person.</p>", "9860": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Um listen, I really enjoyed spending this morning with you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I can't take all the credit. It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way.<br/></p>", "9861": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Here are some topics that interest me. Quantum mechanics, trains, flags--<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, no, it's about my acting career.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry, that's not on the list.</p>", "9862": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Come on, open it. I bet it says something great.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is Asian fusion. For all you know there's a tiny chihuahua in there.</p>", "9863": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Should you really be sitting in Sheldon's spot?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> He's in Texas, he'll never know.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wouldn't be so sure about that.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Look, it's true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up.</p>", "9864": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Ooh, I'm going to check the fridge and see if there are any clues inside a beer.</p>", "9865": "<p><strong>Professor Proton:</strong>  Sheldon, in a couple of hours I have to get up, pee and then wander around the house.</p>", "9866": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> As it happens, I'm also spending the day with a beloved children's science personality. Isn't that right, new friend and colleague Bill Nye, the Science Guy?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model.</p>", "9867": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> (To Raj, slipping him a dollar) Yeah, nice speech, Francine.</p>", "9868": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy. How are you?<br/><strong>Mrs. Koothrappali:</strong> We're very rich in a very poor country. So, all in all, can't complain.</p>", "9869": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. </p>", "9870": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Be right back. I gotta floss the Indian food out of my teeth if I'm going to eat Chinese.</p>", "9871": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I've been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioral aspects, and I think there's a problem with the current version of our lie.<br><strong>Leonard:</strong> What are you talking about? It's fine. She bought it. It's over.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Sadly, it's not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realized that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Why not?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Because Leo is a middle child.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> There is no Leo. How can you say that?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You didn't read the bio, did you? He's not just a middle child, he's the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I've got a solution.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Great, what is it?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Get out.</br></p>", "9872": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Are you sure you don't want to go to the emergency room?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> No, no, I'm okay, it's stopped bleeding.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I know, but you did throw up. Isn't that a sign of a concussion?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yes, but I get car sick too, so...<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Sorry about your car, by the way.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, no, it's fine, you got most of it out the window.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> The poor guy on the bike.</p>", "9873": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If I'd known this was about time travel, I'd have watched this much sooner.</p>", "9874": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sensing awkwardness. Am I right?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yes.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Swish.</p>", "9875": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, I'm not okay. I'm wearing borrowed pants, I don't have ID, and one of the officers here won't stop calling me chicken legs.</p>", "9876": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Almost there. You're doing great.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box.</p>", "9877": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> If you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress ... I'm not going to tell you why movie stars are the best, they just are.</p>", "9878": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh apple juice stay where you are.</p>", "9879": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard, let me tell you something. Personal robots cannot get here soon enough.</p>", "9880": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> I've known you a long time. You believe in romance more than any person I've ever met and it's hard to see you give up on that. But if you really think marrying this woman is gonna make you happy, then you have my complete and total support.<br/>\nI will be with you every step of the way.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thanks, Howard. That means a lot.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> So, hey, is this wedding gonna be in India?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ah, maybe.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Urgh.</p>", "9881": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, why didn't you invite him in the first place?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You don't know what it was like growing up with him.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I get it; I grew up with lots of brothers. My brother Adoot was especially mean.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Really? I've never heard you mention Adoot.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, sure I have. He's the one who left the door open when we were kids, and my pet mongoose ran away. Stupid Adoot.</p>", "9882": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So, how was your date?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It was going well until my eye dripped in her latte.</p>", "9883": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, this is the life. What could be better than this?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong>  If you weren't wearing one of my swimsuits.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> I'll give it back.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> (chuckles) You know the rule. Once it touches hiney, it's no longer miney.</p>", "9884": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> We should name it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> The drone, or your stupid robot show?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> The drone. The show's already got a name, General Bot-spital.</p>", "9885": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> We're not doing anything wrong. We're just hanging out in a hotel lobby. Plenty of people do that: businessmen, high-end prostitutes.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> That's a fun new game, CEO or Ho.</br></p>", "9886": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Some people name their kids after places.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong>  Like what, Walla Walla Wolowitz?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> If you think that is better than Ozymandias Wolowitz, then you have been breathing in the poisonous gas that my troops illegally dispersed.</p>", "9887": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yeah, I like the name Elliott. That wasn't on my list, but I like it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> We've heard your names. They're ridiculous. And I have a cousin named Dilip.</p>", "9888": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, I have to finish writing it before they can make it into a movie, and I still have a few things to figure out.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You should talk to Bernadette. Since she's been on bed rest, she's binged, like, every detective show in the world.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, there was a funny detective show in India called Karamchand. He had an assistant named Kitty, and he was always saying, \"Shut up, Kitty!\" Sounds less mean if you say it in Hindi and don't think of women as having feelings.</p>", "9889": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello, Stuart.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, hey, Sheldon. Can I interest you in a cappuccino?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When did you start selling those?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Oh, someone left it here, but it's still warm. Say four bucks?</p>", "9890": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, what you making?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, well, I spilled the cheese packet, so we're having mac and nothing.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, yeah, I'll just have the mac. \"Nothing\" gives me gas.</p>", "9891": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Although, if you want to be a part of the wedding party, I suppose you could be the flower girl.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Sold.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, I thought Halley was gonna be the flower girl.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, that's much better. Sorry, Stuart, you're out.</p>", "9892": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, so is Bernadette okay with me being maid of honor?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Actually, I haven't had the courage to tell her.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I guess I should do that.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Uh, yeah.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Although, as maid of honor, your job is to make my life easier.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Damn it. Hey, Stuart, you still want in on this wedding?<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Not that much.</p>", "9893": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So Leonard, tell everyone your news.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, oh, I'm starting a book.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That would be big news from Penny, but you've read a book before.</p>", "9894": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Uh-oh. They gave us plain rice instead of fried rice.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, no fair! I SoulCycled this morning. I'm entitled to a pile of fat rice.</p>", "9895": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> [In Mandarin] This is Howard Wolowitz. We didn't get our fried rice. My fat Indian friend is upset. Thank you.</p>", "9896": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, is that Raj there at girls' night? Well, hey.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, Howard.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Just remember, if you fall asleep first, they're gonna freeze your bra.</p>", "9897": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> It would be nice if they cast a woman.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, you've already got Doctor Who and the Ghostbusters. Leave us something.</p>", "9898": "<p><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Hi, Sheldon.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Here, I found this pizza flyer in your fence.<br/><strong>Wil Wheaton:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, now you owe me a favor. Turn down the role of Professor Proton.</p>", "9899": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Bernie!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Oh, damn.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Hey! What are the odds?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Yeah, seren-frickin'-dipity.</p>", "9900": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Okay, let's talk about something that won't infuriate my pregnant wife.<br><strong>Raj:</strong> I read an interesting fact about elephants.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Try again.</br></p>", "9901": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, guys.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, how's it going?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Pff.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> What? You got something to say?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I think I just said it. P-F-F. Pff!</p>", "9902": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Give me the bottle. I mean, it might be a little corny, but I say we pour one out for all the science homies who came before us.</p>", "9903": "<p><strong>Dr. Zane:</strong> I'm sorry, I'm sure you don't want to sit here and listen to a bunch of work talk.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, no, I love it. No, but let's talk about work. Amy's work, my work. Yeah, why don't we start with my work?</p>", "9904": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Will you with me?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> To do what? Shake a can of nickels at them?</p>", "9905": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> We're being ridiculous. There's no way a woman that attractive is trying to seduce Sheldon Cooper.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> You done trying to make yourself feel better?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> No. I haven't played the race card yet.</p>", "9906": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Okay, fine, let's say you never win a Nobel Prize. Let's say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you, not for what you've accomplished but for who you are as a man. Wouldn't that be a life well-lived?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You're so cute. I'm going to go learn how to walk on stilts.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> So many warnings.</p>", "9907": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Can't believe Bert has a girlfriend and I don't.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I thought you were taking a break from women to focus on your career.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, grow up.</p>", "9908": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Sheldon, you're sick, go back to bed.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> (stuffy) I am fine. Here, eat your toast. (sneezes on the toast) Sorry.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> It's okay, now I don't need butter.</p>", "9909": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Like all my underwear, that notebook says \"Property of Sheldon Cooper.\"</p>", "9910": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> So, relax. We're happy to have you.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you, but how do I know you're not saying that just to be nice?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Do you actually pay for that haircut?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> That'll do it.</p>", "9911": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Hey, what's it like sharing a bathroom with Penny? Is there hair everywhere? Does she use your loofah?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I don't have a loofah.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, well, if I move in, you can't use mine.</p>", "9912": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I know our apartment's small, but I think we can make room.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> No, Sheldon. We are not getting a life-size Spider-Man statue.</p>", "9913": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Howie, can you get that?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Kind of busy.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Busy like I'll be with the baby if you go to San Diego?</p>", "9914": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Okay, hold on, so if you don't want to go and I don't need to bring you, is everything good?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hold on, I'm trying to decide if I'm mad at you. No, I'm happy I don't have to go.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> All right, problem solved.</p>", "9915": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> (To Raj) Hey, if you're still looking to make money, I will pay you to burn that jacket.</p>", "9916": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> This morning, I fired my dog walker.<br><strong>Howard:</strong> Oh. How's the dog gonna go to the bathroom?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Uh, I gave her an Imodium. That's tomorrow's problem.</br></p>", "9917": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, I would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No. No, you don't, you really don't. I actually can't say \"don't\" enough.</p>", "9918": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Damn. I burped so hard, I died in my game.</p>", "9919": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> When we're sleeping, she breathes on me. One night, it got so bad I almost grabbed Toto and headed for the storm cellar.</p>", "9920": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Are we being silly not finding out the sex?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> If you want, you can find out right now.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hmm. The doctor's gone for the day, so it doesn't matter.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Or somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> You looked in our folder?!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> It was an accident. The doctor left the folder out on her desk. It's not my fault I opened it and looked.</p>", "9921": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> So you know the sex of our baby, and we don't?!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot.</p>", "9922": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> This is not a problem, okay? If you don't want to know, I don't have to tell you.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We don't want you to know!<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Okay, well, that's a problem.</p>", "9923": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Which side of the bed would you prefer?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Doesn't matter to me. Your choice.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> No, no, we're living together now. Everything's equal. I know that I have a tendency to be controlling, so I would rather you choose.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, clearly, it's not whatever I want, because what I want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I'm not refusing. I'm just trying to be considerate.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?</p>", "9924": "<p>(Amy enters from the ensuite bathroom after Sheldon overheard her pre-bed routine)<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Why'd you switch sides?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Be grateful I'm still in the room.</p>", "9925": "<p>*Leonard using his inhaler*<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I told you not to do the worm.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (out of breath) You were right.</p>", "9926": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I don't think I slept two minutes last night.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, get it, girl. It's not what you think.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I feel like I pulled something. Why didn't you tell me to stop?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Even more not what you think.</p>", "9927": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> So, how is everyone?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Miserable and exhausted.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? I slept great.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Well, I didn't, and it's your fault.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> How? You had the whole floor to yourself.</p>", "9928": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I'm clearly upset. Why aren't you following me?</p>", "9929": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I am facing a great deal of work. And I do like things better when famous people also like them.</p>", "9930": "<p><strong>The Flash:</strong> But if you ever want to feel like you have superpowers, try one of these.<br><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?<br/><strong>The Flash:</strong> You bet. You know why Hulk is so strong? Steroids. You know why Batman wanders around at night getting into fights? Scotch.</br></p>", "9931": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I'm sure it's just 'cause I'm dating Sheldon.<br/><strong>Bert:</strong> Mm, actually, I think Sheldon's popular because he's dating you.</p>", "9932": "<p><strong>Marty:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, Marty. Thanks for talking to us.<br/><strong>Marty:</strong> Hey, no problem. Thanks for going to outer space so no matter what I do my mom will be disappointed in me.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Well, I married a little Catholic girl, so we're even.</p>", "9933": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Do you have any advice for us?<br/><strong>Marty:</strong> Well, I don't know much about patent law. But, uh, my advice is: hear them out, offer as little information as possible, and whatever you do, don't sign anything.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> \"Don't sign anything\"? That's your advice? Okay, so, uh, if during this meeting, one of us were to, say, complete an oil painting, you'd recommend that we leave that unsigned?<br/><strong>Marty:</strong> That's not what I meant.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's what you said.<br/><strong>Marty:</strong> That's not what I meant.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton, by saying things you don't mean and meaning things you don't say.</p>", "9934": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I've worked so hard to get where I am, and I don't want to get sent back to square one because I'm pregnant.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I understand how you feel.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Thank you.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> I wish there were some way I could make it better.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, you brought me French fries. That's a start.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Uh, actually, I got you apple slices 'cause you're pregnant.</p>", "9935": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> What are you doing?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Oh, Leonard's mad at me, so I'm making him lemon bars.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Does he even like lemon bars?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Not really. But I'm mad at him, too, so lemon bars it is.</p>", "9936": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> You threatened to sue?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Hey, I learned a long time ago, when you're four feet eleven and eye level with every guy's crotch, that's where you punch.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> That's funny. I learned something totally different.</p>", "9937": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Okay, Beverly, aren't you overreacting a little? All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And turned their phones off.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Not helping, buddy!</p>", "9938": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> It didn't help that you couldn't walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> I have performance anxiety. You of all people should know that.</p>", "9939": "<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Well, fine, if everyone wants to make jokes about our problems, then I can, too. Knock, knock.<br/>\nWho's there? Our family is an embarrassment.<br/><strong>Randall:</strong> That's not much of a joke.</p>", "9940": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hang on, hang on! We're smart, we can figure this out. Okay, so: Mary and Beverly can't be together. Uh, Alfred and Beverly can't be together. Leonard and I can't be together. Now, I could be with Alfred but I don't like his face.</p>", "9941": "<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Oh, Leonard! It's so nice to see you again!<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, you, too! Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverly.<br/>\nBeverly: Hello.<br/><strong>Susan:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Randall:</strong> We are not white trash!</p>", "9942": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?<br/><strong>Alfred Hofstadter:</strong> Yes, I am. I'm just feeling a little guilty about all the trouble I've caused.<br/><strong>Mary Cooper:</strong> Oh, so am I.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> You made God sad today, Mom.</p>", "9943": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Why wouldn't that colonel say what the meeting's about? It has to be bad news.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> That's really stupid advice.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> You know that hurts my feelings.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Calm down, try not to think about it.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> (upbeat) Okay.</p>", "9944": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Can I get anyone a drink?<br/><strong>Wyatt:</strong> Well, I could use another beer.<br/><strong>Susan:</strong> (loudly) You're done! (softly) He's done.</p>", "9945": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks. Tell me this isn't like the best episode of Sex and the City.</p>", "9946": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> We were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous.<br><strong>Amy:</strong> Oh, that sounds juicy.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Wait, I remember that. Hang on. You did it at our place?<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Kind of on Sheldon's bed.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> What?!<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No!<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out. Usually he says, \"Do not go in there,\" but this time he said, \"Hey, let's go in here.\"</br></p>", "9947": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hi.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, how'd it go?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Oh, great. Dr. Gallo is terrific. You know, I-I've always been insecure that no one cares about what I have to say, but she made me see-<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Yeah, no one cares. Did you help me out or not?</p>", "9948": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> \"So instead she asked if in the future Montana ever became a state.\"<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Hey, in the 1800s that was considered flirting.</p>", "9949": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You make a lot of sense. I like this table and I'm getting it.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Really, this one?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> That one.<br/>\n*Penny nods*<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Damn right I like that one.</p>", "9950": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> I'd love to babysit for you. Kids love me. Something about me just makes them waff and waff.</p>", "9951": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Payback, it truly is the B word, isn't it?</p>", "9952": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, sorry this took so long. But you used to work here, you know how it is.<br/><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Kitchen slammed again?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> No, I'm a terrible waitress, remember?</p>", "9953": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, Sheldon, you're always full of fun little facts. Where did the expression get your ass handed to you come from?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Don't know.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I wonder if it's from like ancient Rome where they'd actually chop somebody's ass off and then go, here. You know, to appease Loseroneous, the God of losers.</p>", "9954": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Leonard?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, hi, hi. How's it going?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Uh, can't complain. Thanks for asking. What were you doing out at three o'clock in the morning?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Well, uh - uh, what are you doing up?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I was using the bathroom.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Yeah, well, so was I.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Really? I didn't see you in there.</p>", "9955": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Please let me know when you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your self-abuse. I'm trying to stream a movie on Netflix in here.</p>", "9956": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What about Nebraska?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh hell with Nebraska. I'm gonna be a star!</p>", "9957": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> You okay?<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Yeah, yeah. I'm just breaking in some new shoes.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Very pretty.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Thank you. Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hadn't really thought about it.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Look.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Uh, sure. Very ... prominent.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Please, Leonard, don't leer. You have a girlfriend.</p>", "9958": "<p>Dr. Elizabeth Pimpton: Ah, Dr. Cooper, thank goodness. I completely forgot your address. But then I remembered that Id written it on my hand. Lucky for me, I didn't confuse it with what I'd written on my other hand, which are the coordinates for a newly discovered neutron star. 'cause if I tried to go there, I'd be crushed by hypergravity. Anyway, hello.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Hello.<br/>\nDr. Elizabeth Pimpton: Nice to finally meet you in person.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I would imagine it is.</p>", "9959": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> You're either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Which one picks last?<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> What?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Well, usually I'm on the team that picks last. Unless there's a kid in the wheelchair.</p>", "9960": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his attitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fiber requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows.</p>", "9961": "<p><strong>Barry Kripke:</strong> Are you crazy? This is a street fight. The street has no rules.</p>", "9962": "<p><strong>Stuart:</strong> If you still want to hang out as friends, I'd like that.<br><strong>Ruchi:</strong> Thanks, Stuart. I'd like that, too.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> And the fungus is under the toenail.</br></p>", "9963": "<p><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey. Missed you guys at the faculty mixer.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Ah, you should have been there; dessert was bananas. Sorry, that was misleading. The dessert was pie, but the pie was bananas. Actually, the pie was cherry, but the taste of the pie was bananas.</p>", "9964": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Your theories are pretty abstract. I wouldn't even know how to design an experiment to prove them.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Says the experimental physicist. Well, I know a place the university can make some cuts. Bye, Leonard!</p>", "9965": "<p><strong>Raj:</strong> You just have to wait for science to catch up or technology to get cheaper. Think about, uh, DVD players. They used to cost, like, a thousand dollars, but just the other day I used one to smash a bug.</p>", "9966": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Why are you wearing a Band-Aid?<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Halley bit me.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> (laughs) You got beaten up by a girl.<br/><strong>Howard:</strong> Hey, that's sexist.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> You're right. (laughs) You got beaten up by a baby.</p>", "9967": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> And besides, it's our birthday tradition.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> You think you can do it while I lie perfectly still and you don't touch me?<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I can try. (doesn't move, exhales) Want to do it again?</p>", "9968": "<p><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> I, too, was in a relationship with someone who made me feel bad about myself.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> If you're talking about Mom, I don't want to hear it.<br/><strong>Dr. Koothrappali:</strong> I'm just saying, if you replace Howard with a nice 22-year-old grad student, your self-confidence will soar.</p>", "9969": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Another fun sidenote, I went to high school with a girl named Theresa Gluino, but it didn't cost $2 billion to find her. She was smoking behind the gym.</p>", "9970": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> I'm sorry, can we do this another time? Amy's just about to realize she wants to watch a Hulk marathon.</p>", "9971": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> You know, I had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model, but I didn't say anything 'cause you're so sensitive. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Just because I'm easily bothered by light, heat, smell, sound, and the way birds look at me does not mean I'm sensitive.</p>", "9972": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Okay, well, uh, thank you, Stuart. That's a very generous offer.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> My pleasure. I-I understand the best man usually receives a present.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> That's true.<br/><strong>Stuart:</strong> Can never have too much Claritin.</p>", "9973": "<p><strong>Bernadette:</strong> Who's going to officiate?<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> I was kind of hoping you would.<br/><strong>Amy:</strong> Wait, now I'm just some lousy maid of honor?</p>", "9974": "<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Tempting choices, but I have something special planned for tonight.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?</p>", "9975": "<p><strong>Leonard:</strong> Hey, I am a young man in his sexual prime. Under the right conditions, I am capable of just, really crazy stuff.<br><strong>Penny:</strong> Really? What is the craziest thing you've ever done with a woman? And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count.<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> Come on, that's got to count. There was a really strong undertow. We could have died.</br></p>", "9976": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Hey, did he tell you I saved the silk shirt?<br/>\nPriya: No, he did not.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> He was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his Spider-man underwear. That's our Lenny, huh?<br/>\nPriya: Yes, that's our Lenny.</p>", "9977": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This is incredible! I'm so happy, I'm not even going to question their judgment in picking you. I'm just going to run home and start packing.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Why wouldn't you take Penny?<br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> I am taking Penny.<br/><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh. Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home.</p>", "9978": "<p><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Come on, Leonard, if you roll a six, Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?</p>", "9979": "<p><strong>Penny:</strong> Oh, alright. I will give you my bed on one condition. That you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> May I say one last thing.<br/><strong>Penny:</strong> Only if it doesn't rhyme.<br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Alright. Goodnight.</p>"}
