    "<p><strong>Michael:</strong><br/> I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon-sue me-and since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So most nights before I go to bed I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill. I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious. It's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot. That's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that.</p><p></p>",

    "<p><strong>Michael:</strong><br/> [re: downsizing] Am I going to tell them? No, I'm not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.</p><p></p>",
  "388":
    "<p><strong>Michael:</strong><br/> People I respect, heroes of mine, would be: Bob Hope, um, Abraham Lincoln, definitely, Bono... uh, and probably God would be the fourth one. And, I just think all those people really, uh, helped the world in so many ways, that it's, um, it's really beyond words. It's really incalculcable.</p><p></p>",

    "<p><strong>Michael:</strong><br/> Hi, I'm Michael Scott Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because Today is almost over.</p><p><strong>Michael:</strong><br/> Abraham Lincoln once said that 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North,' and those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.</p><p></p>",

    "<p><strong>Pam:</strong><br/> [during a role-playing exercise; to Dwight, who's supposed to be Asian] Okay, if I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue and that I do not agree with, you would maybe... not be a very good driver.</p><p><strong>Dwight:</strong><br/> Aw, man! Am I a woman? Aww! Boo!</p><p></p>",

What would you call that?</p><p><strong>Jim:</strong><br/> I thought you said you were inventing new diseases. That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.</p><p><strong>Pam:</strong><br/> Nice.</p><p></p>",
  "392":
    "<p><strong>Dwight:</strong><br/> OK, first let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?</p><p><strong>Michael:</strong><br/> Uh, none. You're picking a healthcare plan.</p><p></p>",
  "393":
    "<p><strong>Jim:</strong><br/> Dwight, don't you need health insurance?</p><p><strong>Dwight:</strong><br/> Don't need it. Perfect immunity. I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.</p><p><strong>Pam:</strong><br/> Why would you need to raise your cholesterol?</p><p><strong>Dwight:</strong><br/> So I can lower it.</p><p></p>",

  "395":
    "<p><strong>Michael:</strong><br/> When I retire, I-I don't want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I want to be the guy who gives everything back. I want it to be like: 'Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?' 'Umm, well, uh, I don't know. It was anonymous.' 'Well, guess what? That was Michael Scott!' 'But- it was anonymous, how do you know?' '...Because I'm him!'</p><p></p>",

  "400":
    "<p><strong>Michael:</strong><br/> A lot of the people here don't get trophies very often, like Meredith or Kevin, I mean who's going to give Kevin an award, Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, 'Hey, did you get an award?' And the neighbor will say, 'No man. I mean I slave all day and nobody notices me.' Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from the neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself, due to lack of recognition.</p><p></p>",

  "402":
    "<p><strong>Michael:</strong><br/> Attention everyone, hello! Yes, I just want you to know that this is not my decision but from here on out, we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here, we must only discuss work associated things. And uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future if I want to say something funny, or witty, or do an impression I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.</p><p><strong>Jim:</strong><br/> Does that include 'That's what she said?'</p><p><strong>Michael:</strong><br/> Mmm hmm, yes.</p><p><strong>Jim:</strong><br/> Wow. That is really hard. ...You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...</p><p><strong>Michael:</strong><br/> That's what she said!</p><p></p>",

    "<p><strong>Michael:</strong><br/> Toby is in HR, which technically means he works for corporate, so he's not really a part of our family. Also, he's divorced, so he's really not a part of his family.</p><p></p>",
  "404":
    "<p><strong>Dwight:</strong><br/> [to Toby] You said we could come to you if we had any questions... Where is the clitoris? On the website it said 'at the crest of the labia.' What does that mean? ...What does the female vagina look like?</p><p><strong>Toby:</strong><br/> [talking head] Technically, I am in Human Resources, and Dwight was asking me about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly.</p><p></p>",
  "405":
    "<p><strong>Dwight:</strong><br/> Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60-acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin Mose. We sell beets to the local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm... sometimes teenagers use it for sex.</p><p></p>",
  "406":
    "<p><strong>Dwight:</strong><br/> I have been Michael's number two guy for about 5 years, and we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart and I'm like... Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy and Michael is like... Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart, you're gonna get a bullet in the head, courtesy of Butch Cassidy.</p><p></p>",
  "407":
    "<p><strong>Michael:</strong><br/> Yes, I was the first one out. And yes, I've heard 'women and children first'. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweatshop, thankfully. And women are equal in the workplace by law. So if I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands.</p><p></p>",

  "411":
    "<p><strong>Dwight:</strong><br/> I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War Two veteran. Killed twenty men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied prison camp. My father... battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.</p><p></p>",
  "412":
    "<p><strong>Michael:</strong><br/> Would I rather be feared or loved? Umm... easy, both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me.</p><p></p>",

    "<p><strong>Jan:</strong><br/> Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?</p><p><strong>Michael:</strong><br/> No. No, that would not be efficient... Actually, they just don't get a lot of work done when I'm not here... That's not true. I know how to delegate. And they do more work when I'm not here... Not more... the same amount of work is done whether I am here or not.</p><p></p>",

    "<p><strong>Angela:</strong><br/> I actually look forward to performance reviews. I did the youth beauty pageant circuit, and I enjoyed that quite a bit. I really enjoy being judged. I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.</p><p></p>",
  "417":
    "<p><strong>Dwight:</strong><br/> I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records. As a volunteer sheriff I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories. Yeast infections... there are a huge number of yeast infections in this county. Probably because we're downriver from that old bread factory...</p><p></p>",

  "425":
    "<p><strong>Michael:</strong><br/> I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon-sue me-and since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So most nights before I go to bed I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill. I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious. It's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot. That's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that.</p><p></p>",

At that point, I would recommend you take a quick trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine blue cheese dressing.

Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious. It's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot.

In the morning the cops come, and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada - I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard: I have a son, and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocad\u00c3\u00a9ro.

I took a course at the Weintraub Memory Academy. Sat next to this woman named Beverly Brook. She had a Greek salad for lunch.

There was a Dwight impersonator and a Jim impersonator. A strongman crushed a turtle. I laughed and I cried. Not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company.</p><p></p>",
